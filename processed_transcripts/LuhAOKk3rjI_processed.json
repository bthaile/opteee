    "text": "What's up everyone? Welcome back to OutLayer's Happy Friday. We had a really interesting day, specifically from GME, if we're being completely honest, but well, we got feedback. Luke got to kill that. But so we have a different session in line for today. This is specifically a options trading workshop geared towards beginners. So we have a few things we're going to talk about. I have a couple topics that I've selected from conversations that I've seen that I actually want to work through with you. So you can chat in specific elements or questions about these topics that you have or concepts that you want to explore more deeply. And we can do that. And then I also have some questions that folks dropped on the YouTube post that I made about the event. So we'll hit those, but feel free to chat in at any point if there's something I'm talking about that you want to dive into. If there's an unrelated topic that you have in the back of your mind that you've been wanting to understand or explore, that is all fair game. My entire goal for you walking away from this, especially from a beginner's perspective is I would love if there are maybe three takeaways that you definitively can point at at the end of the session. So that's what I'm aiming to give you. The other thing is based on where we go during the session at the end of the session,",

All right. So to kick us off, let's start with talking a little bit about the traps of trading options. The reason why I want to start with this is because it is really, really important to understand the landscape that we're interacting with. So there's a few things I want to highlight here. The main thing is fully comprehending how important it is, what system can look like in the long run. So we'll get into that in just a second. So no use says no experience. Okay.

In general, it's completely misunderstood by most people because we think it's access to fast easy money. And it's not. It genuinely is not. Now, the cool part is because it is not that is where the opportunity lies. Imagine if we had a system that was just access to fast easy money, who wouldn't do that, right? AKA that would price the system out. It wouldn't exist anymore. So the fact that it's not like that is a massive opportunity. I've made a lot of money trading options from my start in 2007, millions of dollars, literally. However, that should not be misconstrued to me. And it's easy because it genuinely is not. So the important part here, in my opinion, is to understand what we're trying to do so that we can be more successful at doing it. Because if you come into this under the guise that this is easy money, you're probably going to apply the correct methodology for something that would be easy, meaning we're not putting a ton of effort. We're not actually trying that hard, because we think it's easy. And then it doesn't work. We don't want that. So all of this is to say, trading is difficult. But in my opinion, if you take it seriously, it is entirely worth the time and effort. That's what it boils",

That's all this means. There are a couple of resources here to give you some ideas. You can take a screenshot of this and to get an idea of what these documents are, how we integrate them. All of this boils down to here that just like in high school, in college, whatever your education is, at some point you would have been handed a syllabus. That syllabus outlines what you're doing, what how you grade and assess your proficiency, those kinds of details are captured in there. That's what this series of documents are designed to do to provide that kind of structure for you. That's all. Okay. Now, let's talk about where kind of derivatives fit into this landscape and how they behave. So we have this broad bucket of things called securities. These are just tradable elements of the markets. They're broken down into a few different sub-buckets. We have equities, derivatives and debt. Debt is kind of something most of you might be familiar with, but it's access to things like bonds, notes, products that have a completely different structure than kind",

And then we have derivatives. Derivatives are really, really interesting because as you'll find out in a second, these are products whose value actually derives from other things. So things like equities and things like debt. So these are contracts that pertain to other things, which I'll explain more in a few moments. In derivatives, we have a couple big buckets like options futures. There's way more than options and futures.

If you are buying or selling stock, it's actually quite straightforward. So if we take a look at something like spy, and you buy shares of stock, you just buy shares of spy. A couple of things can happen. It can go up or it can go down pretty much it. And the way you make money or lose money is depending on if it goes up or if it goes down. Again, pretty simple. If you introduce options to this equation, there are other profit factors that now matter quite a lot. And let me grab this back so I can show you some of them. So we still care about direction a lot as options traders. It's kind of the most important thing that we have available to us. But there are these other inputs that impact our positions, things like volatility, how much something moves, that impacts the pricing of options. The time frame, things that have longer duration contracts, typically more expensive than shorter duration contracts, as time passes the value of the contract slowly decays. Interest rates can even impact options. This is less important upfront for you guys, just being completely transparent, but you should",

The time frame, things that have longer duration contracts, typically more expensive than shorter duration contracts, as time passes the value of the contract slowly decays. Interest rates can even impact options. This is less important upfront for you guys, just being completely transparent, but you should know it exists. And we'll talk more about this a little bit later. So if we're talking about trading options, and I say that I like trading options, but I just gave you a bunch of issues that options, prospectively add to our trading process than why? Why would we do this? Well, it's for a few specific payoff reasons. They are leveraged products, which means you control more money with a little bit amount of money. They have completely customizable risk and reward payoff structures. That hands down is what makes options what they are. It's why we call them strategic investments. So what does that mean? Well, if we pop over here, let's say that you bought shares of Spy. If Spy goes up by 1, you make 1 on your share. There are a completely different set of rules that apply to options. And on that 1 movement, you can make more than 1. You can also make movement, even you can also make money if it makes a movement that's slightly against your position, but not too heavily. You can also trade markets that are going up like this, that are going down like this, that",

It also gives you the ability to trade a completely different asset class called volatility, which we'll touch on that a little bit later. This gets very, very deep pretty quickly. So we'll talk about some elements of this, however, just know that there's literally an entire different asset class that you have direct exposure to when you trade options. So I keep clicking the wrong thing coming back to this. So that in a nutshell is why options become really fascinating products to trade, because they give you the ability to completely customize what you're trying to do. If you want to decrease risk, you can use options for that. If you want to increase leverage, options can do that. If you want to trade for income options can do that. But again, it adds complexity. So it's really important to know that there is a give and take relationship to using these products that require some level of understanding, which hopefully will achieve by the end of this video.

And as you guys are kind of sharing some of that with me here, we will move on to the next slide. I'm going to leave this up for a second without even talking just yet. And we'll dive into it a bit more. We'll stretch us as stocks on steroids. They could be, I get your point there, and I know that you're familiar with options to a degree. But I think the thing with options is that they can be stocks on steroids or they could be stocks, not on steroids. I think that's actually fair inversion. They literally can decrease your risk, which is important to understand with derivatives. Metal Zone says like straddles will limit your downside. They can, that's a great point.

So the one that has the tight rope, let's say there's a bunch of money there and the one with the bridge, there's less money there. That's essentially options trading. You can take the tight rope, the lower probability that you're going to make it, higher probability that you are going to fall and plummet to your death and not see that money. But if you do make it, there's a ton of money on the other side. Or you can take the much more sure bet and walk across the bridge. There's going to be less money there, but it's still there for you to grab. So I think that that is an important way to kind of think about the risk profiles available to you guys. Jay says, I've definitely thought that you need a decent bit of starting capital to trade options, also a little scary about the leverage. Yeah, so that's another great point. And there's kind of a two-sided answer to this. The first side is yes, you don't actually need a bunch of money to start, but if I were to give like a genuine answer on reasonable starting capital, the more money you have, the better off you are provided that you have good risk controls. So what I mean by that is this, if you have a ton of money and",

So what I mean by that is this, if you have a ton of money and you're a terrible trader with terrible risk controls, then there's a probability that you lose all of your money. Right? So that would be a bad scenario where more money actually is a bigger risk because you're not disciplined and you lose the money. However, trading a small amount of money is very difficult because as soon as you put on any single position, you tend to be oversized in terms of waiting within your portfolio, you can't accept as much natural movement in the underlying volatility and you essentially have really low margin for error. The other thing is you really can't trade optimize strategies. You're forced into trading things like vertical spreads and we'll talk about those a little bit later. Vertical spreads aren't the worst thing on planet earth and there are people that can trade them successfully. That I think is really important to note because my opinion of them is one thing and my experience with them is one thing, but you should know that everything that I'm talking about is literally just from my personal experience.

Metal Zones says I've always been interested in using them to trade sideways markets. Yeah, you can absolutely use straddles and strangles for that. Craig says this man loves to talk about options without understanding volatility. Potentially, I think I understand volatility pretty well, but maybe not. Joe says I've lost thousands of dollars on options that actually has happened to all of us. All of this says far too many options are glorified lottery tickets, which is actually one of the things we'll talk about in a little bit because you're absolutely right. A lot of people look to trade the cheapest option possible and that's a giant problem because just like we saw from MetalZone earlier, I bought calls once expired worthless, that's super, super common because if we're looking at a product again like spy and we take a look at the short term options that are super far out of the money, they're very, very cheap, but there's a reason why they're so cheap because the probability of them returning a positive yield is relatively low.

And we'll talk a little bit more about how to read things like the gamma and theta on the options so that you get a sense of how they'll behave as time moves or as the underlying moves, but the point being is a lot of times the cheaper the options are the bigger movement required from a buying perspective in order for them to actually return anything. So yeah, it's a really, really important point. Oh, let's see. No, you says I've always had the impression that the barrier to entry is high. Yeah, that's absolutely true. That's not wrong at all. So again, it's high in the sense that options add more complexity for sure, like we talked about before, but it's like anything else. Once you understand the rules set, it's not that, it's really not that bad. And the cool part is is that the rules will carry over over time. So the way that I think about it is imagine if you're playing a sport, the first time you play that sport, the barrier to entry is pretty high. You have to learn all the rules.

    "text": "that I think about it is imagine if you're playing a sport, the first time you play that sport, the barrier to entry is pretty high. You have to learn all the rules. You have to make sure that you're playing as best as you can within a certain rules set. And that can take a little time to get used to before you even can get to a point where you can optimize what you're doing to essentially leverage the rules set, to move even better in the correct direction, meaning there are some sports like you jitsu. There are certain rules that you can bend to benefit your playstyle. So with options, it's the same thing. You have to understand the rules and there are a lot of them up front. And there are a lot of small details in options that are tricky to pick up. But once you understand them, they're universal. They're there, they don't change. And that gives you the ability to benefit from the rules set. So there is a relatively high barrier to entry, but like learning any other skill set, once you learn the skill set, it's very, very manageable, I think. Craig says, I love talking about structures like it's strategy. Use the coverage strangle because it's the best. Not so much. So when we talk about structures and strategy, again, to be clear, right, I think it's a pedantic point in the framing there, but it's fine to highlight",

So when we talk about structures and strategy, again, to be clear, right, I think it's a pedantic point in the framing there, but it's fine to highlight it. So if we think about structure, it's literally just a combination of options. But most of the time when we're referring to structures, we're discussing them in the context strategy because very infrequently, are we talking about option structures just to talk about them? We're typically talking about them in the context of trading them, which would be strategy. So it's a fair point, but something to highlight. When somebody says the term option structure, they literally just mean the combination of whatever legs of the option that we're talking about. Strategy is the deployment of that structure, how you use that structure. So yeah, it's a fair point to bring up. And you'll hear people colloquially, typically refer to it as strategy because again, the vast majority of the time, we're not talking about the structures in a vacuum to just talk about structures. We're talking about them in the context of using them in trading, which would be strategy. Shrejie says, barriers not as high as you'd think, but it gets steep fast. That's a great way to phrase it.

Now, that's a good point, but I think as we go through this, you'll probably find that there are some general rules that you can apply so that you stay safe. And then as you gain competence, you can scope out a little bit more, a little bit more, a little bit more without putting yourself in danger. When I think about probably one of the primary issues with new traders is that they tend to get in over their skis too fast, and then they struggle massively because they're exposing themselves to risk that they don't even identify. Shrejie says, strategy is longer short-vol, thanks for confirmation that your clue is. Yeah, I mean, Jason's Craig has no chill. Yeah, well, that's kind of some internet people will be like that. But again, like saying strategy is longer short-vol, that can be a structure, right? So I can have a short straddle that is short-vol. That's still just a structure.

Like to try and draw the demarcation between structure and strategy, like you are, it is literally just to try to pick a word fight. It's not really productive for anybody. So back over to introduction to derivatives. So as we talked about before, a derivative is a product whose value is derived from something else. That's what makes it a derivative. So sometimes I like to use the deed to the to a house as an analogy. So if you think about the D to a house, it's just a piece of paper. This is an iPad, but pretend it's paper and it's not worth anything. However, that deed gives you rights to real property, a real asset. So this piece of paper starts to take on a slightly different value perspective because whoever holds the deed has rights to the property. So it's kind of a loose analogy, but the overall point behind that is that you can use options as a tool to grant yourself access or different relationships with the underlying product, which you'll see in this chart below. Options are contracts between two people. There's always a buyer and seller and this is actually one of the",

    "text": "overall point behind that is that you can use options as a tool to grant yourself access or different relationships with the underlying product, which you'll see in this chart below. Options are contracts between two people. There's always a buyer and seller and this is actually one of the cool parts about them because they differ than things like stock where stock there is a limit and amount. There is only the number of shares that exist. Options are very different. Options can be created at will. There's no rules around them provided that there's a counterparty to create the contract. Whenever that contract is started, there's two sides to every options position. There's a buyer and a seller. The vast majority of the time you as the market participant are going to be paired with a market maker. However, over time, that market maker is looking to offload their risk. So eventually, the other side of your contract can be another trader, but the vast majority of the time, it's going to be a market maker at least to open your position. Whoever buys the option, they have a right to do something. So if you buy calls or sell puts, I'm sorry, or buy puts, I got to fix this. Jay says, is this recorded by any chance? Yeah, so it'll be available on YouTube live. So, oh, I see what I was writing here. So if you buy calls, you essentially have the right to buy",

So if you buy calls, you essentially have the right to buy shares at a set price. If you buy puts, you have the right to sell shares at a set price by a specific date. And we'll talk about the details and what those actually look like. Sellers, then we receive money to fulfill the other side of this trade. So if I sell a call, then I now have the obligation to then take the other side of that trade. So we'll talk about settlement in a little bit, which is a really important element here. The main takeaway from this point is that the buyer of an option has the right to do something with that option. The seller of an option, whether it's a call or a put, is obligated to do something. So notice how I just use those terms, calls and puts. There are two kinds of options. Those are the two. Now, universally, they have some traits about them that are really useful to note. And you can take a look at that here. So calls grant the buyer the right to buy shares. Calls grant, I'm sorry, long puts grant the buyer the right to sell shares, which is what we talked about up",

I purposely use these different terms in here because you'll hear traders refer to all of them, but they do have different meanings, kind of like what Craig was talking about before, like structures and strategy. They get colloquially mashed up. And it's the same thing with buying, being long, or having a debit to open a position. So in that sense, you'll find a lot of terminology has tons of different meanings. Craig says it's productive to have a baseline understanding of trading options and not mistake in an option structure. Is having an edge. Again, I think you're kind of taking something multiple steps beyond what I said. And it's actually a great point because a structure has no edge. And there's no point in the video that I said a structure has an edge. But it's kind of clear that you're just looking to talk just to talk. So you're doing great, though, by the way.

Yeah, it's all good, dude. It's honestly, we can kick Craig out whenever we want. I try not to do that, right? Like the overall goal is to give people an opportunity to interact like people. But you can tell from the chat so far that he just wants to argue a little bit, which is you could tell I like arguing. So I'm okay with it. Provided that he can stay respectful. I don't really care. J Kim says, if you're selling to open, who did you borrow the option from? Great question. So if you're selling to open, you don't have to borrow anything. And that is a fantastic point. You simply are starting a new contract. So remember when we were talking about the correlation between options and shares of stock, shares have a finite number and they have to be borrowed if you sell to open.

    "text": "is a fantastic point. You simply are starting a new contract. So remember when we were talking about the correlation between options and shares of stock, shares have a finite number and they have to be borrowed if you sell to open. With options, it's completely different. You literally enter a agreement with somebody else and you can create those agreements at will. So technically speaking, there's no borrowing at the point of selling an option. You're creating a new contract taking the short side of it. Let me know if that makes sense. Craig says selling a course on options, which he doesn't understand. Let's also again, could you show me the course that I have? Because I don't, but. Actually, I think we're. Think we're about here. We'll put you on time out, actually. We'll just give you like a couple minutes. We'll give you like a five minutes to see if you're able to. Get yourself together. It's actually hilarious that you can time out somebody on a YouTube live. And it literally feels like I'm doing that to a child. It's my favorite thing. The fact that there's a grown human being that just got put in time out. That's hilarious. Okay, cool. So Jay's following along. That's perfect. Yeah, that's one of the fascinating points about options actually is they maintain that capability. That they can be created at will.

So if the underlying, which is another term for stock, I use stock here because most people know what a stock is, but I'll use underlying interchangeably because it's not always a stock. Again, it's another pedantic point like our friend Craig probably would want to argue about. But materially, it doesn't make a absolute difference at all other than knowing the difference, which is important. But for a beginner perspective, you can insert stock underlying. It's all the same context here. The reason why we differentiate between them, those because again, if we go back here, you realize that stock is a type of equity. However, you can trade options on ETFs. You can trade them on bonds notes, other kinds of products. So that's the difference here. So when we take a look at when the underlying price moves, so just saying that the underlying goes up or the underlying goes down, the underlying goes up calls will always appreciate and value across the board. All of them will. And if the underlying goes down calls across the board will depreciate. They'll go down",

The puts you'll notice there are the inverse as the underlying goes up puts become less expensive. They depreciate. And as the underlying goes down puts become more expensive. They appreciate. An interesting part with options that kind of makes them a little easier on the volatility side of things is that volatility impacts the premium of options generally is the same. Again, there's always slight nuances. Once you get into the practical applications of things, but if volatility goes up both call and put premium goes up. If volatility goes down both call and put premium goes down. So when I'm referring to premium in this sense, you'll notice that options contracts have a handful of very specific components. And in this case, one of those components is premium that's simply the value of the option. So when we look at the price of a stock that share price, that's the value of the stock options have their own value. And the reason being is because that contract gives people the right to do something or the obligation to do something. And there's a price associated with that.

So there's somebody that can essentially trade the right to purchase a property and there's a premium associated with that right. It's kind of the same thing here. So the other components of a contract or whatever underlying we're referring to. So a example of this is this all of these options in here listed in this chain, which will become more familiar with in a little bit. All of them only pertain to spy, which is the underlying. This is an ETF in this case. All of these pertain only to spy. So that's the underlying component. Days to expiration is how long is this agreement good for the reason why this matters is imagine you and I were to make a bet.

    "text": "the bet was that the weather tomorrow, I live in San Diego and today it was kind of cloudy. Maybe I forgot what the high was maybe like high 60s. And if I were to make a bet that in the future, the weather is going to be also 68 degrees. If I were to make that bet in the short term, we kind of know what the probability of it being 60 degrees pretty high. But if that bet was for a really long time and the wager was if at some point we need to be higher than 68 degrees. Where is it more probable that the temperature will be higher than 68 degrees within one day or within 360 days over the course of the year. Probably over the course of the year. So when we're looking at stuff like this, it's important to understand that the time component to options increase the premium. The longer the days to expiration, the DTE, the more expensive options will be. The strike price, this is super important because when we talk about the right to buy shares or the this the right to sell shares or the obligation to buy or the obligation to sell. In this case, this is what price are we talking about? Where do we buy the shares at? What price you do it at the strike price. So again, it's kind of like using the D to the house and on the D to",

Whatever you the seller and the counterparty, the buyer or vice versa are agreeing to look at. So let's take a look at some of these traits in this section. So if we look across all these different explorations, that's what these are. And if we look into one of them, you'll notice on the left hand side here, it's kind of small, but you should be able to see it. This is calls and then this over here says puts. Then down the center, we have just a reminder of the expiration. It's just a repeat of what's up here. And in this case, this represents 42 DTE days to expiration. Then you'll notice we have the strike price down the center. So all of this is relative to whether it's a call or put. That's why the strike is in the center.

It's just an example of some other piece of a transaction that has a relationship to an asset. But bigger concepts like that might be hard to grasp if you're too focused on, you know, pedantically arguing moot points. All right, let's get caught up on the question. So, notice this, have you ever had an in the money call with no liquidity? What do you mean by liquidity? Because just about any single position will have liquidity, it's just a matter at what cost. So, when we're trading options, we care about having more liquidity. A smotus says no buyer. Very infrequent. It could happen, technically speaking.

Yeah, so maybe if we look in something, this is way less liquid. We could look at like QLD. So, this is a really good example. So, looking at the 69 giga-d strike price in QLD out in 16 Jan, which is 588 days to expiration, really long term, that's called a leaps option. You can see that right here, the OI is zero and it has no volume. Nobody's transacted here. However, you can still see there's a market, super wide, but there's still a market. So, the point being is the mandate for a market maker is to provide a market. However, again, they can quote something that's 69 strike, that's super far out in time, which will widen the bit-ask spread. But nonetheless, it's 4 wide, there's still a market here. So, the vast majority of instances, you will have liquidity. It's just not always good liquidity. So, Samota, that's the kind of long, more exploratory answer to your question. Let's see. Jay says, do calls and puts appreciate with higher volatility because there's more demand for options for hedging? That's definitely part of it. But",

    "text": "instances, you will have liquidity. It's just not always good liquidity. So, Samota, that's the kind of long, more exploratory answer to your question. Let's see. Jay says, do calls and puts appreciate with higher volatility because there's more demand for options for hedging? That's definitely part of it. But the main reason why higher volatility impacts the premium for options is because when we're talking about volatility in the context of the underlying, all that is an expectation of movement. That's all volatility means it's literally movement and it's variance. So, if we take a look at something that has a higher expected movement, as compared to something that has a smaller expected movement, from both the buying and selling perspective of that trade, when there's more volatility, more expected movement, there's higher risk potential, but also higher reward potential. So, if you buy a call that has massive expected movement like GameStop right now, if you look at something like GameStop compared to something else of a relative price, the volatility right now in GameStop is very, very high on a relative basis. And that's because it's moving so much. So, if you buy a call, your potential benefit is very high if it moves in your favor. If you sold that call, your potential risk is massive because if it does get one of these giant moves and you sold a call that's going to hurt your position a lot. So, that's why volatility has that kind",

So, that's why volatility has that kind of unilateral impact in general for premium of options. It's a good question. Craig says, use rent to own that actually is a strike price for the home. I agree with you. I think that's a good one provided that there's an existing contract for it. But yeah, I think that's a good example. Rudy says, would you say that it's best for a beginner to day trade options or trade options that will take days in the long run, not sure if I'm making sense? No, that's making a ton of sense. That's okay. So, I think the real answer to that question, which is really unsexy, but it's the genuine. I think the best way for new options traders to trade options is to paper trade them. The reason why I say that, and that's using fake money essentially, the reason why I say that is because we talked about this idea of complexity. And the first time I played rugby, I didn't know that you can't run behind somebody, right? You have to run forward. That messed me up.

So, the first time I got the ball in my very first real rugby game, I ran behind somebody. And obviously, you were to give the ball up because I committed a penalty. I didn't know all of the rules. And I made a giant mistake on the first one. And to be honest, I actually knew that rule, but my instincts kicked in. And I just made the wrong decision in terms of where I was running. So, it's similar to options where there's a lot of little rules that can be very tricky. And the fact of the matter is the probability of a brand new option trader taking a tiny amount of money and then turning it into a giant sum of money is so low. It's so low. So, I bring that up because there's really little benefit for an options trader to immediately start trading options with real money as compared to the all likelihood of them drastically scaling down their account, drawing down their account, which is way more difficult for them to build up over time. Because as you guys know, as the percent decline builds, the percent required to get back to break even expands. That's volatility decay.

That volatility variance in their PL actually serves as drag on the returns. There's a lot of really good research on that exact principle that I think is kind of worth for people to be aware of. It's called Shannon's Demon. And it talks about how minimizing variance can actually increase returns without increasing top line returns. It's one of the primary approaches that I've taken to trading. All right. So, I want to take a pause on this slide and see if you guys have any question. Okay, Rudy has one.

So, I can enter an exit trade you see where it says these are simulated trades. You can essentially place trades in here and see how they do. Now, this is back in time. So, if you want to actually paper trade today right now with something like think or swim, they have that ability. You essentially tick it when you're logging into the platform. And it's just a fake account. Now, that's what TD, well, I guess not TD Ameritrade anymore. Schwab. It's what Schwab offers. Other brokers will have paper trading available. I think one of the best things you could do to paper trade though is literally do it in a Google Sheet or Excel. And the reason why that's really useful is because you maintain the data set. You keep the data. And that's a giant mistake. I made as a new trader when I was paper trading here and there. And I didn't do a great job at it. I would approach that very differently if I were to do it again. But one of the main things is every time you reset the account, all the data is gone. And that's kind of just a waste of time and effort beyond what you can remember. So doing your best to paper",

So doing your best to paper trade upfront, track what you're doing so that you can revisit how things behave is super, super useful. Alex says ES is correct. I jumped into options years ago and lost money without even realizing why. And more importantly, I didn't know what questions to ask. For example, stock goes up, option goes down exactly. That's such a great point. And I'm glad that you shared that experience because we've literally all been there before where the underlying goes in your favor, but you're not making money and you don't know why it's a giant problem. And doing that with real money, it just doesn't help you out that much. Now, I want to be really clear. This concept of paper trading is really useful. However, paper trading will never fully replicate live trading. So you can't only paper trade, but I think it's great to paper trade upfront, get all those mistakes out of the way and then move on. Yes, still doesn't know why. Yeah, maybe sometimes the markets do really screwy things.

If not, I mean, we can just kick you off. We'll give you a chance, though. We'll see. We'll see if you could pull it together there, buddy. So any other questions on the introduction to derivatives, kind of what calls are, what puts are, what the prospect of opening a position looks like. Another thing I didn't mention before that's worth mentioning in case it's not semi-intuitive is the inverse of this. This is how you close the positions. So if we bought to open a position, the way you close that position is you sell to close. And if you sold to open, the inverse to that position is by close, just the inverse. Cool. So I think we're good here so far. This is just an option chain, which we talked a little bit about before. Paul says, how do you keep track of vol can you charge for that? Yeah, definitely. So there's volatility that exists in a lot of different states. So if we come, let's use like a normal ticker like spy and you can go into the options",

So if we come, let's use like a normal ticker like spy and you can go into the options chain. First thing you can do is take a look at the volatility relative to all these different explorations. So when we think about volatility in trading, there are a few different levels that apply. So we can have the volatility for an individual expiration cycle. We can have the volatility for individual options. So in this case, if we come in here, that's what this column is. I have a lot of stuff. So it's kind of difficult to see. But this percentage is implied volatility. Then if we go down to the underlying itself, it will also have volatility. So the way that you can track it is a few different methods. The easiest one is if your broker has a tool to show you volatility. So you can essentially see how it behaves over time like this. Or you can create plots like this. But this is at the equity level. This is at the stock level. This is what the volatility looks like. And there are different kinds of volatility, which we actually have a section on that in a little bit.

    "text": "at the equity level. This is at the stock level. This is what the volatility looks like. And there are different kinds of volatility, which we actually have a section on that in a little bit. But when we're talking about options, more often than not we're using implied volatility. But then there's also historic volatility. There's different kinds of realized volatility. There's future realized. There's realized that's historic. So there's bunches of volatility, technically speaking, but from a beginner perspective, the important ones are implied and historic. Or cast matters, which we'll touch on. But it doesn't matter as much in the short term timeframe. Polo says, what is the mathematical definition of volatility? Yeah. So the way to think about volatility in a nutshell, it literally is just variance. It's how much something moves. So if something is very volatile. So again, if we look at the volatility of spy, the implied volatility of it is 12.83. And you can see how much it moves. I have a couple different metrics for that. We'll use the 12 day average true range in this case. The 12 day ATR is 1. You don't have to know exactly what all those details mean. Just know that spy, which the implied volatility is 12.83. Its ATR is 1. Then if we go to GameStop, its volatility is 253. And its 12 day ATR is 25. So what this is highlighting is the higher the implied volatility is for something, literally the",

So historic volatility is literally just the stock price. How much it moves? You can track it in different time frames. That's what these white lines here are. Our historic volatility. So implied volatility is looking forward. Historic volatility is what happened in the past. Middle zone is, okay, that's what I was missing and just let them expire. It was confusing me that when I tried to close them, it was wanting me to sell the calls. Yeah, exactly. So when you want to close an options position, you essentially have to inverse whatever you did to open it. Alex says, volatility math is dispersion of data around the mean or over a period of time, variance is the difference from the mean. Yeah, it's obviously even better than I can colloquially explain it. That's really good grab from investor media.

So if we come in here, which is actually pretty cool, you can look at this tool and actually let me get something that's not squarely something that's normal. We'll use spy. So notice this is called a probability cone and this essentially is taking the volatility for the underlying itself across the various explorations and it's giving you the probability in this case of a one standard deviation move plus or minus.

Jay says, so it's kind of like standard deviation with time. Yeah, so you can annualize volatility. That's typically what we would do. So when we're talking about volatility in this context down here, the implied volatility for the underlying itself, that's the annualized standard deviations of volatility of movement. And when you're looking at volatility, however, you can break it down into smaller time frames that doesn't have to be annualized. So in this case, you can see that the, let's call it the 10 June expiration is 6.83 implied volatility. So this is relative to this time frame. That's one of the cool parts about options is you can use it to come up with inferences on where price movements might be based on how the market is pricing options. So that is a great, a great point. All right, let's get back to this. So let's take a look now at the mononess and the premium of an option. I want to break this down a little bit more. The reason why is because the premium of an option has kind of two big components. It has intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic reflects how far",

    "text": "let's take a look now at the mononess and the premium of an option. I want to break this down a little bit more. The reason why is because the premium of an option has kind of two big components. It has intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic reflects how far in the money it is. Extrinsic value represents how much time is left in the options, which includes a volatility input. The reason why it's important to understand the difference between these two is because of the way that they behave. So first, let's start with mononess. And this is kind of one of those rules that you just have to accept. And then over time, it'll be more natural. So we'll start with the call side of the equation. Notice kind of this shaded area. And then there's this black area. The shaded area represents in the money. The black area represents out of the money. That's on the call side. And then if you look at the put side, notice how it's essentially inverted. They're catty-quartered to one another. So the black side on the put side represents out of the money. And then the shaded area represents in the money. Okay, so what does that actually mean? Is there any brave souls that want to take a guess at how you determine if an option is in the money or not based on what you see here? And I can even close back into this. As a",

Is there any brave souls that want to take a guess at how you determine if an option is in the money or not based on what you see here? And I can even close back into this. As a hint, I want you to look at where the underlying the last price was. So the underlying the last price in spy was 534. So what do you notice? Joe says price. Yep. There you go. That's exactly right. So what about price? How do we use price to infer if we are in the money or not? Well, no, you says where the underlying is relative to the strike price. That's exactly right. And then Pat says price is higher. Exactly. Correct. Jay says in the money when the underlying is greater than the strike, exactly. Correct. Nice shop. Literally all you got it 100 correct. That's for the call side. So whenever you have an option that the strike price is less than the current price that's in the money. That means it has intrinsic value. If it's out of the money, it means it has no intrinsic value. And this is all extrinsic value, which is composed of time and volatility. So as we add more time, the more extrinsic value we have, as we add more volatility or expected movement, premiums will also go up for out of the money options and in the money options.",

It's good to see you. Craig says just pedantics and well that's not the correct way to use that term which is pedantic. But yeah, it's in that case and as I said it's exactly as Joe said he's not wrong at all. But from my experience with people with options that if we start including the long or short aspect of moneyness it just unnecessarily can found things right because at the simplest form it doesn't matter if the option was long short doesn't matter at all it has everything to do with strike relative to underlying.

Craig says you explain things really well. Well done. Thank you very much. Yeah, I actually try to help people which I know is kind of a different form than popping in a live on Friday which is actually hilarious that your goal there was just to kind of try to troll. But yeah, I appreciate that compliment because I do try to help people. It's an important thing to me. I had a lot of help along my path. So I think finding people and working with people and trying to share that with others is actually super, super important. Jay says for extrinsic value, are you saying that volatility is part of the calculation for time value? Yeah. So volatility is part of the calculation for extrinsic value. So it's we want to make sure that we differentiate those two values from one another because you can discreetly isolate time value. It's quite literally just the duration until expiration.

We know that at all given points. Volatility in order to figure out what volatility is sophisticated traders and investors, typically market makers, institutions, they have volatility forecasts. So this typically is done via a surface model that they maintain. They use different pricing rules. They use recent price data to then project what they think volatility is going to be going forward. Then price discovery occurs where different people essentially puts in put in their bids on what they think volatility is going to be, which eventually normalizes and stabilizes price. Then we would take implied volatility out of that. And that's how we can see what the volatility input is.

The problem is it starts to lose a little bit of nuance in different positions like covered calls and stuff like that where you actually might want to sell intrinsic, which is slightly different style, but you can use that for like a dividend capture strategy. But yeah, I think in general, that's a completely fair place to start. Ian says do you use options in core allocation or speculative? I use it across the entire portfolio. So my trading portfolio is all options like my primary margin account is all options positions. Now I do have equity that comes in and out as part of my options strategies, but in general, it's options positions and then a hold equities as part of a broader strategy that I'm running. Cool. So now we should be able to identify if an option is in the money or out of the money, and if we know if it's in the money or out of the money, we also know what the premium of that option includes.

Now the reason why this matters so much is when we think about the impacts of various market forces on the premium of an option, you'll see how important this becomes. And we actually get a first glimpse of that through the Greeks. Now for those that are interested, I have a video that goes super deep in depth on the Greeks. And for those that are curious, you can grab a screenshot from this, which essentially is just a reference guide for the various Greeks that we have. Craig says dividend capture strategies with someone that doesn't know what they're talking about what suggests selling vol is a bet on vol not trying to capture some made up dividend. Yeah, I mean, honestly, the more I hear you talk, the more I understand that you're one of those people that really think you know what you're talking about, but you actually don't. It's fascinating because that's like the most unique psyche to come across. But dividend, I again, didn't say that selling the call in a different capture strategy is predicated on vol or talking about extrinsic value. I feel like maybe you struggle to like maintain pace with like base conversation. So just general tip is to we have two two ears in one mouth, I guess two hands. So that might",

So just general tip is to we have two two ears in one mouth, I guess two hands. So that might be why you're typing so much, but use the proverbial mouth, right? So spend more time listening and trying to digest this compared to thinking about what you're going to say because a lot of what you're saying is, it's just nonsense, which is quite entertaining to me actually as I look at it. But great great ad, I guess. So going back to the Greeks to get us back on track after a little bit of comedic relief, we can take a look at what the primary Greeks are, which actually consist of first order Greeks and one second order Greek. And if you look at this graph, it actually shows that there's even more and there are more Greeks beyond this. But from a retail trading perspective, you can care about things like charm, vanna, vulgar, like those will come up. But the vast majority of cases, you really don't have to worry so much about this because the vast majority of what you'll derive the benefit from is delta theta, Vega, gamma and row. Notice how gamma is a second order Greek. So how can you tell if it's first order or second order? Well, let's take",

So if we take a look at delta, it's the premium rate of change, beta, premium rate of change, Vega premium rate of change, row premium rate of change. What do you notice about all of these? What these four are measuring are how premium changes with respect to another variable. So delta measures premium rate of change per one point move in the underlying price. Something like theta gives us rate of change for the passage of time. Vega for movements in volatility. And then row per movement in the risk free rate, which is kind of variable depending on the duration of the option that you're trading. However, when let me see, we're looking at the Greeks.

Better accurate, right? So the problem is is when you say things that you don't know anything about, but it's objectively wrong. You really lose credibility as a troll. So I think something that would be really useful to you is to kind of work on your skill set a little bit. But he says there's a lot of skills in this base. I don't blame anyone expecting that.

So I don't know the specific section that you're reading. So again, I wouldn't want to give you guys bomb scoop.

So more often than not, I'm going to try to follow the trend as best as I can. So I think that using call order imbalances as a contrarian signal could be the sus, but we'd have to take a look at it more closely. I don't have a discrete answer for you. It's a good question, though. It's one that actually has me interested. Let's take a look at some of the simple ones here. So this one says if you trade volatility and how you do it, I absolutely do trade volatility. So here, I'm going to share a video with you guys that outlines kind of the primary approach that I take, which is attempting to trade variance risk premium. So risk premium in options is the tendency for implied volatility to remain higher and overstated relative to realized volatility. That's all. So if we go out super, super far, notice these yellow lines which represent implied volatility and these white lines which represent historic volatility. Notice how in general, the yellow line trends above the white line. That means in general, implied volatility is pricing in larger moves than we actually see. Now",

    "text": "we go out super, super far, notice these yellow lines which represent implied volatility and these white lines which represent historic volatility. Notice how in general, the yellow line trends above the white line. That means in general, implied volatility is pricing in larger moves than we actually see. Now you'll notice every once in a while short term moves will absolutely exceed the implied volatility. So that's why we tend to have overstated implied volatility to a degree is because of the distribution of stock prices, which is not log normal. So one of the traits is in option pricing that we tend to see implied volatility priced more richly than the realized moves would otherwise necessitate a perfect system. Now there's a bunch of reasons why this exists, but it comes down to supply and demand. That's what leads to the ultimate pricing of options is there need to be people willing to transact at an agreeable price, both seller and buyer perspective. So when we're looking at trends in volatility, that's one of the easiest ways to trade it. Now the other ways that I like to trade volatility are through things like trading earnings. That's a great one. FOMC rate statements is another really effective. Now this is all from a short volatility perspective. The reason why my personal approach to trading volatility by itself more often than not is predicated from the short perspective is another trait of volatility is that it tends to be",

Clustering means that it tends to hover around where it's recently been until it goes through a transitory phase which it will then cluster again. Craig says sounds like all of you in strategies. I mean, they're just really basic volatility strategies, but yeah, absolutely. I think one of the best things that you and talks about is like the risk reversal. His structure to a risk reversal is fantastic. And the way that he employs the delta bands, that's I think fantastic. The risk reversal, I think from a retail perspective, is really difficult to put on in a cost efficient way.

So yeah, Paul says, what is VRP variance risk premium? So VRP or risk premium, there's different kinds of risk premium, variance risk premium specifically relates to this phenomenon that I was just telling you about where implied volatility trends over historic volatility. Good question. Cool. Greg says, only reason I've been kicked out because I've 3 of your audience, it does not show that you read into it. No, it's because I don't care, right? If you were actually bothering me, I take you out in a heartbeat. I don't really care. But I also think it's important to at least try to show people like you love because it's very clear that you don't get it in your life. If this is how you behave. And again, if this is your agenda for a Friday night. So we try to be nice to people like you against your best wishes. Paul says, you have IVs for different periods. How do you use this? It's another great question. So depending on how you're structuring trades, you can look at implied volatility in different perspectives. When you think about implied volatility as compared to a theoretical model like the Black Shoals Martin model, volatility is not uniform. There's actually what we call a volatility surface.",

When you think about implied volatility as compared to a theoretical model like the Black Shoals Martin model, volatility is not uniform. There's actually what we call a volatility surface. And it's a three-dimensional view of volatility because as you go across different explorations at different strike prices, they all will have different volatilities. So you can trade these different relationships between volatility. It's actually really, really cool when you get a deeper relationship with volatility because it's one of the more tradable asset classes. And it's because it has more predictive qualities than price can have, again, depending on the time frame that you're looking at. So that's essentially how you can use the various IVs. It looks like we got a timeout. Craig, again, there we go. We're going to have to expand your time out this time, little buddy. Off you go. So that's essentially how I use it. It allows me to trade the relationship of different volatilities. That's the punchline. So that's kind of like in a nutshell of the way that I trade volatility. Now a couple notes is trading volatility is kind of tricky because it's very path dependent. And if you really want to gain direct exposure to volatility, you have to do things like gamma hedge, which is time intensive, or you can kind of have a looser relationship with volatility",

And that's kind of my general approach to it. I also trade volatility on zero DTEs. That's the primary source of profitability for that trade. And that still exists to a pretty significant degree. So going over actually this is a great segue to know you how to trade options around events such as earnings or economic data releases. Great question. So actually that video that I just dropped in will talk about that more in depth. But let's take a look at some examples. If we look at something like Tesla. And we take a look at how it behaves around earnings. This might be a slightly overwhelming chart. But if you take a look, you'll notice up here, we have the underlying price pre and post earnings. Then we have the implied versus historic volatility pre and post release. So essentially, there are a couple really common traits with respect to option prices around earnings. Starting about two weeks out, there will be an expansion in volatility, although it can be masked by underlying price movements, other market factors. It's not as simple as two weeks out",

Starting about two weeks out, there will be an expansion in volatility, although it can be masked by underlying price movements, other market factors. It's not as simple as two weeks out while those up. But that is the general trait starting two weeks out into an earnings release. So you can trade that volatility expansion via something like a long straddle is completely reasonable. Then as you get closer to the release, there tends to be a rapid contraction of volatility post release. So to capture the contraction post release, we would sell volatility via short straddles, short strangles before the release. And then we would look to close it after the release, after the volatility contracts. And this is a great example of that movement. So if we look at implied volatility before the release, in this case, it is 72.55. And then after the release, it drops to 66.43. So in this example, selling volatility would make money. There are examples, however, where selling volatility doesn't make money. And the movement post earnings is bigger than the implied move. This is an example of that. So notice how before this earnings release, implied volatility was 62.91. And historical volatility here was 58 leading into the release. And then post release, they literally flip. And historical volatility jumps up to 57.77. implied down to 53. This is where short volatility",

    "text": "This is an example of that. So notice how before this earnings release, implied volatility was 62.91. And historical volatility here was 58 leading into the release. And then post release, they literally flip. And historical volatility jumps up to 57.77. implied down to 53. This is where short volatility strategies would lose money. It's not free money. You're taking a risk. But in general, you'll notice that in most of these instances, implied volatility trends over historical volatility through the earnings release. So the punchline is if you're trading earnings releases and trying to trade volatility around it, it's very, very much predicated on it being a numbers game. You have to get enough cycles in because you'll have instances where you lose like this right here. You would have lost as well. implied volatility contracted, but realized volatility expanded more. And in this case, you lose your capital. So we can take a look at this in different time frames to see essentially how it behaved leading directly into the release and post release. Paul says, are those candles daily? That's what the previous one was. And then this would be intraday post the release. So that's kind of the nutshell about trading earnings with volatility plays. You can trade things thinking about the difference between straddles and strangles. Strangles are less of a pure volatility play. And they are more of they have a directional component to it because the thing is if we take a look,",

Strangles are less of a pure volatility play. And they are more of they have a directional component to it because the thing is if we take a look, let's use on demand. Let's take a look at one of these examples. Let's look at first. The last earnings release would have been a good example of a losing position. And then the one before that would have been a slight win. The one before that a better win. So go back to last earnings and then two earnings ago. I just have to grab the dates. So the last earnings was 23 April after the close. I'm just going to throw it on the chat so I can find it 23 April PM. And then over here, this would have been a losing position. This one is well. Let's take a look. This one was 18 oct. PM. Oops. In the wrong spot. 18 oct PM. Jay says, is there such thing as good strategies for beginners to practice in paper trading? Absolutely. I think in paper trading, you can start with the absolute basics. Long calls, long puts, short calls, short puts. Those are all very, very reasonable initial strategies.

And that goes through a lot of the basic structures that you can trade. Now for me personally, the things I would look at would be the coverage strangle, which is very similar to what you would hear as the wheel and as some slight nuances. And then the others would be ratio diagonals. I think those are probably the primary strategies that I would trade and they're mostly directional in nature. Trading volatility is completely doable, but especially if you're trading a smaller account, there's a lot of nuance to it that becomes difficult to manage. So what that means is in order to trade volatility from a pure perspective, you don't want to trade it via iron condors or via defined risk strategies because then you're buying the exact thing you're saying is overpriced. That's why we would be selling volatility. So you start to sacrifice a lot of your edge perspective there because of that. So I think that's essentially where I would start.

And we can talk about a couple of those in just a second. I just realized we're already at 630. So I'm going to skip going through the rest of the earnings thing. It's in that video mostly that I shared up above and then I want to make sure we can get to this last question. So Scott says, can you cover your analysis for entry and then sizing, strike liquidity and scaling for option scalping opportunities? I was curious is your approach for I for scalping utilizing optimized premium pricing for launch positions? So unfortunately, and I kind of put this in the reply, I don't really scalp options that much. The reason being is again options are really nefarious in that even if you have no upfront commissions, they're extremely misleading because you can think it's way cheaper than it actually is. And it kind of starts to eat away at your profits massively. So even when I'm trading zero DTE options, I'm not considering that scalping because I'm establishing a position looking to manage it delta hedging slightly, but I carry the position",

So even when I'm trading zero DTE options, I'm not considering that scalping because I'm establishing a position looking to manage it delta hedging slightly, but I carry the position all the way through. I think if I were to look to scalp options, liquidity would be probably the hands down most important factor because without effective liquidity, you have you're you're giving up any potential as you have via friction. So when it comes to strike prices, that kind of goes into this bigger question on selecting a strike, which is completely relative to the strategy that you're trading. So sizing for scalping would have to be relative to the way that I'm expecting the price to move because you have to be positively expectant. So if we come into something like Tesla and you're trying to trade this thing intraday and let's say you're using options. Well, your options are decaying as you're holding them. Let's say that you're buying those options. You need the price movement to be big enough to cover the cost of slippage, which is the bid-ask spread. You need to cover your theta decay depending on if it's just a day. It may not be too much, but you still have to cover that cost. And you also need to overwhelm commissions.

And you just have to use something like expected returns, which I have a video on. I'll grab that for you. Here you go. So this video goes up or goes through expected returns and essentially how to think about them. The the point being is you can't just essentially try to scalp on the system of if I'm up.

If I'm down, I'm going to get out or if I'm up by a percent, I'm going to get out because you have to make sure that it makes sense against your fees and whatever your loss management protocols are.

This idea of buying calls that expire worthless because this happens literally all of the time. So when we look at what retail traders tend to do is they want to be cheap because they tend to have smaller accounts. So if we take a look at options in something like Tesla, if we're closer in time, let's use like a week out, and we look at something like a 30 delta, which is here, these calls are trading for 233. If we go further out in time to 70 days to expiration, again, to a 30 delta, these are trading for 747, something like that. So the point is the further out in time you go, the more time your contract has to work in your favor, but the more expensive it is.

The answer, however, on how to think about overcoming this is by going further out in time, and by going deeper in the money. You don't have to go super deep in the money. You can go essentially right at the money or slightly in the money. Extrinsic value will be very high. However, there's a much better probability of the underlying moving in your required direction and actually increasing the overall profitability in the position because your gamma would ramp pretty quick, but there's a higher outlay upfront. Why not says better to scalp with shares? I think that's fair. I think the only downside to that is you lose the leverage, but if you wanted to scalp, I think with shares is probably a better approach. I agree with you. Rudy says, if I check on Robinhood and click on options, it gives me a break even amount. Does that mean that all of those that all of those got covered, all those extra costs that you were talking about? I don't know if Robinhood includes fees, but what that is talking about in terms of the break even price is for different basic structures. You can calculate where the break even price is",

    "text": "those that all of those got covered, all those extra costs that you were talking about? I don't know if Robinhood includes fees, but what that is talking about in terms of the break even price is for different basic structures. You can calculate where the break even price is at expiration, which is another really commonly misunderstood concept. So for example, if we go out here to 16 August and we look at buying one of these at the money calls, just for an example, and we analyze this trade. Get rid of this. So notice how there's two lines in this risk profile. The X-axis here represents the strike price and the underlying price is right now in the center. So the X-axis here, I'm sorry, I said strike price. I didn't mean that. The underlying or the X-axis here represents the underlying price. And you can look at different strike prices further out in time, but the center point right here is the current price. And then the Y-axis is a PNL graph. As you go up, makes money, go down, lose money. So you'll notice there's these two different lines. There's purple and then there's blue. Purple represents today right now. Blue represents at expiration. So notice on this 180 call, your break even price will be the strike price loss. The debit you paid to open the position. And you can see that represented right here. It's at 195 and change, 195 90. So that's",

So a lot of people confuse that and they think that in order to make money on this trade, the underlying has to be above that. You actually start making money way earlier. Notice how this purple line shows us making money as soon as it moves in our favor. Remember, the break even price is that we typically refer to when we're looking at structures is relative to expiration. But you can make money before expiration. And that reminds me, we didn't talk about settlement, which is really, really important. I want to highlight that quickly. There are different ways you can close in options contract. The most efficacious in general is simply trading the contract. So if you buy call, it would be to sell the call. If you sell a put, it would be to buy the put back. You can also exercise options if you're a buyer. But there are a lot of caveats to that because you give up all of the extrinsic value left in the option that you're holding that you otherwise could capture by selling the option or trading the option.

I didn't want to forget that because I realized I forgot to add that earlier and I don't want to, I don't want you guys to not at least have a rudimentary understanding of settlement, which reminds me I need to add a placeholder for that little presentation that I give on settlement. And we'll add that here. But yeah, just definitely take note that we want options settlement. We typically want to trade the options. That's going to be a simpler way to manage the transaction that is lower friction for you. And the other thing I'm actually surprised nobody asked, maybe you guys already know, but is the multiplier. So you'll notice that when we're looking at these different contracts that we're quoting this as, you know, 15.70. But you notice here, it says 100. That's because the multiplier for options contracts, we would call a one lot per one lot is 100 shares. So each one of these contracts represents up to 100 shares of the underlying.

So when we're looking at the prices, you'll see that this is quoted as 15.80 at the midpoint. However, you have to multiply that by 100 to get the actual price because this is per share. These move in 100 share lots. It's an important admin note on the prices that you see here. Alex says just to make sure I understood, you are short, vol on zero DTE and delta hedge and cash secure the difference. I don't follow your question on the cash securing the difference. The way that I delta hedge, because typically when I'm trading zero DTE options, I am trading the prevalence of variance risk premium. And the way that I delta hedge is by moving the options, you can delta hedge more purely via gamma scalping. However, once you neutralize your gamma, then you have to neutralize your delta's and the easiest way to do that is through the underlying market. But SPX is typically what I trade zero DTE's in. It's in index itself. It doesn't trade in any shares. So if you grab SPX, notice how there's no size, there's no volume. So you would have to delta hedge with SPI, which is kind of a dirty hedge, we would call it. It's not a pure hedge. So the vast majority of the time when",

It's not a pure hedge. So the vast majority of the time when it comes to zero DTE's and something like SPX, I'm going to size the position very carefully. But the way that I delta hedge is by rebalancing my delta's on the long or on the short call and short put side. So slightly different. There's no real cash secure on the position. It's just a margin required product because the way that SPX options are settled is via cash. There are two different kinds of standard options contracts. There is American and European. For American options, they can be settled or they can be exercised at any point. And European options can only be exercised at expiration. But then we can also have if something is cash settled or settled with the underlying. So SPX is an example of a European style option where it can only be exercised at expiration and it's cash settled. There's no shares that move. So if, for example, I sell an option and it's in the money and it's exercised, it just settles to cash. There's no underlying that moves around. Good question though. All right, gang.
