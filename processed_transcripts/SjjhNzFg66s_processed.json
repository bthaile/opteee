    "text": "Paul tutor Jones is betting big on djt winning the election I actually got an email from somebody asking if I could take a look at djt and I'm always happy to take a peek at whatever you want me to that's kind of a a fun game of analyzing what you're interested in so I started looking through at a broad sense and there's a few things that I think we should talk about but this piece of news I actually think is kind of a a big component here now to be abundantly clear I really couldn't possibly care less about anybody's itical leanings my entire premise of that is you should do whatever is right for you now there is a reality though behind election impacts on the stock market and that is the lens I aim to talk about this through right now Camala Harris doesn't really have an ETF or a ticker that's largely associated with her and her brand like djt and Donald Trump has so that's why this is part of the conversation here if Cala did I would talk about that one as well but she does as it sits there are different ideas for whether or not a republican wins or a Democrat wins in terms of what's likely to move in terms of sectors but those are more just generalized less precise tools this is a really interesting scenario that quite literally there is a stock that is directly tied",
