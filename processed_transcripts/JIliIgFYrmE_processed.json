We're going to talk about the market as a whole super fast Then I want to talk about DJT and then I want to talk about GameStop because we had some news pop today That's actually pretty cool. So from a broad market perspective We saw a little bit of downturn today the interesting part about this downturn is that it's mixed with in the sectors from within the SP 500 this simply means that it's not like this Universal broad scale sell off because we can see things like XLC XLF XLI all hit highs today. So there are sectors within the SP 500 that actually are still hitting highs Even though we saw a bit of a rotation over so what really led to that rotation over because if we take a look at XLY XLV XLU all of those were up slightly on the day XLRE was up on the day XLP was up on the day. So it was XLB So if you look at it most of the sectors were up generally on the day We have XLF and XLI which were read on the day, but both still gapped up and started much higher. So This is the problem tech. We saw XLK had a pretty significant down day today So technology continues to be a bit of a pain now Taking a quick look at just the heat map again You can see in elements",

What's not energy in and of itself is Generally read we're not seeing like massive selloffs, but definitely downside pressure and Consumer staples looks like it's performing well financials performing well Schwab had a pretty big gap up today Even though it was read on the day. It's still very much is up So overall we're getting into earnings and the market looks quite mixed So if we take a look at city group and Goldman Sachs from yesterday They both performed well with respect to EPS versus estimates versus actual And then today we saw continuation of that so PNC BAC even Schwab Schwab had a really interesting move if we pull up Schwab we can see again had a pretty big gap up but then ended down on the day So from a broad market perspective all this means keep risk front of mind we are not in this really calm persistent bull market We are hovering near highs here and people start to get really Gittery and things become slightly tenuous if we take a look at VIX on a six-month time frame We can see",

It's a little higher actually. I'm sorry It's like 16 and a quarter. I was using the point of control like yeah maybe 16 What I'm flagging for you is volatility is expanding at this point even though we're hovering at all time highs That kind of divergence is something to be aware of okay cool now Let's take a peek at DJT really quick because we came across some interesting stuff yesterday during the live stream that I want to highlight for everybody and DJT has been essentially this big proxy for Donald Trump potentially winning the election And if we take a look at the prediction markets as it sits it does look like that's right now the favorite outcome So I'll grab polymarkets for us and we literally can look at it together so here's polymarket and if we take a look at the Presidential election we can see that the winner right now and this actually",

That's a trader's mindset You should like whoever you like that's cool. I still want to try to make money on the event itself So that's why this is actually a really really great tool to forecast probability of things Probabilities of things because really smart people that are trying to make a lot of money are gonna be here And you can see there's five hundred seventy million dollars in here So well, that's just on the Trump side by the way So the market here is liquid. There's definitely people participating You can see it appears 1.9 billion total volume in this so lots and lots of people interested In the outcome So that takes us back then to DJT being this proxy For Trump winning the election now it contracted",

Who knows This is essentially a meme stock at this point This will ebb and flow as its popularity ebbs and flows But what I can say is it's made a move from 11 and three quarters and it almost hit 35 I mean, we're not that far off from 35 here So people are playing this for the general movement now if we take a peek at the options chain We can see a few things that it's kind of a even split calls and puts we can see 421,000 calls against 445k And you can see that the lion share of these bigger positions are 15 know which is obviously following the election So if we limit this by the election expiration you can see that it's 158 versus 153,000 for both Calls and puts respectively So yeah people are speculating here Lots of people are selling calls as we can tell 25 of the volume today was calls being transacted at the bit or below Typically a sale So this is overall just an interesting thing to follow along and if we grab unusual whales really quick We'll take a look at just the options",

So what I'm going to do is flag month to date which is today's the 15th So let's see what kind of trades we have coming in So there's one really big trade 935,000 in the 15 Nove 24 21 calls so these would have been up quite a lot yesterday I don't know where they're at today, but This person obviously this looks like a speculative play to the upside and we can see elements of that both to the upside to the downside And we can see that this option chain has gotten really active in the last month or so So that is DJT it's exhibiting pretty significant volatility implied volatility percentiles literally at 100 percent pegged up And it's at 313.6 IV super super high Now over to game stop we can see that it had a little bit of an inside day It was down just about a quarter point But there was some cool news now I am not going to pretend to know much about any of this because I don't But it's cool to see",

I do not So anyways, though this does look cool where we can see that there's a collaboration that started between game stop and PSA and you can see that it's going to become an authorized PSA dealer and PSA will provide grading services for trading cards Through select game stop stores So this doesn't look like massive news But it looks like some sort of activity which is what people are trying to see We're trying to see what the future looks like for game stop based on different pieces of trickled out information like this That gives some insights into what the future is going to look like because it's been very quiet We do know that they're sitting on quite literally billions in cash.

I can't read any of that. I'll be completely honest And I also have to be honest this Pikachu looks a little chubby We might need to get Pikachu some salad But I do like Pikachu.

I have never done this So I have no reference or how impactful this is but It does look like an interesting thing and it gives the stores a physical purpose now Because again like peripherals and stuff like that you can argue there's a physical purpose for sure But they can still be shipped and a lot of this stuff could be shipped But there's actually a lot more risk",
