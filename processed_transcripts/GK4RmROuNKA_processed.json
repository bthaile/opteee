    "text": "What's up everyone, Eric here. Welcome back to the outlier podcast and I have my friend, Dave Lauer. He's kind of a man of many hats, but right now he's the CEO of Irvin and he's also the co-founder of We The Investors. He's super involved in markets. He's been on the channel before, but it's been a minute because you've been a busy bee. What's up, man? It's good to have you back. Hey, thanks for having me, Eric. Always fun. Love what you're doing and love these conversations. I have a blast. And I mean, honestly, before we even press record button, we talked for about a half hour on all sorts of stuff. And we got into Peter Tia's work. You're talking about Hugherman Labs, all the fun stuff. But for here, I figure we'll start with a little bit more of a market-flavored tone. And really, I got to pick some beef with you literally. And obviously, the market-flavored tone is a joke. So I'm going to talk about Wagyu steak because I've had Wagyu steak a few times. And every single time I'm disappointed, I think it's an overpriced cut of me that is sub-part just about everything else I've had. I would love for you to change my mind because apparently you're the Wagyu man based on your Twitter comment. I'm so confused. All right, so look, I really love my steak. I want to say that, earnestly, that what is better than steak?",

And I have experimented with diets, not weight loss diets, like health diets, my whole life. And for quite a while, I was carnivore. And it was the best one. That was my thing. I'm apparently genetically not supposed to be a carnivore and the testing did not work for me. But it was fun. And I will say this that my daughter, her favorite food is steak. She's 11 and- Reason am right. Yeah, we take our steaks seriously in this house. So, you know, I think though, when you were talking on Twitter, you were saying that you prefer a lean cut. You're like a filet guy. So I do think that probably has something to do with it because my favorite cut is a ribeye. And, you know, a ribeye juicy fat flavorful, right? And when you get, when you step it up to wag you, and you cook it perfect, because it has to be cooked perfect, right? So I'll talk about this. I like the reverse sear.

It's just too fat. All right. I'm telling you, when we are finally in person, I'm going to change your mind on Wagyu. I'm open to it. I think Tomahawk are okay for a ribeye because you can get around the fat and then it's not too bad. But with the lague, there's no getting around it. It's everywhere. But they've got the butcher here. He's got first of all, he does an amazing age, like 45-day age Tomahawk. That thing is just exceptional. But he also does have Wagyu filet. It is much easier. I think that would be right up your alley. I do not like filet because it's too lean for my tastes. But I did have a filet Wagyu for my mom who also likes lean cuts. And she just thought it was exceptional. Really? Okay. That's a secret for you. It's promising. Speaking of promises, you promised me that inflation was transitory.

That was the last promise that we've had. So, figure we got to poke that there just a little bit and see where we stand. All right. I'm going to share this screen. I don't know if this is going to come through. Well, it's a little of a low-res chart, but here, there. Can you see that? Oh, it looks great. Yeah. It looks like super core inflation cools off. Nothing like good old super core inflation. That looks transitory to me. Now, let's be clear. Right now, I'm talking economic numbers and statistics. And I think that as you and I were kind of talking about a little before, there are two, I think there are two sides to inflation. There's what economists are measuring and looking at. And then there's what people are experiencing. So when I talk about inflation, I feel bad because now I think people think I'm like minimizing the real world impact. And I don't mean to do that at all. Like, inflation is horrible. Right. And that's why the Fed is doing what it's doing. The Fed is saying, you know, and maybe they're going to engineer soft landing, probably not, but I hope they will. They are saying that, you know, a recession, even if it's a severe recession, is preferable to inflation. And so that's how",

Nobody thought it possible. And the fact that it's even possible, I do, I do think it's really impressive from an economic and policy perspective. You know, a lot of people hate the Fed.

And yeah, so I think, yeah, it's interesting that the soft landing I got to say we're probably two opposite sides of that coin because as of right now, I'm like, to your point, maybe it happens, but man, that would blow my fucking mind.

So I have to maybe do a little bit more homework there because yeah, it's, I was doing a bit of research just on how fascinating this entire tightening cycle was. There was a lot of firsts that occurred during the technical, a lot of them. So to your point, even if it's like seriously being debated, that is interesting in and of itself, I think. Yeah, I mean, look, inflation got extremely high, right? Like 9 inflation is crazy. And that's really horrific. It hurts people real bad. And it hurts retirees on fixed incomes. Really bad, it hurts, you know, lower income people who are, you know, just eating out survival, you know, subsistence and survival level who can't afford increased prices.

But if you could maybe bubble up maybe the top two or three themes that you're talking with him about and the way that you see us moving forward on those themes, I think that would be really informative for people to understand the broader landscape because a lot of retail traders, they're just worried about clicking the button and trying to tee their way on their zero DTE options before they decayed a nothing. And I think sometimes people forget to kind of zoom out a little bit. Yeah, I think it's an interesting question. I think the two main themes from our conversations are that the rules in markets are old. They're the governing structure, which is called Reagan and S. S. for National Market System, was these rules were passed in 2005. Like the iPhone didn't even exist, right? And now it's 2023 and things have moved far past the reality, the technological reality of 2005. And so one of the themes that the SEC is trying to modernize equity markets. And our conversations have been focused on equity markets. A lot of people are into him and crypto. And I frankly don't have much to add to that. I think others do have much more insight than I do. I've had a few people on my podcast to talk a bit about it. But I really focus on equity market structure. And so one of the themes I think is that the",

And so one of the themes I think is that the SEC needs to modernize market structure, which I totally agree with. And frankly, a lot of people in the industry agree with. So there are two new rule proposals that came out of the SEC of the four that were really focused on that. The first was Update Rule 605, which is just a quantitative disclosure of execution quality and a venue. And now it will be extended to some large brokers. So you'll get a lot more visibility and transparency into how your orders are being handled. Hard to argue against it. And there has not been much opposition to it. And then the updates to Reagan MS again are to modernize markets. They're addressing tick size, which is the quoting and trading increments in markets, which are set to a penny for most stocks. And it's sort of a one size fits all approach to markets that doesn't really work. So they recognize that they're looking to shrink the tick size. Our argument was don't shrink it as much as you are talking about. And also widen it on the other side for less liquid stocks. And that will improve liquidity and execution quality on the other side.",

And then the other theme I would say, which is actually one of the main sort of governing philosophies of this administration. And this is the thing that I really like about what the Biden administration has done is about competition. And again, this is to me, especially the competition angle is one that should transcend politics. This is not something that I think is a partisan view. I think generally regardless of what side you're on, that competitive markets are a value that generally, especially Americans should hold quite dear. And what we see in our equity markets, much like we see in many other parts of our economy is corporate concentration of power. And in US equity markets, especially when you think about what happens to an order from a retailer individual investor, that order almost universally goes from your broker to Citadel or Virtue to one of two firms, maybe a third, there's a third that has a small market share,",

And that's a big problem. That's not how markets are supposed to operate, right? That you want competition to get the best price for that order. And you want it for a couple of reasons. You want it for the benefit of the individual investor, because today your brokers are not getting the best execution. And that's what the SEC said. They said if your broker accepts payment for order flow, the execution quality is not as good as if they don't accept payment for order flow. And this is something we've known. We've known this for years. And there's been studies for years on these issues. And the other thing is that that concentration generally hurts markets.

And so because of that, generally speaking, across markets, our spreads are too wide. And so that's a cost. Every transaction that happens in markets, people are paying more than they otherwise would. And that's retail investors, but that's also pension plans and institutional investors like mutual funds. So, you know, you as a retail investor generally get hit multiple times. You like to trade, you like to buy and sell your own stocks. That's great, but you're getting hit there. But you also hold some of your wealth in retirement funds and mutual funds, ETFs, you're paying higher transaction costs there too. And so I think that that's the SEC's approach is trying to identify where there's this concentration risk and come up with ways to introduce competition. Now, for retail traders a lot of times, I feel like they don't actually fully appreciate where they're getting hit, right? A lot of them see, they open up their Robinhood platform and it says zero commissions. So can you help us understand where those",

A lot of them see, they open up their Robinhood platform and it says zero commissions. So can you help us understand where those fees actually are being assessed? It kind of on the back end because this is one of the hardest things I think people don't understand what the idea of zero commissions is still fucking expensive. Yes, exactly. We've been on this, we've launched a campaign recently with the investors and we're basically the theme is free trading ain't free. You think it's free. It ain't, come on. You really think something on Wall Street is going to be free? Let's be honest with ourselves. You trust the financiers and bankers so much. They're out of the goodness of their heart. They're giving you free trading. They're just wonderful. They've never destroyed the economy or anything through their own greed. Now they would never do that. They never take unnecessary risks and try to concentrate power as much as possible to extract rents to buy a fifth, six, nine figure home. They would never do that. No way. It's not something they would do. So, yeah, so when you see free trading, you should be very skeptical. And I say that there are firms out there that offer free trading and they don't do these things. And those brokers are good",

And so that means that spreads are wider on exchange. So they have destroyed spreads. They've widened spreads by 30. That's the estimate. Spends are 30 wider than they otherwise would be. And then they price improve you like 5. You know, here's a 10. Here's a 2. Right? It's like that's the cost. The cost is if the system didn't exist, spreads would be 30 tighter. You wouldn't need any price improvements. Those prices would be great. You'd be thrilled with them. So that's the cost. The cost is that markets are more volatile and fragile. That's another cost, right? So in the presence of high rates of internalization, high rates of off-exchange trading in these retail wholesalers, extreme price movements increase significantly. Okay, because there's less liquidity. So markets become more fragile, less liquid. You have a bigger price impact. And if you're a big swing in, you must be here.

But if most of your retirement savings are in a pension plan or with in a mutual fund company that has to keep transacting, they're facing higher transaction costs. And that's why institutional investors broadly support a lot of these reforms as well. Because they want to see transaction costs come down. And what we see around the world is that in countries that don't have payment for order flow and don't have extreme fragmentation and don't have extreme levels of off-exchange trading, their market quality is actually higher than in the US. So a lot of people like to say, and if you look at the comment letters on these SEC rule proposals, every single middleman who is a proponent of the status quo put a comment letter in. And they're all say the same thing. US markets are the envy of the world or the best ever. Any time, anywhere, we can't touch them because everything's working perfectly.

I have two two last questions for you. One of which is the advent of zero DTE options, I know it's very niche. But I also know that you probably are at least peripherally familiar with most of this stuff. I'm curious from your background at Citadel and just understanding the way that markets work. What impact does that have on the fragility of markets, which is one of the terms you used just a little while ago. It's something that I've been tracking actually very carefully. A big part of my book is volatility trading. So I'm looking for stuff.

So I mean, I think it looked, I have a limited understanding. I'll say that. My limited understanding is that most of the time those options expire worthless. And so most of the time they're losing bet, you could probably say it's much more kind of gambling than almost anything else in markets. And if you are an options market maker, so you're writing those those contracts and just collecting that premium is the greatest fucking thing that's ever happened to you. And you are thrilled. And yes, Citadel has long been the largest or one of the largest players in options market making. Susquejana is another big one. And those are two well placed political contributors as well and Ken Griffin and Jeff Yes. So you know, those guys are happy. Ken Griffin is buying more and more Florida land and building bigger and bigger houses. So I think that that's most of what you need to know about those. I, you know, it's not something I've played.

Um, like you said, we're producing it. We're starting to produce a lot of educational content to help help people learn more about markets, which is, you know, sort of central part of our mission. Um, and I, I don't think I've ever been as optimistic on what we're building as I am today. I think that the rest of this year is just going to be fantastic.

It's super cool. So if you guys aren't familiar with it, make sure you check it out. I'll have a link in the show notes below. But Mr. Lauer, I've kept you over. I broke my promise. But, you know, the conversation, why do you, that had to happen. Yeah, the conversation why it got to happen. So thank you so much for the time, man. It's been a pleasure. I'll grab some of the links, you know, that we talked about to throw in the notes below. But yeah, thank you so much for the time. Yeah.
