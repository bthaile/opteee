Every time it's kind of like just seeing if I can get us off the launch pad and so far, I feel like we have a decent track record, I suppose. But yeah, you know, what else am I supposed to do here? I'm just out here doing my best. This is an old video for you. I have the swap video set up or if we need to reference that at all. But yeah, man, first off, welcome back. I'm actually really glad that we're kind of starting to do these regularly because one, it gives me a chance to continue learning from the master, which I literally love doing. And two, it gives everybody else a chance to kind of catch these periodic updates, right? Like as we're going through and seeing things unfold. So welcome back, stoked to have you. Yeah, thanks, Eric. Really appreciate it. And I, I think you said it really well. Like these updates are really good. I realized, you know, I have a habit of just doing a video every day with like what's on my mind. It's almost like stream of consciousness.

Everyone's looking for options activity. It's like, what's the story at right now? You know, what can we look forward to? What's the summary for the week? So I think it's good to do videos like this or, you know, yeah, man, kind of seconds like this. I absolutely love it. So right now for everybody's awareness, it looks like we have like 150 people on great to see everybody. They're coming to hang out and chat some game stop with us. So far, I'm not able to log into my platform. So we'll have to use some other tools when we want to start taking a look at some details. But that future us problem, you know, there's only so many things you can worry about at a given point in time. This is not one of them.

Do you want to kind of provide a quick rundown of those to lay some of a foundation? And the reason for everybody else's awareness that's kind of learning more about the story or already aware of the story, but curious why this matters. Because when we're trying to think about the way that the product moves, a lot of the reason why it moves the way it does is because of these forces and these rule sets that underpin things. It's why whenever I'm doing videos and you know talking about game stop, I'm always very careful to say like standard technical analysis in my opinion doesn't translate well to something like game stop. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that there are all these other injects that absolutely have a dominating effect on price and volume. So yeah, I'd love to start with an assessment slash just general overview of these settlement rules. Yeah, do you want me to go ahead and share my screen? Is that cool? I would love that.

So I think you laid the groundwork pretty well. I think that with other stocks, you probably wouldn't be ultra concerned about settlement because liquidity is pretty robust. You know, you're going to have lots of buying and selling on the stock. I think with something like game stop, the fundamental problem here is liquidity. With so many shares being dominated by household, especially in periods like right now, you can see tremendous volume. But where are the market makers and the broker dealers going to go to get shares? You know, if they don't, if they don't have inventory, they're going to need to push all the rules to the maximum. So we need to know how the rules work to get an understanding of why we see volume happen on particular days. You know, days where we consider nothing's going on. There's nothing going on the stock. Why would it suddenly have 100 million volume? Why would the price suddenly go up 5 here? 800 there? You know, so that's where the rules become really important. So I made a tab here",

It's the third tab over actually combined the two tabs before into one tab. So I've got all the rules for settlement here. I'll make this really big over here on the left. So under regulation, SHO, this is the settlement rules. We just recently moved into a T plus one settlement period. That means that, you know, I buy a stock today. It should be settled into my account by tomorrow, sending with cash. If I move cash from my bank of America account into my trading platform to take one data to sell one out, set a two, which is great. Supposedly, my understanding is options contracts still take two days to settle. Do you know if that's the case? I think it is. I think so too. Yeah. So right now, they're aligning off of the same settlement period. So I think that that's, I think it's two T plus one now, no? I think because it's a contract, not an actual equity, I think it's still on T plus two, but I might be mistaken on this. So that's a curiosity.

The chat, the chat might know and I also think I have a download of the actual release. So let me dig that up in the meantime. Sure. But, you know, under regulation, SHO or Reg show for short, there's two particular rules that are really of interest, rule 203 and rule 204. They allow market makers to fail to deliver trades after T plus three and T plus six. And we can actually see that in action on the stock. What's really hard here, and I think that there's a lot of people that get frustrated on the forums because people are really caught up right now on roaring kiddies by a four million in shares. But there's a reason to be caught up on that trade. That's a huge trade, right? And we get precious few moments in time where we get to see a huge trade and no one. Right. And Cohen bought in in 2020. So we actually have his trade dates from his disclosures. And so we can actually see a rule happening here, which is he bought on December, right here. He bought on December 17th, quite a few shares across four days. But you don't see gigantic price improvement until T plus three, especially like",

So you can actually see that happen in real time here. That's why people are still curious about roaring kiddies purchases, not only do they match the size of Ryan Cohen's from back in 2020, but it gives us dates through which to follow to see if the rules can out the way we expect them to. But the one of interest is rule 204. They grants calendar days plus 25. And so down here, I basically mapped this out. You can see like, let's say you've got a trading date like December 22nd. The market maker should clear those trades by T plus three or T plus six. So those are trading days, so in days. But the calendar days include the weekends, but not market holidays. So then you want to count those out 35. And they absolutely have to close out by C plus 35 if you want to call it C plus 35. So that's basically how all those rules work. It's just what people are looking for now is, okay, so we know a big trade happened probably. You can tell me what you think about this. I think he sold his options on",

And then bought the shares the following day on the 13th or sold most of the options like 80,000 of them here and then 40,000 more sold those there and then bought all the shares. So what everyone wants to know is are we going to see because we didn't really see T plus three or T plus six produce very much. There is volume, but not a lot of price improvement. So are we going to see something on 35 calendar days, which is basically going to be somewhere out here in the days to come. So does that give people a good enough idea on how settlement should work? Is that pretty clear? Yeah, yeah, that's super helpful. And I think that it paints a really important picture on why it matters, right? Because there's a lot of different perceptions of what it looks like. And also, by the way, for option, it is T plus one. Yeah. So I grabbed, I threw a link in the chat for everybody.

And I'll throw it in the chat here too. All right, thanks. Yeah, man. So the, the hard part with calendar days is people forget about the market holidays. So this is a really good example to give because there are market holidays on this one. So like, let's say, Rory and Kitty did buy. And I think it's pretty obvious he bought on the 13th because that's when he was doing the sandworm. Dune meme, right? He, he posted the, the dune meme on Twitter. And then the stock start, starts rising immediately. It's like who just bought a whole bunch of shares. Pretty obvious.

We have to add another column in here for you, like between AMB that auto populates it for you. I always thought about doing that.

Should produce lots of buying. This is next week. And this is like something like 40 of the OI going forward, all concentrated on the third week, a third Friday of July. Yeah. And again, none of this is financial advice. You know, that's a near-dated option that's extremely risky. But there's a lot of people front-loading options into next week. So I'm curious what you think about this because this seems unusual to me. I think, well, which part seems unusual to you? Just to have such a concentration here with such a near-term expiry.

And then there can be pockets further out of other things that are showing activity. But the vast majority of instances, you'll see the overwhelming activity in the front explorations. Now, what I find so fascinating about GameStop's options in particular, though, is the variance. That part is very interesting where you can see the options chain. Actually, if you go back to that other screen, well, I liked it background. Yeah. So you can eyeball this and you can see inherently where the standard explorations are. Like just look at the numbers that are much higher than the, exactly, like you can straight up eyeball it. Now one of the things that's so interesting about GameStop, though, is the variance between further out explorations and closer ones because to your point, your eyeball of seeing, like, heavy near-term volume or OI in the option space, that's, it's not inherently anomalous. That's pretty normal. But what is fairly anomalous is how big it is comparatively front versus further out. But I've noticed that essentially being like a rolling trend with GameStop.

    "text": "OI in the option space, that's, it's not inherently anomalous. That's pretty normal. But what is fairly anomalous is how big it is comparatively front versus further out. But I've noticed that essentially being like a rolling trend with GameStop. It's actually been one of the most interesting things about the product to me is like, I've talked about the way that I buy options typically. I've shared a video a million times. I'll share it again. And it's because I think a lot of people light money on fire with the way that they buy options trying to trade something like GameStop and specifically hear what confounds me as going so short term perpetually because those options are going to decay the fastest. And they will experience more of a move if you do eventually get a move in your favor. But if you don't, they decay pretty fast. So yeah, the kind of a meandering answer. The short one is seeing the active options being really focused in these near-term explorations that doesn't surprise me. Seeing it centralized in 19 July doesn't surprise me because that's a standard expiration. And the thing that does interest me though is just how big of a variance there is between the front explorations and then like the next month expiration. Having a gap that's typically like 100,000, like several hundred thousand O.I. Difference, that's interesting to me. Cool. Yeah. So I think what's also interesting is the community is largely avoided",

I'm sort of curious what you're thinking about. It just seems like in this last couple of months, there's been far more in the money options than I remember there ever being because I could remember this maybe just like me misremembering or wanting to remember something. But it seemed like every week, you know, people would be bummed out because they would see all these out of the money options on a Friday. But these days it seems like there's more landing in the money. So maybe do you think maybe people are learning picking up on some stuff? Yeah, that's a great question. And I'm not exactly sure because I don't have a great understanding of the standard purchasing behavior before to like draw what I would consider to be a more direct comparison. But if I were to take a swag at it, I think a big part of that also comes down to people learning more about the products themselves.

So I think there's something probably coming from that angle. I also think that there's another angle that just focuses on how much raw dollars you can make. So there's a lot of reasons to go in the money. Like typically when I'm buying options, the overwhelming majority of instances, they're greater than 60 days out. A smaller subset sometimes will be 30 days out that like I typically won't go same week unless I'm playing something very short term that I can look at decisively. But I most of this time will be a little bit further out in time and it's almost always for the base position at the money or slightly in the money. And it's because you get a better dollar for dollar move with the underlying at a higher delta.

But the thing, the way to think about it is out of the money options are cheaper. They will compound as a percentage return much better than in the money options. They require a bigger move in order for them to like really start printing for you. And they will have slightly different theta decay tendencies depending on what the delta is and stuff like that. So my general approach to most things in life is actually balance. So I don't inherently do just one. I typically will have a base position little further out in time, typically at least slightly in the money, if not deep in the money. And then I'll add what I call kicker options. And those are near term expiration further out of the money. And that's really to capture a magnitude of a move if I get it because those options can compound super fast. But they are fighting a steady steady headwind of theta decay. And unless you get a big move real quick, they become worth less super fast.

Does this have delta? This is just Yahoo finance. I may very adept trader that uses very powerful tools. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think that that's okay to ballpark it there. Let me see real quick. I have another platform I can also look at what expiration are you in right now? I am in October. Got it. Yep. So those are 98 days out.

So the most liquid choices I see look to be about either the 25s. That's a really, really heavy strike. There's 2600 rely there. So that tells me that there's transactions in there. What three there bid at 515 offered at 550. So that would be fine. I personally would probably want a slightly higher delta because those options are a lot of extrinsic value. So those are also going to decay a little quicker than I would prefer. And so we're waiting by that. Let me just slow down a second. So since the strike is 25 and the price is five, you're basically you got to value this at basically like 30 bucks and the stock isn't at 30 bucks yet. Your 4 short of that. So 4 worth of that is like extrinsic right now wrapped up in theta. Yeah. So the way to think about the calculating the amount of theta in the options, it's the difference between the current price and the strike price. So current price is 20604. That strike price is 25.",

So the way to think about the calculating the amount of theta in the options, it's the difference between the current price and the strike price. So current price is 20604. That strike price is 25. So an option price has two components intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value simply put is how far in the money it is. So in this case, it is 1 and 4 cents in the money. So if we take the midpoint between the bid and the ask to value the option, let's just call it a 525 just for ease. So you would take 525, that's the total value of the option. You would subtract out your intrinsic value, which is a dollar and four cents. And then the remainder of that is extrinsic value. So that would be 4 and. 221. 4 and 2 and 2. Yep. And that's all basically now subject to theta decay, right? Exactly. That's all going to slowly decay away. And the good part about being further out in time is you decrease the rate of theta decay, but you're paying more upfront. So more total theta can decay. Right. Because you paid 525 exactly to buy you that time. So yeah, perfect. And it decays exponentially, right?

Now it's going to accelerate. Two months go by. It's going to accelerate a lot. And then as you get closer and closer and closer, there you go. You got to write there on screen. So yeah, I totally stole the screen share from you. But you actually do a great job explaining this exact graph. So what this in the top right is this is just showing you the behavior of the Greeks. But what you'll notice is theta decay starts to really accelerate once you start getting within 60 days to expiration. And then it becomes highly exponential within 30 days. So and this simply put is because options, they have to make a choice. All of these out of the money options, they are going to go to zero. They have no intrinsic value. So as you get closer and closer to expiration, these are going to move way, way faster. So that's why you see this accelerate to that degree. So when I'm using something, I'm just using ORETS.

The next thing is if I do not get a high delta being further out in time, I'm not going to experience as much of the move because. So experience delta for me. What's delta? Great question. So there are a handful of Greeks that we care a lot about. Delta is one of them. So delta does a few things for us. The high level view of what delta does is it tells us the rate of change of an options premium per one point move in the underlying price.

So delta tells us the rate of change of an options premium. You can use it for other things. It's kind of a back of the napkin tool for probability of in the money, probability of touch. So in like layman's terms, if game stop goes up 1 tomorrow, your option will go up 1, it'll go up 0.6, 4. It's based on a dollar move. So it's not based on percentage moves, but yes, it would essentially move a fraction of the dollar move. Okay. A question. I have another question. Yeah. So that's algorithmic, right? That's controlled by options pricing, which is inherent within how their schema works. But what if demand comes in suddenly and like wipes out all the sell orders on that particular strike, who would you sell it for a higher amount because it's just in demand at that moment?

So if we're looking at it in a vacuum, just in a vacuum, and the options are moving a lot and we're just pretending for whatever reason the underlying cannot move, the underlying is frozen, then there would be observably little change in the value, the price of those options. This is an vacuum, which is not reality. Because as that's happening, the underlying is probably moving for one reason or another, which then creates kind of this cycle that we can see where as people are piling into options, the market makers typically are the other side of the trade, they will start hedging their positions by using the underlying and other options, which can move the underlying itself. So there can't really be a buy supply in balance because if a lot of buy orders come in for a particular strike and expiry, the market makers will just write contracts for that. Yeah. And if it's in that scenario where it's very one-sided order pressure, they can widen their bid-ask spreads to manage their risk. And in that case,",

So in that case, like let's say, like Rory and Kitty came in and wiped out or bought all the 20 strikes for June 21st, I believe it was. If you had already held those particular contracts, would you have seen a sudden surge in the price of your options that have been able to move on that beating the market makers to it? Or do they basically beat you to the punch? It would be the market makers leading the change in the price based on their assessment of the order flow. So you wouldn't see the price move unless it was adjusted by the market makers. Again, looking at this in a vacuum, pretending that the underlying isn't moving, looking at just the options. Okay. Cool. It's one of the things to always keep in mind with something like options or really any other derivatives, the market makers are very much slaved to the order flow.

Their ideal scenario would be to have a bit in an offer and you want to buy options. I sell them to you and then I immediately turn around and neutralize and flatten them and buy them from somebody else that's selling them, right? And essentially collect a bit ask spread. And if we see really strong one-sided order flow, it actually puts them in a terrible spot because they now have to accumulate massive inventory and nobody's offloading their risk, which is what they would prefer to be able to do. So in those instances, they can absolutely widen the bit ask spread and they can say, the bit ask spread is an expression of what they're pricing volatility at. But then it's also an expression typically that it would be a size, right? So they would say, I'm bid at 515 for 100 lots. I'm offered at 550 for 500 lots.

And they're trying to be lighter on the bid side and that's typically a way for them to manage their book. So are you seeing this behavior now? Are you seeing an acceleration of options buying on GameStop and then therefore a widening of the spreads? It's not a universal widening of the spreads. But one of the things to always remember is on a relative basis, you can always come up with kind of like an assessment of what's something that's liquid, right? So let's check out just an example really quick in Spy. And we'll go to those that same expiration cycle, which I think is here. And we were looking at like a 64 delta option. The reason why I use 64 delta is or something like that is to normalize across the different products for the basis of a comparison. So right here. So these options, they're bid at 26 offered at 34. So the process to like assess liquidity of something, I would literally take 1734. I would subtract 1726. That gives you the bid ask spread, eight cents. You can now take that bid ask spread of eight cents divided by the strike price. Right. Multiply that by",

You can now take that bid ask spread of eight cents divided by the strike price. Right. Multiply that by 100. Now you have a percentage and this is normalized to everything. So the percentage of the bid ask spread here of the strike price is 0.014. So even though is that automatically calculated somewhere, do you see that showing up somewhere? No, I do it. Oh, okay. Yeah, they don't they don't normalize it for you. What I've learned in a lot of instances, they don't make this stuff easy for some striking reason. We also use lots of silly terms when we're talking about this stuff. So I'm finding it interesting that you target the 64 delta. Is that common because look how heavy the activity is there for the spy? It's not so much that it's a 64 delta. It's more that it's a round number. You'll notice that the 50s, right, big number. Humans are hilarious. We're so predictable. 560s, bigger number, 565s, bigger number, right? So five dollar increments. It's just a very natural cognitive bias.

So like, let's say for example, I wanted to buy an option and for whatever reason I wanted something around a 60 delta, I'm going to gravitate to this one because there's more liquidity here than everything else. And everyone else is doing the same thing. So it becomes like a kind of like a ball rush or a like a crowd mentality. It can be. It's really more in pursuit of liquidity though. It's not that, oh, I think other informed traders are going here to 555. So I want to do what they're doing. It's more, I don't want to pay as wide of a bid-ask spread. So I'm going to do everything I can to keep this as small as possible. Now the market's closed. So I mean, realistically, this has a similar size market, right? So you can easily go here at the probability of you getting filled here versus here at the same bid-ask spread is actually very low. You'll probably get a better fill on the 555s. So just finishing the example quickly, going back to GameStop looking at these 64s. So right now and other people can try this, right? So you just take the 550, you subtract 515.

Oh zero. So huge. Over some massive. Massive difference. That's because it's a volatile product. If things are more volatile, they will have wider bid-ask spreads. It serves as kind of like a natural breaking system for markets. So there's just another thing for people to be aware of. If you're trading small contracts and you're not trading a ton, it doesn't necessarily matter a bunch. But it will explain to some degree why you will find people central again. 25, 30. It's the same thing. It's the same mental tendency to look for these round numbers. And then people will gravitate to where the rest of the volume is. So a significant difference to like, if you're looking at the delta of 64 versus the delta of 82, that's going to cause a big difference in the behavior of the options contract. Because if GameStop goes up a dollar, I'm netting way more of that move. So way more is intrinsic there. Right. Is what we're saying there at the. Exactly.

It's that's exactly the way to look at it. It's a way of gaining leverage. So every options contract holds up to 100 shares of the underlying, right? Each options contract is worth 100 shares. The way you can look at the delta is that tells you how many shares the position is behaving as right now, right? So remember, delta tells us the dollar change. And or it tells us the premium rate of change for every dollar move in the underlying. So essentially each one of these is behaving like one share. That's so that is exactly why you will see these move and give you a better gross dollar return. However, something like this can give you a slightly better compounding return, where you're putting up less money, right? Because these are called 525 versus these where you're paying 760 something like that. So these are paying more, but if you get a move, you'll make a bigger gross dollar amount. These you're paying slightly less, but you will see a slightly less dollar move. For the underlying itself.",

So that's the cool part about options is that you really have the ability to construct positions. That makes sense to you that really align with what you're trying to accomplish. So typically I'll have a base position that looks like this. So out here in the 25s and it's I literally have these right now. And then I'll put on shorter term positions, typically two weeks, three weeks, something like that. If I start seeing price movement and I'll do something that's a little closer to at the money or slightly out of the money. And it's because these can compound a lot. So the delta you're looking for on these is maybe somewhere around 0.5. I would less than that. So typically I would be looking like a 30 delta, 40 delta. A big thing is making sure that you're getting exposure to enough gamma, which this doesn't show me for some reason. But gamma in a nutshell is the rate of change of delta. So that's essentially an options ability to compound. So options that are closer to expiration. That's what this is here. This yellow line represents closer to expiration. We'll have a higher gamma.

And that just tells us that the delta is going to change faster, which is where your compounding return potential comes from. But it gives and takes. If it goes against you, it means that you're going the wrong way super fast. So it's a delicate dance. So I'm hearing a lot of talk about options crush recently, right? Because we just had a period where the stock cooled down a lot. So and I think that's what you just kind of like. Talk to a little bit, right? The idea of like it turning against you. You all of a sudden your options lose a ton of value very quickly. Would that be an options crush right there? It's kind of a perversion of the term. I get what they're trying to say. Typically when you'll hear people talk about options, crests of some sort, we generally referring to volatility actually. We normally volatility crush.

So there's 56,180 of these options way out here at 125. And their bid at five cents offered at six. Now again, this is a not my platform. This is just not my boat. But typically I would have theta in here to show you how much this decays. But on a daily basis, a huge chunk of this will decay out. So you could probably ballpark it to about a penny, which would be a dollar. But that's a fifth of the position after one day goes. It's gone. Just gone. So they will decay very, very fast. And most of these options that have these tiny little deltas, they can compound incredibly if you get a big old move in your favor. If you do a question, here's a question I've always had. So like looking at the strikes, they're at 100, right? So stock starts moving. Let's say the stock moves up 20 tomorrow or on Monday, we see a settlement cycle hypothetically, not financial base.

Roughly speaking, that strike, if I was holding one contract, because the underlying is now moved 20, I should get, because it's got a delta, what's the delta on that guy? It's zero, because it's so far out of the money. Right. So it won't move in value, right? It will. They just, because delta, it goes beyond two decimal points. So there's three, four, five decimal points to these really far out of the monies. Okay. And then it will only start changing in value as the strike approach is 100, right? Yes. So this either you would need to see the underlying move in the favor of the position. So in this case, if we're long these, you would need the underlying to go up, or if volatility exploded for some reason, if volatility goes up a lot, the premium of all options goes up. Now, who is quantifying, or is it a static calculation for just volatility? So volatility, when you say, who's, are you saying like who's determining it? Because it's, you know, it's a function of what the underlying is doing, right? So the stock is, it's a function of what the underlying is expected to do. So how, how is that derived? Great question.

And essentially, there are different types of volatility that we use. So on the trading side, more often than not, we use implied volatility. This is where we're taking whatever volatility has already been baked into the price and we're pulling it out and we can see what it is. That's implied volatility. Now, what you're referring to is what's called forecast volatility. This is what market makers are doing. They're essentially maintaining a volatility surface model that postulates what volatility is going to be going forward. There are a lot of different ways to create these models. They're proprietary by nature. The reason why they're proprietary is because that's literally, if you can price evolve better than that person, you can make more money than them.

And so- And so there was a clip on SuperSonic about just that today or yesterday, right? Famous clip from, it was quite a while ago, it was like over 15 years ago, but talking about the latency and how much they're paying, not just for speed, right? For internet speed, server location, but they're paying for particular levels of information and quality of information from the markets. And the markets are actually making the exchanges or making more money on that. And then they're making on offering those premium packages for information, quality, and speed of information than they are on the actual trading. So, but what I'm curious about is when you're showing the volume on GameStop options as an example, it seems so low to me. Is that still going to be an efficient market where like a strike in that expiry only has volume on a day of maybe 50 or 100, like if you go to the daily volume on some of these, or even lower in some cases. So is it still efficient? Yeah, it is. It'll always be relative to the size of the product, but yeah, like I still absolutely, because relative to the size of this stock, like there's actually a, a lot of activity in here, like a",

So it's almost the inverse, right? So like if you look at like other companies, well GE's kind of big, but I don't know what this look like. I'm literally seeing, yeah, look, look at the OI here. 14, 24, 183, and this is 159 stock. This is GE, this is a big company. And you can see just how little activity there is here. There's, and this is big for this product, the 1,500. So it's almost actually the inverse where GameStop is crazy active for the size. And it is. We should see efficiently priced options. Moderately. The reason why I say moderately is because of the way that this moves, which is again, what makes it so fascinating, is from a market-making perspective, you literally have to be ready to be ran over by a train whenever you're making a market in this. So I mean by that. The fact that GameStop does this. It goes from 17 to 48.

We saw options printed two or three times now, at least in the last two to three months. More actually, probably, because May 3rd would be a big option sprinting in the whole week to follow.

But they will use options tremendously, because the only thing that it's really important to remember is that option market makers, they have a book of a ton of things, right? It's not just individual strikes, that counterparty to a person's single trade. They're on the other sides of thousands of trades. So they can use options that, it's actually why they're so interested in all of the Greeks, because they can mitigate a lot of their risk by using options or even more interesting, actually, I gotta get my tinfoil hat.

So you're telling me every option's order is that true for equity orders too, has a flag on it that says informed versus uninformed. I don't know if it's every single one. I couldn't speak intelligently to the actual process that they flagged, but what they can do is identify order flow that looks, it looks not like standard retail, right? Like the vast majority of retail trades, they're gonna assume is uninformed to a degree and they're not necessarily gonna worry about it too much. But if they see somebody like Roy and Kitty, for example, I actually spoke to one of my buddies that's a market maker for this exact thing. So I was just curious. I was like, how would you even manage this position? And the first thing he said is that he would immediately hedge because he doesn't wanna have open-sized risk with something that looks informed. So the way that it looks informed is that it's really big size somebody taking a big bet. And they're also willing to enter multiple times, right? Like they're building a position.

In terms of what order flow is normal for a product and then what order flow becomes anomalous. They're fantastic at that. So it's another way that they can identify opportunities in things like mergers and acquisitions. They can see crazy order flow for earnings. They can see inside or order flow and then try to front-run it. So essentially they're looking for certain kinds of behaviors and patterns that they identify is different for the underlying, the standard, run of the mill transactions. And they're looking for things like size, persistence, the way that they're structuring the trades. And then they can make a assessment and think, okay, do I wanna bet against this guy? If so, they would under hedge. If they don't wanna bet against the guy, but they're not sure that they wanna run with them, they'll just essentially hedge the position totally and just run a pure hedge and collect what they can off of that.

Yeah, it's really, really hard to discreetly identify who was piling on, but there was a lot of people piling onto those. Right, so a lot of household and retail could have after the fact, but we saw, I believe, his position come in, got built during that week of the share offering. But then there were also, there were too many of these block orders of five to 10,000. There was more than just him doing that kind of a play. So that could be people just basically mirroring his trade. Kind of like I think you said you do at times, right?

Yeah, definitely not like that at all. So for a comparison, if we look over the last 30 days, the biggest trade was 875, which I'm not dumping on that, right? Like that's not an insignificant trade. That's a billion dollar options trade for... But that's the other hilarious thing about like looking at this stuff is just how much it like skews the perception of reality. Let's take a look at the 19 expiration coming up. So the biggest trade for this upcoming 19 July expiration is 234K. It was the biggest trade.

Conceivably, options only could that have been accomplished off of like a small starting position? How much could he have made playing that from before? Basically, this is like early May, in May 13th and 14th. I don't even know like the magnitude of, because I've never played options. I don't know how much you can make on them. Could that have been done? In terms of when you say could that have been done? You mean making how much? So making enough to buy that next position. He would have needed about 170 million to buy those shares and buy all those, one to put those, those 20 calls. Right? So he needs, my theory is he needs 170 million in cash on May 15th to start building his next position. If he started with say 5 million in cash on May 1st, can you turn 5 million on May 1st into 170 million two weeks later? Is that possible? Could he, I would have to look closer at the numbers.

But it would be highly improbable is the way I would frame that. Like the probability of turning five into almost 200 million over the course of those two weeks, I don't think that is a highly probable scenario. So theoretically it makes more sense. We're not trying to nail it down or anything here at all or just spit falling. But he probably came into, there you go, he probably came into May 15th with like already a large cash position established. And he probably had to have done something similar with Chewie because out of nowhere, he shows up with nine million shares at Chewie, which I don't know how much those cost him.

I mean, if it could be options and it could be options that I learned. And I also don't know if there's a difference between the G and the D. I don't know. Yeah, that part I don't know either. Maybe maybe somebody in the chat knows. I imagine the D you show the position on the G, you don't have to show what the purchase, well, no, the purchase date or the event date is noted on the G, but the price paid is not shown or anything like the positions are shown on the G. Just the like what the representation is in number of shares and what percent that is of the outstanding. So yeah, super curious. I just, you know, when is he going to come back? I don't think he's gone for good again. But are we going to see more details on that position? Because that's crazy. Did not expect that at all. I'm not going to",

Literally. And I tell you my brain is already too close like a steamed vegetable. So I don't need to actually become a physical one. I think there's such a crazy potential for him to go so many routes after that. Gee, like I don't think it's any sort of happenstance that he hasn't shown a portfolio update for about a month now. I know that there was a lot of people that were really expecting to see something like yesterday. That part I find just so intriguing, right? He was pretty rock steady with these updates. And then he just stopped for some reason. That I find I find very curious. I don't know what to make of that. Do you have any ideas? Well, we can look at the timing, right? So let me, let me look at the timing. I'm going to pull up. He has only posted his yellow updates since returning on June 13.",

Then he posted another update after that, like that evening. And I think the key there, I think what he was trying to telegraph was, I'm not pumping this thing, right? I just showing my position because he could have taken action and he made no action, right? Because the media, like it was blaming him for the events for tweeting, right? On the rise up to 80, right? So by not taking any action during this Monday morning pump, he's basically saying like, I'm not actually causing this to happen. He did one more update on the sixth. And again, his position is completely unchanged on the sixth. Then he livestreams as it's pumping again on the 7th, 6th and 7th. It doesn't do anything with this position. So you can count, you can count the 7th as a yellow update. Can we just pause there for a second and just soak in the fact that we're looking at a portfolio that has 250 million in gains on the day.

Company has now sold 75 million shares. And what does he do? Basically doubles down. Yep. Like if that's not because, you know, I see all these comments. I just saw a comment on my channel today. Someone basically saying like, we're in kid. He's going to leave. He's lost faith in the company. He just got hundreds of million dollars on stock. You know, like, there's, there's nothing, there's nothing about much of anything in here that indicates to me that he's trying to leave even from even from that options position.

The media should be like saying how amazing this is because like, if this is an incredible, just an incredible play, like you said, so much conviction, right? It was so, so, so much conviction that you could just ride it and follow it and do well because you know that someone with this amount of strength and what they're doing has to know what they're doing, right? I think that that's a really fair assessment. There's a comment from Franz Zoo who says he 99 could turn a few millions into more than 100 millions in two weeks. Look how he made four days on half a billion. I think the one thing I would note for you, Frances, think about the difference in magnitude, right? Few millions into hundreds of millions versus starting from 200 million and then going to essentially 500 and change. So at one point, he had almost a billion like on this on the 6th, right?

So when he started going through that like almost becoming a bill and I think he made a tweet about that too, which was hilarious. He said you were a billionaire, which is putting, you got a pretty tinfoil hat back on for us, but maybe he is a maybe he had a billion in cash going into this because if he played just 2020 into 2021 doing a thousand X or 2019 into 2021, he did a thousand X on his position. There's been enough volatility in the meantime on just this one stock for him to create a very large position. The only thing I would say and a couple people have said similar things that I'm just not sure about is on the stream when the thing was plummeting, he made the explicit comment of like this is my only account and these are my only positions.

Is this so is this only is this is only position or does he have other positions than this other capital. So does RK have a large cash pile or other positions outside of the E trade portfolio? He's shared with us. Because the thing that considers he poses or his 13G trade event is for the what the 24th. I believe that's a fidelity account. My bad guys, whatever the account is.

So I think because there's the rest, I think he says that new positions, but I suppose, I know there's some cash there. That's what I made it depends on your positions, but that's another yolo again. He does. He does say his cash position, but I think he's just kind of riffing off the fact in trying to at least I took it as he's trying to reinforce the fact that he doesn't have any other positions.

I got some cash in there. I got some cash. Oh, God. Well, anyways, yeah. So that's what I thought was really interesting, because because I really do think he's very transparent and I believe that when he said that, I really do, I take him at his word, but that I mean, it still wouldn't be crazy to not have, you know, it would not be crazy for him to have some cash in something else. Like you still got to live. I don't know if he has a family, but he does. And I'm curious how he would have built his chewy position because I was this was on the he's talking here on the seventh and then his last update is on three days later on the 10th. He's converted now all those options into shares. And then there was one on one. Oh, 13th. Sorry. So 13th is his last one. So yeah, that's a week later.

The one thing I think about the one thing I think about is using options as compared to buying shares. Right. Some of it could be options for sure. Because even if he used in the money options in chewy, I mean, but like I also imagine we would see the position, we can we could see the position. So let's go back to this. Let's go to chewy. And then what was the date range we were talking about? So it needs to be if this is only a count he's playing with here between June 13th. Okay. And I think June 24th. Okay. I'm adding one day on both sides just in case. Okay. I think let me look at just 13G. Okay. Because it doesn't show the, does it show the basis in there or no? Yeah. It should. Because there it is.

So it was filed on the first, but the date of his June 24th. So there's 10,000 contracts there. This is, that's a million shares. There's 10,000 contracts here at the 30. That's another million. Well, something won't know. I don't know. If he did a yellow update on the 13th, the 13th. Okay. These were the, these are, and these are afterwards. These are the 25th. So I have to use the actual window. Because those wouldn't apply that window. The price moved a lot. So there's, there's a 10,000 at the 27th, which was a 220,000 dollar trade, but this represents a million shares. So far cry for 9 million. But that's, there's, there's a possibility, right?

So it doesn't look like he would have done it discreetly with options. But again, pretending that at least some portion of this could, could be this. Then it looks like he would have been able to essentially gain exposure to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 shares for less than a million bucks total. Somehow he's got to get 6 million more shares, right? And they're expensive. Still, I mean, they're like 20 bucks each at the lowest. It wouldn't, I mean, it wouldn't necessarily surprise me. If my hypothesis there is that he could have unwound some of his game stop position. And then my expectation there would be that he would be doing that to enter back in. Like I don't think he's trying to leave it. But it looked like he was trying to move something in Chewy. That was my guess. Maybe we can't know what he does with his positions in the interim.

In terms of his tendencies, but yeah, because yeah, cash, cash had to come from somewhere and 9 million shares of Chewy. What was it trading at 2653? You said. Right here. The low was 2180, which he definitely wouldn't have gotten in at. What was the, what's the midpoint like between the low and the high, just to. In here, it's like 25. 25. Yes. 225 million dollar position. Right. The other thing too is that like his last meme is. You know, he or one of his last ones, besides the Chewy one, right? You know, you got the hat on still, which is perfect, but you know, he's. Exactly. Listen, I'm baking for both of us. My fucking brain is cooking, but it needs to happen. He's, he's posting this meme as he puts in the by order. I think that's abundantly clear. Because then he immediately that afternoon, Yolo updates with his 9 million shares, right?

And he's meaning on Ryan Cohen kind of undoes his meaning on Ryan Cohen too. I think potentially, but he had a very light cast. Again, this is I can't believe him. I think he had 6 million in cash, right? So a light cash position, but not light, right? 6 million fucking dollars, but he had a he had relative to him, small cash. So 6 million dollars in cash, a 225 million dollar trade in Chewy goes on. If it's all shares, you can knock off again, giving the benefit of the doubt, assuming that all of this was him, which again, that that's probably not super likely for all of this volume to be him. But again, some combination of it could be. So that gives us 3 million shares here. So then he essentially would still have about 6 6 million 1000 ish shares. You're looking at all strikes, all X-rays look there or you're only looking at certain strikes next. You're just looking at any large traits. Yeah.

He had 6 million in cash. So again, you can knock that down to 144. But that's got to come from somewhere. And I know some people were talking about maybe he was trading options around it. In order to come up with that 100 million, we would have absolutely seen that volume come through and we didn't. So yeah, just curious. I think we got to wait and see. We can speculate yeah, till the end of time, right? It is still fascinating. The timing. I think that yeah, I think that's a lot of the fun part is you know the dude thinks in layers, right?

The second of June or the third of June? His first post was on the second. Yeah. And it wouldn't have come from just buying and holding all of this that entire time frame.

And I mean, he had a shit ton of positions on and a ton of stuff. So obviously he says at one point, I was watching the January 13th stream. He said he was monitoring over a thousand stocks to some degree, which is that that's just madman level right from the jump to even try to trade a thousand things, right? Like that's nuts. I struggle, I struggle keeping an eyeball on like 150 names. Yeah. Yeah. He's operating on a level that is completely unbelievable.

And Bruno, I believe in the movie, people say it goes away for 10 years. So he goes away for exactly 10 days, calls the chewy spike to the day. This is when Chewie hit 40. And he had built his position in Chewie, you know, leading up right into that spike, especially on the 24th. And then he filed a 13G a couple days later. And then we didn't know what this meant at the time. But then this is like his 13G gets, and then we look back and we're like, oh, that's we've been chewing. So it's like, quick question. Yeah.

Yeah, I think that's fair and I think people might slightly misconstrue like the intentions of accumulating a lot of shares, which is the idea of conviction as compared to trying to move into leadership or run the board or something like that that seems slightly different. He also says on his stream. I've mentioned this one a lot because I just rewatch it. His January 13th, 2021 stream. I recommend everyone just watch it.

It looks like Dun Oak remembered his basic manners. And we are ready to launch a new poll to see is Richard Newton cooler than Darth Vader. I'm curious. Is Darth Vader cool? I was literally going to ask. I thought maybe there was some background to why the Darth Vader selection. But I'm a man of the people provided that the people are respectful. So I'm going to ask the question. Anyways, the poll is open. Let us know if Newton is cooler than Darth Vader. That's tough, man. Like, Newton, I got to be honest, man. Like I genuinely think you're an incredible person. But Darth Vader, you know, like the force, he nuked Luke Skywalker's arm. Like that's, have you cut a dude's arm off with the lightsaber? I guess we could start there. Have not. No, I'm not talking about that.

What kind of collector Pokemon cards does Darth Vader have? And did you show us yet the ones your show me? We're going to take a look at those really quick. So we did pull a glacion so far. Check that one out, everybody. So that's a high variety of different Pokemon's. So we got the glacion one, which is over here, which is pretty exciting. So I thought that was pretty cool because we had talked last time and we talked about how EVs are favorite and your wife favorite. And then we basically immediately pulled out of, I don't know if it's a pack from the ones you got us because we've got kind of like a big old box of packs. I was going to ask what was well anyways, I'll ask you afterwards. I'm curious what was in those compared to the I don't know shit about Pokemon beyond when I played it on Game Boy advanced.

A giant win really for me, not so much for you guys, because for me it just means I get to talk about options, which we all know your boy can do. But let's do that. Do you want to pull those up and show people I do have to go in like 15 minutes if that's cool? Totally cool. So let me grab this. I'm curious what you can show us with GameStop options on your platform, because I just learned so much earlier. I found that to be so valuable. I'll do this.

Now, of no, if anybody has any questions on the options chain as we go through this, let me know there are some pieces missing like this isn't here for some reason. Typically, this would be here. This is all blank. So we're working with partial information. It looks like it seems like they're still updating it, but we have enough to work with, I think. Okay, sort of. So one of the things I was going to show you guys was the expiration volatility, which is actually kind of important. So for that, I'm going to grab a recent video that I did give me one sec just to kill the sound. It's going to be kind of like me inception, but in here, this was after the market closes and we look at the options chain right there. So you can still kind of see what this should be even though it's not populating. So what I noticed first is the primary explorations continue to maintain much higher volatility.

So what I noticed first is the primary explorations continue to maintain much higher volatility. So that doesn't inherently surprise me, but I do find it somewhat interesting where the volatility is centered. So in this case, the 19 July expiration is 139.5 vault. The following expiration goes down to 127 then down again to 120. So right now the market is pricing in more activity here in this expiration cycle, essentially compared to anything else in the options chains so far. So this is not highly novel based on what I've seen so far as I've been following GameStop essentially from the end of April into May, but nonetheless, I think is noteworthy at least in terms of trying to track where things are happening. So that's the first note. And a quick note on what this means in case anybody doesn't know, the implied volatility here, implied volatility like we talked about, this is what the market is pricing fall at and we're just kind of pulling it out. And it's just a projection of expected volatility, which is just movement. How much do we think something's going to move? If it has a higher percentage, it means that we're expecting it to move more than other things. You will notice, however, that some of these with lower percentages like this one out here",

That's all. So you're showing the rest screen right now, Eric. I can't. I don't know if I'm seeing what you're pointing at right now. It looks like I'm not, which is really fortunate that you told me that because there we go. This one. There is a sellover. Yep. So this is just me inception. So what I'm in it's kind of blurry. I don't know how easy it is for you guys to see. But what I'm showing you is that the expiration volatility for 19 July is high on a relative basis to everything else around it. So that just means the market is expecting movement is the punchline. And then the other thing I was explaining to people because I've seen a series of questions about, well, why is the expected move? That's what's within the parentheses is the dollar move. And then out here is the implied volatility. So the question I've seen is why is it that this has a lower IV, but a higher expected dollar move. And the reason for that is because",

So even though this has a higher implied volatility, it's relative to a seven day period as compared to 30 whatever day period. So just to clear that up for some folks. So the first thing I do notice is interesting volatility. It's not sky high. And again, this is not what we saw back in May. Back in this was like in the 200s, 300s, it was astronomically high. So I think it's worth pointing out a differentiation there. Now going back to the platform. Could I have anything to do with the idea of leading into earnings because earnings was due for early June? It's a good question. The expiration cycle that would contain that earnings release would have relatively higher implied volatility, but it would be the cycle that made that offers exposure to the earnings release. Yeah. So right now, what I see for open interest is there definitely is still pretty heavy call skew in terms of OI, more calls than puts. We've seen this pretty persistently now. This is a lower gap than we've seen. So I think that is interesting to me. Now",

This is the busy one. And you can see the next cycle that is most active is this 16 August. And again, this will line up very beautifully with the primary option, expiration. This is literally, it's for liquidity. If you're going through and you're trying to trade options, the standard expiration, especially in something like GameStop, are going to be more liquid. So people that are looking to put on bigger positions will go out into these expiration cycles. The other thing I'll show you quick is volume from a call perspective is much higher than call side than put side. So we are seeing still a lot of transactions and building. However, there are a pretty noteworthy amount of puts going on as well for 19 July. So all of this boils down to we are going through and building out very clearly this expiration cycle. That's essentially what a bull is down to. So a question. Yeah, man, of course. So a bullish trade, a bullish trade would be selling cash to your puts, right?",

Yeah, man, of course. So a bullish trade, a bullish trade would be selling cash to your puts, right? So that would show up in the oh, I for puts, right? It would. Now we can detect how the market is leaning as they're establishing their put positions and I can show you how very quickly we go back to this one and let's go back to GameStop and then we'll look at like the last week. Yeah. So what I can do is I can look at the put side and I can look for put transactions that occur at a specific spot. We can determine if the option was opened via buying the option or selling the option if it transacts at the bid or the offer. So in this case, if I want to see if people are putting on a bullish variation of a put meaning selling puts, I can see the transactions that occur at or below the bid. So this is how I can isolate if we're selling or buying puts. Now I want to be very clear, this is still a kind of swag. This is still an assessment. It doesn't mean definitively. It just means the overwhelming probability is that being the case. So that's why we classify them as this.",

I just, I think it's important to decipher for people the things that we can conclusively say for sure versus the things that we're taking as good of an educated guest. But this one is as close as you can get to something that's probably affirmative without it being 100 affirmative. So most of the put activity that we see that occurs at the bid or below for the last week, relatively small positions. The biggest ones we see are at the 125's and their 100,000 positions combined. This looks like the same trade to me because it occurred so close to one another. And what this looks like is they submitted this initial order and then they moved it. But this is all the way out in 2026. So hard to tell what this person is attempting to do. If we limit this to the 19 July op-ex, something a little more current, we see some transactions coming through here. But none of them are even over 100,000. Like the bulk of this is probably less than 500,000. Easy. So not a ton of put selling going on. Now the other thing we can do quickly is to take",

Now the other thing we can do quickly is to take a look at this theory about using calls, maybe roaring kiddie is selling calls, right, as part of against the shares to try to generate some sort of profit. And when I look at the overall transaction volume for the call side, specifically with those kinds of orders, which would be calls that are happening at the bid or below, that would tell us that we're selling. There's some positions coming through, but they're not massive either. So the total premium being pulled in here is not, it's not crazy large. Now the other thing I wanted to do before you have to jump while we have a couple minutes is actually go back to this and we can model roaring kiddie's position and we can actually see what he could have made. I think that would be fun. Okay. Yep. So yeah. Yeah. So we're postulating that this would have happened. I'm sorry, remind me again, the date window that we think it would be.

Or is this the idea that this occurred back in the beginning of May? Let's do the game stop position. Okay. And, but did we, was one of your ideas that he used, he was trading game stop to create enough capital to then roll into something else? Was that the idea from before? I don't, I have zero idea how he could have built the chewy position. I really don't know. Because I thought that's a mystery to me. Okay. Because I thought one of the things we wanted to look at is the probability of him being able to turn the, yeah, he only had like five million dollars or so. Or he, because his last yellow update yet 3.6 million. So I'm just saying let's round it to five and give him the benefit of the doubt. So if he starts, if he's got five million five million bucks on April 24th, and could he have turned that in three weeks into the 170 million dollars or so that he needs to buy all those files and shares?

So what we can do really quick is just kind of simulate this. We can go back into on demand. I don't know how well this is going to work with the platform where it's at and it's life right now, but we will see. So I'm going back to the 24th of April of 2024. And we are going to take a peekaboo at these options. And I'm, what I'm going to do is build a highly advantageous position for him to see if this, how this falls within the realm of possibility essentially. So we know from 24 April to 15 May, what was the high, what day occurred that posted the high end stock price? The high was the 14th, but he could have bought weekly's. He could have bought and made an enormous profit buying X-ray for the third or X-ray for the 10th and done extremely well. Okay. Yeah.

It was like, I don't remember 64, 63. That's where it's. So let's say that he bought maybe these 15s. So these are a 13 delta and they're trading for 18 cents. Again, like we kind of know he didn't do this because I can't, I would have seen the volume come through for this, especially to put on a position this far out, but just to see even what's within the realm of possibility. So we have 5 million divided by 18 that tells me he could put on 277,000 contracts, seven, seven, seven. So that's the position we're looking at. Two, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven. The reason why I'm using these options is being most advantageous to him is because even though there were really low delta, we know there's a giant move that occurs in this time frame. So this would give you an idea of what the compounding could look like if essentially we built a, again, near perfect position relative to the period that we know. So this comes in as you could",

And then we can just see what these options traded at and then we can see what his PL would have looked like. Okay. So this would give him essentially a billion dollars if he, if he ticked it that way. So yeah. So if in the like most optimal scenario was able to put on a position like this in some degree, then it is entirely possible that he could have scooped up the capital to do this. Now again, we can kind of steal man the argument to a degree by changing what we're looking at really quick, going back to unusual whales. We can go back into GameStop and we can look at this time frame again, 14 May. You'd want to look specifically, I think, at two windows. The 24th 25th and 26th for big purchases of calls.

Because those may 17th salt print it. Yeah, I'm using the, yeah, so I included both of those up here. Okay. Yeah, so if we use both of those expressions just to clean this up a little bit.

So he would have been way over if he did all of this. So then let's just give him credit then for 3.6 million, worth. And then if we look at the average price just kind of buy eyeball, I see let's call it probably close to two. So I was going to say, yeah, we'll call it two. So let's say 3.6 million dollars divided by two, is 18,000. So essentially, we're not fully calculating correct based on the average price. I think we're low-balling it a little too much.

What if he built his position on May 1st, 2nd and 3rd? You want to look at the 30th? Yeah, let's look at purchases there. Let's take a look at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd. May 1st, 2nd, 3rd.

So if we look at the total size there, just to again, eyeball it, I see 1637, you see 1067, I see 85. And I see 959. To find any other big 17s here. So it doesn't look like blocks here, right? During this period of time? No. But there were blocks in that earlier period of time. So he could have held those all the way up into the 14th I suppose, right? The ones we've built up before. Yeah. And we can see what those would have been worth there. Yeah, then maybe he didn't do two periods of buying. Because yeah, that other one it just, it doesn't really seem on brand branches. What would these be worth? My knowledge. Take a peek of boo. 11,000 of them. We can even guide this down. Let's just call it too. Give them the bigger benefit of the doubt. 19 mil 19.6. See that's not nearly enough though. He needs to build hundreds of millions of dollars. Right. That's that's what I was saying, like what the response is from before. It's why I'm fairly skeptical of turning the 3 million into that. Like even if we give them like in this case, I'm giving them a perfect bill to doubt. Yeah. So I mean, even if we size this up,",

So I mean, even if we size this up, let's say he scooped the 18,000 corresponding size, which that's more than what even traded there. But that would get him to just 32 mil. Yeah, it just seemed like so, you know, questions as we kind of wrap up the stream here. Yeah. Where did he possibly come up with 170 million to pick up 4.2 million shares? We don't know when he picked up those 4.2 million shares at all, right? It was first 4.2 million on top of the 100,000 he had. We do know when he bought his 20s. So that's we know he had to have had 60 some odd million, 65 million dollars during the share offering to buy all those 20s. Where did he get all this money? I think there are two solutions. I can think of that are the simplest ones. The first one is he has money in another account somewhere. I think the solution beyond that is that he unwound some of his game stock position to acquire. That's the second idea. Yeah, because I like that that was like my biggest question as well, is I was trying to conceive of what like it's not. It's not a",

Yeah, because I like that that was like my biggest question as well, is I was trying to conceive of what like it's not. It's not a small amount of money. That's not easy to generate that amount of capital. Yeah. So because that's basically what is Andrew Citroen capital. What's his name Andrew left? Yeah. He keeps asking the same question. The media is asking the same question. Good question. It's a fantastic question. Because like do I think that maybe he has money in another account potentially? Sure. That's possible. Is it a hundred million dollars on top of the hundred million, 60 or whatever he had in his primary account? Could be. But like that's I don't know. That seems like a ton to me. I was thinking more that he might be siphoning out like 20 million maybe. Something like that that I think could be conceivable for somebody like him that would set up his family for life. But yeah, it's to me that the the simplest would be unwinding some of the games that position. But to your point, I would find it really hard to believe that he would go through the effort of accumulating 9 million 1,000 shares to then unwind it.

And would he potentially build that position to essentially send the message to Ryan Cohen high five of them and then do something else? Not impossible either. Yeah. So if you think about it based on what we looked at, what is your best guess on where the capital came from? Well, there's the curiosity too that is my share is my screen sharing right now. It is. So a curiosity pointed out is right here, which is between these two updates. This one on June 3rd. Look at this cash position here. 29.2 mil. Yeah. And then it goes up. It ticks up. And this is going to be interest earned on the end of end of May. It's pretty obvious. But the the E trade accounts for high for over having over a million dollars in your account only earns you 0.15. The disrespect. Right. It doesn't earn you five and a half percent like your money market's going to yield you or something else. And you'll unless you put it you have to specifically put it into that vehicle. It's in this right here. My understanding is it's going to earn 0.15. So if we",

So I'm going to do 29 409. And then we take away 29. 276. In the meantime, Brad says a guy who loves trading is quite good at it. For three years wasn't trading. His large cash reserve built up for this. I agree with Brad's idea there. Again, I think the only crux to that idea is if he was being honest during that live stream, which I would that's again, I take him at his word. He's saying that that's his account and that's his cash. So we're working under the assumption of that being the case. But to your point, the wild card is kind of what Newton and I were recently talking about the fact that this could be money from somewhere else.

That's all working out correctly. But that makes sense. He would have had to have a bunch of money in there. I know people are saying he would have had to have a billion. Am I doing the math here wrong? So here's a billion dollars. If he was earning a yield of 0.00 or this would be 1 yield. But each rate only pays 0.15 yield. He would have got a huge difference at the end of the month. So I don't see evidence of him having a billion dollars in the account unless I'm doing something here. Yeah. Yep. I agree with you. So he had... I still think that you would have seen it in the cash anyways. But he would have had in May, 90 million maybe to play with. Yeah. And that I think makes sense at the start of this, right? Because he came into this whole May move with a big bankroll.

But we got the cash here. How much did the options cost? Like 65? So that's like the perfect amount. He just probably just rolled right into this. With the money to throw down on the options. So he probably came into this with the shares already. Yeah. I think that that's fair. Because also we can see, well, I don't know if he had the shares because the price of 21274. Well, he could have bought those and actually his cost basis were going way over that 15 minutes. I said that, but the cost basis on those guys should have been if he held his previous existing shares, these guys, they had a cost basis of 1379. His new ones had a cost basis of 2127. Yep.
