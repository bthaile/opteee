    "text": "As a trader, you got to figure out what fits with you as an individual. This is something that takes a while to figure out, because trading starts with figuring out how to find ways to monetize the market. You got to create your own edge. You got to find effects, market forces, profit mechanisms that you can make money from. Then you have to go through that entire list of stuff you find and figure out what fits with you as a human being, the way you think, the way you behave. Do you like taking a lot of risk or are you scared of risk? Do you like going through a lot of positions in having higher turn or do you like looking at your portfolio once a quarter? Part of your job as a trader is to identify your own tendencies so that you can match the kinds of systems that you're building so that they naturally blend together versus forcing something that doesn't work because you will find out it'll be poor results, be an outlier, see you later.",
