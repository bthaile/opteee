    "text": "The Greeks are seemingly confusing but really simple. And once you know how to use them, they become second nature to help you build smarter trades. The goal of this video is to walk you through a step-by-step process on how you can default on what makes the most sense based on what you're trying to do for an individual trade so that the Greeks seem way less overwhelming. And this is stuff that you can quite literally practically apply whenever you feel like it. The way to think about the Greeks is they're like the instrument cluster to your car. It gives you a lot of information. It tells you if your car is running high and potentially going to overheat. It tells you if your oil pressure is good, if your oil temperature is good, so on and so forth. That is exactly what the Greeks do. So they can seem overwhelming but really they just give you information on how an option or grouping of options known as a structure or strategy is going to behave. So let's talk about basics here. Now I have a video that goes pretty deep into detail on the Greeks. So I'm going to spend very little time on the basics. And I want to speak more so from the practical application of using them to build smarter trades. But for those that need a reminder on the basics, you can gloss over this very quickly. And you will be essentially",

But for those that need a reminder on the basics, you can gloss over this very quickly. And you will be essentially caught up. Now one admin note is that these are what we consider the primary Greeks. Some of them would call these the first order Greeks, but really they're not because gamma is not a first order Greek. It's a second order Greek, which is a nerdy cocktail party fun fact that nobody cares about, but you should know. The way to think about first order, second order, third order simply pertains to what does the Greek measure. Notice how for delta, theta, Vega, row, it has everything to do with premium rates of change relative to something pertaining to the option. Notice how gamma is not the premium rate of change, but the delta rate of change. So second order Greeks tell us how some of the other Greeks might behave given movements. Now from a retail trading perspective, you don't really need to care that much about it. If you're curious, I actually built a chart in this other video that I'll link to below that goes through all of the different orders of Greeks. There's even more than this technically, but you can go beyond third order Greeks talking about things like color speed, ultimate, zama, it",

But for the general person, you don't need more than this. Now you do need to know some of the general traits of the primary Greeks. Notice how row is not on here and that's because interest rates do not tend to move that much. The way to think about row is when you're in interest rate sensitive environments like we are now, it becomes a little more topical, but in general, the risk-free rate relative to in options expiration is generally pretty static. So let's first eyeball how delta behaves across different expirations. Do you notice how on this 31 DTE, which is the white line compared to the 325 DTE? Do you notice how the white line is actually quite steep for the at the money's and as well as the further out of the money? That is everything to do with what is happening to delta as you get closer to expiration. If an option is out of the money, the delta is going to approximate to zero. We can take a look at that in something like Nvidia. Let's take a look at this zero DTE option chain. Notice how the out",

Let's take a look at this zero DTE option chain. Notice how the out of the money options are literally at zero and these ones that are showing one, these will be zero. And the options that are in the money will have a delta of one. So as time passes, a delta has to approximate to one of those two states and only one of those two states, one or a zero. That's why you'll see it gets steeper over time. This matters a lot because it's going to impact the way that your trades might behave. So say for example, that we're holding in out of the money option in something like Nvidia. And let's say that we started with something that was seven days to expiration and we bought something that was like a 10 delta. And this is again seven days to go. Well, as time passes, unless this option moves closer and closer to the money, this is actually going to lose delta. And again, you can see that reflected here because that same option that we were just looking at the 10 delta, which is a 124 strike. If we take a look at the 124 strike with zero DTEs, this is zero.

If we take a look at the 124 strike with zero DTEs, this is zero. So that's one of the issues with really short duration out of the money options is they're actively losing delta. You have to be aware of that. So if we look at theta, the main thing to know for theta is that it decays as a rate higher as you get closer to expiration and it really starts to pick up once you're 60 DTE. Now there are nuances to this because if you have an option that is at the money where there's more extrinsic value versus an option that's really deep in or out of the money where there's less extrinsic value, it'll be a little bit lower. Gamma ramps up as we get closer to expiration because again, we just talked about this with delta. Delta has to make a choice. And gamma measures the rate of change of delta. So this is important because of some of the trades will talk about with building trades with respect to gamma. And then Vega, you'll notice is typically more elevated the further out in time we go because Vega operates in the extrinsic value of an option.

So this means that if you're trying to trade something related to the volatility expansion of an option, you might actually want to go slightly further out of the money because it will have a bigger impact provided that the impact of implied volatility is relative to that time frame. So I want to fast forward to this. This is really a checklist that you can use to help think through how to use these. And I want to use some examples with you. So let's take a look at delta. And let's take a look at delta in a vacuum. Delta is agnostic to time frame, meaning if I go out 500 days, these will still have all different kinds of delta. They'll be skewed differently. This is because of volatility. You don't necessarily go super far in detail on that. But you'll notice that the at the money for the strike, the one thirty four is actually sixty six delta. So, but you'll notice that delta is whatever it is. This is one of the reasons why if you're buying options a lot of times it can make sense to go further out in time because we're decreasing the amount of delta decay that we're experiencing.

So that means that if I buy something that has a higher delta, it's going to move closer dollar for dollar move in the underlying while mitigating some other factors that we'll talk about. One of the downsides to this, though, is your gamma will be lower. So let's say that you're trying to buy cheaper options that have the ability to compound way more. If I go to seven days to expiration and I take a look at the gamma for these for the at the money is there five and the out of the money is there's two, three and four. If I look at that same thing 70 days out, notice how the gamma is essentially a one or two much, much lower. So what that tells you is the further out in time you go, the lower your gamma inherently is going to be and that means that the rate of change of your delta will be slower.

If I'm trying to trade a short term movement, I might go a little near term and pick something that might rapidly compound because of a very high gamma because if we think about the time value of options going back to this little graph is they're very DTE sensitive and there's two ways we need to look at theta. We can track it as theta itself, but we can look in a gross manner and a relative manner and I'll show you what that means. So options that have longer days to expiration will naturally have more theta and let's go out to these 280 DTs and we take a look at theta, you'll see that for the in the money's it's three cents, four cents, five cents for the at the money's and then goes back down for the out of the money. So that means every single day on these options for the at the money's they're going to lose about five dollars. That's their theta 280 days out.

If I come in here to 35 days out, you'll notice that theta is six cents and cents 11 cents for the at the money. So it's about double. It's very, very high and then you'll notice something interesting. If I go into the 70TE and we take a look at theta, you'll notice that it's super, super high. We have 23 cents. That's because these are decaying away literally today into whatever they're going to be. So all of this value has to bleed out. And then if we go really close data expiration and this is using zero, but you can use even closer than this, you can actually find that theta will slow down and on a relative basis. Let's take a look at spikes. This will have more expiration so that you can kind of see what I'm talking about. If I look at seven days to expiration, my theta for an at the money's about 33 cents. If I look at a 3DTE and I look at my theta for an at the money, it's about 23 cents. Why is it less? Well, it's because as you get really close in time, there's less overall extrinsic value to come out. But if you look at 23 cents relative to something that is worth a dollar and you compare that to something that's this is",

But if you look at 23 cents relative to something that is worth a dollar and you compare that to something that's this is 24 cents against something that's 2.80. Even though this can be lower at times on a relative basis, it's huge. This is about a quarter of the remaining value, whereas this is not quite. And I realized before I think I said 33, I meant to say 24 for the theta value. So that's the difference here. And if we go further out in time to 35 DTE, notice the theta here is only 14. So overall amount of theta will be much more, but you're losing less of it on a daily basis. And this will continue as you go further and further out in time. If we go 280 days out, there's way more overall theta, but you're losing less of it on a per day basis. It's kind of like a down payment to something. So if I were to summarize those main points for you and we already talked about Vega, I don't think we have to go super far into it because I don't think traders often are trying to isolate Vega specifically. But for those options traders that are, you should refer to this plot. So if you're trying to trade the expansion or",

But for those options traders that are, you should refer to this plot. So if you're trying to trade the expansion or contraction of volatility of something, we need to pay attention to Vega, but you can see most of it from what I just showed you. So if we come in here and we take a look at Vega for the at the money, these are 21, 19, 16, something like that. And then if I go out here to the 35s, Vega for these is 74. And then if I go out to these that are 70, they're a dollar four. And that's because Vega operates in the extrinsic value of an option. So if there's more extrinsic value, there's a larger Vega impact. Now again, this can be done as a gross value or a relative value as a gross value, a dollar four on something that's 15 is a different ratio than something that's 33 cents on something that's 280 and change. So the way to think about a lot of these metrics, theta, Vega, they're relative to the time frame, but then they're also relative to the total premium of an option. So here's the cliff note summary.

If I buy an option that is a higher delta, it's going to be more expensive, but it's going to move closer for a dollar for dollar move in the underlying. It's also going to compound less. What that means is this one delta, there's no compounding value. It's going to move one dollar for each dollar move in the underlying. And it's going to be more expensive as compared to something that might be cheaper that I can buy more of that starts at a 30 delta, but for each one dollar move in the underlying, it's going to gain five delta's. And then after another dollar move in the underlying, it's going to gain six delta's. So it compounds very, very quickly. So the trade off here is higher delta, moves better dollar for dollar, lower delta, depending on whatever gamma is, lower delta will be cheaper, but you can buy more of them. And then for gamma, we just naturally hit on some of that. Gamma is going to be higher the closer you are in time, which if you're correct, will allow you to compound faster if you're buying your option. But if you're wrong, your option is going to decay from delta decay as we get closer to expiration. So you can strike a",

But if you're wrong, your option is going to decay from delta decay as we get closer to expiration. So you can strike a balance between these based on what kind of risk profile you're trying to achieve in your option. Now for theta, if you use, let's say, long options and you buy something that seven days to expiration, your theta as a gross value might be less, but as a percentage of what you bought into is going to be way more. The reason why this matters is because then as your 24 cents decays away from these 2.80 call options, well, that means that even if you get your dollar move and get 52 cents out of the delta, you're essentially paying 24 cents of that or 24 to counteract your theta decay. Now, if you go further out in time to avoid that, you're going to pay a larger gross amount. But you're going to get less gamma, you're going to get less of a compounding effect. So this is why for a lot of buying strategies, I prefer to going a little further out in time and at the money slash a little bit deeper in the money, typically targeting around a 70 delta.

But this is a shorter fused trade. I need to be correct in a timely manner. Now, if I'm selling premium, I don't want to come super far in time because if I do that, even though I collect a higher amount of theta relative to the price of the option, I'm experiencing a lot of gamma to get it. Whereas if I pick something that's further out in time to sell and I might get, let's say, here I might only get 10 a day or something like that, but I'm cutting my gamma down a lot.
