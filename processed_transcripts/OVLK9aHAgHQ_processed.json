    "text": "Let's start with the hot take. The perfect options trade is not about whether or not the trade itself makes money. I know. Actually, the annoying part here is some of the worst possible trades make money. So what is the perfect options trade? That's what we're going to talk about. So the thing to keep in mind is a good trade is not about luck. It's about precision. It's about timing. And we're going to talk about those two concepts along with how we structure a trade. What's up, everyone? Eric here. Welcome back to the outliers. Let's get right in. So we're going to talk about a few principles. Then I'm going to go through this thing. I call the big four trade process. And then I'm going to walk you through specific decisions that have to be made in order to ensure the perfect options trade is placed. So the very first principle I'm going to introduce you to is this idea of stacking strength. When we're looking for trades, it's common for us to see something that looks generally appealing and then to immediately try to figure out how to put a trade on in it. Let's take a look at an example. If we pop over to the platform, pop into a scan, let's take a look at this LIN. I'm looking for stocks that are near 52 week highs. That's all. And let's say we want to trade a bullish thesis for whatever reason.",

And let's say we want to trade a bullish thesis for whatever reason. Do I like this for a bullish thesis? Well, if I look across the six month time frame, it's going up. That looks OK. And then if I look in on a three month time frame, it's going generally up. That's also OK. And if I look in on a 30 day, it starts to flatten out a little bit. Some of this is going to have to align with your timing, your trading window that you're pursuing. Well, let's take a look at something in comparison like XLC. If I want to trade something to the upside, this looks OK. It's definitely moving up. It doesn't have that big pullback like you're seeing in the LIN stock that we were just looking at. What I'm highlighting is we have to come up with multiple factors. So the idea of stacking strength is to look at multiple factors all together in conjunction, but not looking at one specific element and making a decision off of that one element. It's a common mistake. The other thing that we already discussed is that the perfect options trade is not outcome based. It's not whether or not you make money. The ultimate objective",

The other thing that we already discussed is that the perfect options trade is not outcome based. It's not whether or not you make money. The ultimate objective is to make money. But you have to remember, there will be some traders that are insanely lucky. And they have one trade that makes them a ton of money. And they're off to the races. They've made all their money. They're good. That's not the case for most people. There's a healthy dose of luck that leads to that style of outcome. So when we're looking at the path for most of us, is we're going to have to trade a lot. We're going to have to do it a lot over time. That's the idea of making sure that we're not so focused on the outcome of an individual trade so that we're breaking all our rules, doing things we know we shouldn't, like letting losers get too big, hoping that it turns around, taking winning trades down too fast, all these different kinds of things. And we focus on, are we putting on trades that follow our plan and our system? That's the objective. Now, that entire concept is predicated on having a system that you're confident in.

Because one of the most common reasons for somebody to break a plan is that they don't trust the plan. Why would you follow a plan that you don't trust? Does it make any sense? So the work in trading is done in building a plan that you trust. That's where all the rigor goes. So if we have a plan that we trust and we understand that we're not so concerned about the outcome of any one individual trade because we trust the plan and over time it leads to profitable results, then it's easier to focus on this key principle of focusing on making sure that we're putting on trades that align with our plan and are not over emphasizing the outcome of any one individual trade. The last general principle is looking for nodes. I find traders in general, they go through this process and essentially they're trying to come up with different ways to make something make sense to put it on. I look at it in the inverse. I want to look for things that as I go through my screening criteria that there's no logical reason for me to not place the trade. I find a lot of traders are trying to find an excuse.

I find a lot of traders are trying to find an excuse. Something is in this steep, sharp decline and they're like, well, it might turn around. I want to get in now or it might go lower. Who really knows? But the idea of trying to build a trade premise off of essentially confirmation bias, trying to see the things that you want to see for something to go up is a terrible, terrible habit. So I flip that on its head and I look for reasons to say no. And if there are too many reasons that lead me or that lead to no, then it's no trade. That's simple. Let's talk about the big four trade process. This is in a couple different videos, so I'm going to gloss over this quickly. But when we're placing the perfect options trade in my opinion, it follows this exact process. We're going to start by assessing portfolio fit. Is this something? Are we looking for something that fits a specific need for our portfolio? Do we need long delta, short delta, is do we need theta? Do we need more gamma? Whatever it is? Or are we simply looking for opportunities? This origin matters a lot because for example, if I'm looking for a trade, I need long delta",

This origin matters a lot because for example, if I'm looking for a trade, I need long delta is in my portfolio, but then I come across this really great short delta trade. It might look like a great trade, but if it doesn't fit the portfolio, it doesn't fit the portfolio. So this is the foundation for then looking and identifying things that makes sense. So the next part is clearly articulating the profit mechanism in the corresponding signals for that trade. So we're going through this process, we're trying to stack strength, we're not focused on the outcome too much, we're focused on the process, we're ready to look for nose, we're going through our portfolio and we find, eh, we don't really need anything, anything that looks really good to us looks good to us. So then we start scanning. We look for things that look appealing and we find something that catches our eye. For example, let's take a look at Redfin. Redfin's been going down, maybe this is a short thesis. We think that this is something that's going to go down.

Well, depending on the time frame that we think it might go down, the very first thing I noticed is that on a three month standard deviation channel, it's actually upward sloping. That's not tremendously bearish to me. So then if I zoom in a little bit further, I go to 30 days, it's still upward sloping. So unless I'm looking to trade a really, really short term thesis, like this is a five day, five minute, all of a sudden it's definitely downward sloping. So if it's a really short term thesis, maybe it makes sense. But when I'm looking for technical analysis, I typically wanted to find the time frame I'm trying to trade and then look at one up, one down in terms of the aggregation period. So if I'm trading something that's super short term, like maybe a couple days, well, then sure, I can use the five day, 15 minute, then I could maybe use a shorter term time frame, a one day, five minute and see how the overall strength or weakness is shaping up. And then I can do something a little bit longer term a few weeks or a month and see how it looks in that period.

And it's an objective no in terms of alignment across all these different time frames. Does that mean that there's no trade potential? No, there still could be, but it's something I have to take into consideration as I evaluate this against other opportunities. The profit mechanism in that case is very, very clear. It's short term bearish direction. It's a continuation of a trend. So then understanding the profit mechanism in the signals allows me to do this next step, which is build the trade. I'm going to build a trade that makes sense off of these things. So for example, if I'm trading something that's bearish direction, it naturally funnels me into a couple strategies, maybe sure calls, long puts, and then depending on what I think the potential price activity looks like for that underlying. So for example, if we go back and let's say that I think that the potential here is there is potential for a massive move for whatever reason. Let's just say I think that to be the case.

    "text": "if we go back and let's say that I think that the potential here is there is potential for a massive move for whatever reason. Let's just say I think that to be the case. If I think that as the case and there's a massive move, well, then what I prefer short calls or long puts, I would prefer long puts because I have uncapped profit potential. So if you follow this kind of process, you're making sure everything is in alignment. And then the last step here is just to make sure that we have an after action review. This is where we look through and we already know that information and details we want to collect to make sure that we are following our plan, to make sure that the plan is good, to make sure that the plan makes sense. All of those get captured and tracked in the AAR. So what are the decisions that have to be made? Really simple. It's this list here. We run through all of these different key decisions as we're deciding what exactly the trade should behave in terms of our interaction with it over the lifecycle. And that's what leads to the perfect options trade. It's something that's completely aligned with our portfolio that we clearly articulate the profit mechanisms as signals that we build a trade based on a strategy that we have a plan for and tested and we know it works.

It's something that's completely aligned with our portfolio that we clearly articulate the profit mechanisms as signals that we build a trade based on a strategy that we have a plan for and tested and we know it works. And then we have a plan to integrate all of the data into an after action review so that we can track what worked well, what didn't work well and modify our systems as needed going forward. We're going to stack strength. We're not going to focus on the outcome of individual trades to heavily. We're not going to sit there and break all our rules to try to salvage an individual trade. We're going to look for nose and we're going to find opportunities that look so good that we can't say no. This is the perfect options trade in my view. This is not talking about a trade that just automatically goes your direction and looks beautiful the whole time. It's not about whether or not the trade makes money. It's about following a process that we know yields positive, expected return over time and continuing to do that. Be an outlier. See you all later.",
