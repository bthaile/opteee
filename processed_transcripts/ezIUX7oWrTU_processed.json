    "text": "you you you you you you you you you what outliers. Happy Friday. So we recently wrapped up a pretty big series actually that talked about trading options in a slightly different way. And I introduced it as kind of the outlier approach to trading options. And the goal of that is to try and help people think differently about options because options really can be used in a lot of different ways. And I think that they're widely misunderstood. I just did a first, I had a jolly rancher in my mouth, but I didn't want it sloshing around while I was talking. So I just swallowed it whole. I don't know if anybody's ever done that before. Hasted fine, but it's a life choice. Now the plan was to talk with you all to figure out what we wanted to focus on next. And I didn't make it up for you. I literally asked you. So if we take a look, we can see the community post. And I essentially said here are a few ideas. I wouldn't say it's limited to these ideas, but here's a few choices. And you can see that there's 38 voted for surviving, options trading with a 5K account. And then a very close second was a deep dive into my strategies, which will actually kind of be able to do a little bit of both. Because this won't apply like my strategies definitely won't apply to a 5K account, but the",

Because this won't apply like my strategies definitely won't apply to a 5K account, but the concepts of those strategies will. So that's the goal. Now I'm viewing this very first episode of this, more so as an orientation and a conversation with you. It's this is designed to be a back-and-forth dialogue. Because I have a rough idea on what I want to cover across eight episodes. So it'll be about two months. But I want to make sure that what I kind of thinking of is still applicable to you. And it's the stuff that genuinely addresses your concerns, the struggles that you have for those that specifically voted, or not even necessarily have a 5K account, but folks that are just interested in that as a topic, whether regardless of the amount of capital you have. So what I thought would be a great beginning point here, hey, what up Lauren, good to see you. I thought what a great beginning point would be is to brainstorm a little bit, have like an actual conversation and to track ideas. So I'm actually grabbing the very first page of this. And I want to open with a question, which is in the context of trading a 5,000 account, what is your largest pain point?",

The reason I'm asking this is because what I'm going to do is literally make sure that every single one of the things that we come up with together are going to be addressed across the series. And then I'm going to add a couple on as we go through if you guys hit them or don't hit them. But I don't want to start by giving you what I think I would rather start with what you think and then layer on on top. So in the chat, please give me some ideas. Again, whether you personally identify with it or not doesn't actually matter that much. The way I want to approach this is just in general. If you were to think about trading options with a 5K account, what are the largest pain points you could conceive of, whether they're your own, whether there's something that you've experienced previously, but don't anymore, which is great. Or if there's something that you really haven't experienced, but maybe you've seen somebody else experience, that kind of thing.

Lauren says mine was making small trades that didn't make much or lose much. I like that. So I guess that one gives me a couple ideas actually. So for Lauren, your idea gives me two. It gives me something like dollar return expectations. I think that's a fair one. And then there's also sizing trades relative to the portfolio. Which I love that. Zach says, based off the balance, it's a cash account. So if you're thinking day trades would have to wait for cash to settle. That's a great one. So and to be honest, I'm actually really glad you brought that up because the concept of pattern day trading really has generally left my sphere. And I'm not saying that like, oh, look at me. I'm not subject to it. It's not that at all. I actually say it more is like it, it, it's a bit of guilt because I should be more plugged into like what most people are going through. So for me, I don't, I literally don't even fucking think about it. I have no idea. It's like when I, when I pay for gas, I couldn't tell you how much gas is. I know it's expensive in California, but I have no idea what it",

It's like those kinds of things where like I identify that I've become a little too detached and part of it is like I want to get back. So that's actually a really like really great point. The idea of PDT restrictions. What else can you guys come up with? See 23 folks in here. So do not be shy. The again, the thing is the more you guys give me here, the more personalized it will be for you. Whereas if I'm left to my own devices, I might come up with a bunch of shit that everybody hates. Hopefully not, but it could be. That could happen. Each says how to assess and deal with the trade-offs of account size introduces to one's use of profit mechanisms. When to size up and use defined risk versus smaller undefined positions would be one. That's a really good one. So it's kind of like understanding trade-offs with a small account versus large account. And then there's a second one in there as well, which is kind of directly tied to profit mechanisms. So how call it like profit mechanisms accessible and inaccessible? Small account.",

This one, by the way, this one is a motherfucker. That's why it's in there. That one is a pain in the ass to deal with. That's a really, really good one. Lauren says I had a question about different accounts. I only get three day trades in a week and I kept running out. Oh, interesting. Yeah, that sucks. PDT. PDT is in bad, in my opinion. I don't like regulation in the fact that like if somebody wants to light their money on fire, they should be allowed to light their money on fire. But so I don't like PD from that PDT from that sense. But I think a lot of traders look at PDT and they're like, oh man, pattern day trade. And this is out to get me. They're just trying to keep, they're trying to keep the little guy down. And it's like, it's kind of like require and seat belts. They're trying to keep you from fucking yourself up because the overwhelming majority of people go that way. So yeah. Moody Blues says limited choices in what stocks. I love that.

Zach says if you want to trade a Mag 7 in any sort of time, you're usually looking at one option, maybe two at the most. Same concept, which shares on higher price stocks. Yeah. So I also like that. So specific to Mag 7 access via options. And there's a bunch of stuff we can do for that actually. But it's a good one. Valerity says stock doing the opposites of what's needed immediately. After entry. Fun fact. Valery. That shit doesn't go away. That's always going to be there. So small account, big account, we all get kicked in the nuts. The same. And I am literally convinced that if you and I were on a phone call and we were like, yo, I'm going to put this one on you. Put the exact opposite on. The market will find a way to fuck us both near guaranteed near guaranteed. So I appreciate that as a point. We'll definitely talk about it. But this is this is our reality as traders.

Is it utilization of the portfolio? Is it trade sizes? Is it stuff like that? Because I can see a bunch of different angles and we'll talk about risk management actually pretty comprehensively. But if you have a specific tight stops and profit ratio, got it. Yeah. So risk reward ratios. Stop requirements. That's a good one. Dig that one. This is a good list. Okay.

Because there's some interesting stuff going on that beginner traders may or may not be paying attention to that I think are worth discussing. Random skate says I'd love to know more about stop loss and taking profits. Got it. Stop loss selection. And profit taking approach. Those are great. These will depend heavily on the trading approach, but there's absolutely stuff that we can do. Definitely stuff that we can do to manage it. So for me to add on a couple more, one of them is portfolio correlation. I think that's really difficult to manage because with a smaller portfolio, you're kind of stuck into some smaller names. Unless you do some other stuff, which we'll talk about. And a lot of times those smaller names can have pretty strong correlation. So then you're actually building a portfolio that might be a little more exposed than you might think. So that's one that I see a lot. The next one is strategy hopping. This is where I see traders.

Is that this one? Let's see. You want a bunch of research day trade and particularly scalping, scalping. That's one that we actually have to talk about. Now, back to this strategy, hopping thing that's worth talking about right now is traders have to be aware of things like path dependence. And they have to or parth dependence, if you prefer that one, they also have to be resistance to streaks. And then strategy development that goes into that. Scalping is bad. Okay. Next. Count",

This one's going to piss everybody off when we talk about that one. So I can't wait.

There's now this one has an underlying assumption BTDubs. If we're talking about trading with a 5K 5K account that we're probably talking about a smaller like a newer trader, I should say. But the thing that's worth emphasizing here is trading before understanding options. This is great. I love these. Now, if you have any other ideas that you think would be pain points with respect to trading a 5K account, please throw them in throughout the rest of the chat. That's totally cool.

But as I look at this, the overwhelming majority of you have more than 5K. So it makes me curious like why the fuck did we pick trading options with 5K or is it that the people that attend the live streams kind of get a sense of what the fuck they're doing so that they're not stuck with 5K and then the people that filled out that poll on YouTube might be the more aspirational group that's hoping to figure out how to learn but then they don't actually show up to learn. Maybe that's it. 88 of you. So then this does beg the question. Are we doing. Are we doing the right focus for the beginner series. H says I think it might be the latter to be honest. I kind of think it might be like I actually might think that could like I do think that might be the case. So then let me. Let me close this one. I'm actually now super curious and I'm going to launch another poll and in this poll I literally want to look at.

If there's typos it's because I ran out of space. It doesn't let you have that many words. So please take this poll. So this is the poll that I posted on YouTube that's effectively asking what topic do you want to focus on for the next eight episodes. I might still do this one, but I might condense it down from eight episodes and do like two episodes. And then depending on what the group picks here that actually shows up to the streams and I might pivot. This is so for those that don't know I did a lot of stats in my undergrad and grad.

Like I wouldn't expect that kind of variance between these because I also got rid of these two buckets. So it's only between these two. So the discrepancy between, yeah, the discrepancy between the count sizes there is kind of crazy. Okay. So this is deep dive into option strategies that's 15 votes, pretty clear majority.

As always, this is the fun part about what we do here is that like this little, this stuff is for you. Like literally for you.

So then what we're talking about here is not super relevant to everybody, although again, a lot of the concepts are. So then what I intend to do actually then we could literally just, we'll literally just work through this today together right now. We'll talk about this concept since we're here and we already listed this stuff out. And then the next one will literally start deep diving strategies. I think that would make sense. Jared says, I feel like profit mechanisms is a big part of the deep dive of your strategy. Sort of. Now when I explore deep diving strategies, I'm not going to go into the knit and wait detail.

That's one of the difficult parts with making content about trading is that in order to give you guys quality stuff, there's just so much to it. It's so funny. I literally recorded a video like two days ago and the video is about the basics of back testing. It was following an outlier pro stream where we talked about this. And I said, oh, let me just make a quick video that talks about literally the bare bones basics. That video is 23 fucking minutes long. The bare bone basics, like the absolute bare bones. So I'm seeing here, it's like there's just so much detail on this stuff. But yeah, well, we definitely will talk about profit mechanisms for sure. You have to, but not, not in super far detail.

Renem says, what would you say to someone that has 5K, but is only comfortable trading 500? Because they are new and not confident in their abilities, but are having fun making small trades and learning. I don't hate that. I don't hate that at all. I think that person would probably be better off paper trading for a little bit. I think then if they've paper traded for at least three months and they're enjoying that process, they're getting value out of that and then they decide to move it to production and go live with a small amount of money. That's cool. But the thing is, I really do believe not just practicing hard, but practice like you play. And one of the downsides is if you do that, the path to being comfortable trading in actual account becomes more difficult. And I'll show you why. So your brain is pretty neat. Does a lot of cool things. One of the things it does, though, that fails you is that it doesn't adequately measure losses and gains the same. It doesn't, these are not equal.

If I am a Neanderthal, which funny enough, I did a couple of those DNA tests and I have a disproportionate amount of Neanderthal, which makes sense because I'm a fucking idiot.

Which might look like a bow tie to some or like a pencil with a bow tie, but it's not. That's a Tomahawk. And if I have the choice between getting food, adequate amount of food, or if I have the choice of getting more food, I'm going to pick adequate food. Okay. So then if we progress to the next series and I have the adequate food, I have this. If I have the choice between keeping my four food cubes, or if I have the choice of gaining a food cube, however, at the outset or at the conclusion of this, I'm either going to lose my four food cubes or I'm going to gain the five food cubes on top and get to nine food cubes.

I don't view these the same. And it's because if I have the four cubes, I survive. I live to fight another day. And I am still able to go continue living. The marginal gain of getting the extra five cubes doesn't matter that much because my baseline is met. The risk of losing this baseline becomes much more important to me than the prospects of marginally gaining more. This applies to trading because as developed as we think we are, we are still vertical monkeys. That's it. We are nothing more than that. What that means is if I start trading with a five hundred dollar account, because that's what I feel comfortable with. But let's say that I have a hundred thousand dollars. What ends up happening is I need to then get myself comfortable moving from, let's just say that you're sizing stuff at one percent just to pick a number.

Then the prospects of moving up to the next rung is difficult because then you have to get comfortable with seeing new numbers. Now this is a balance because I would never say for a brand new trader to start trading with all your money. That's crazy. But that is why I like paper trading so much because if you paper trade with an account that's relative to whatever your real money is, you get used to seeing these numbers and they become more and more relative to you, you're comfortable with them. You're like, oh, I just lost a thousand dollar on this trade. Your typical brain would say like, oh, fuck, that's a thousand dollars.

When you do those kinds of things, you make this journey harder, longer term. And this does not apply to everybody. This applies to people like me that grew up without much and scarcity, big scarcity mindset. Whereas people that typically grow up with a little bit more or other people that grow up without much but are just more risk open, that's a little tricky because this applies more so to scarcity. Whereas people that are risk open, this process is not that difficult. So I'm just giving that caveat. Okay. So let me see. There was a couple others in here that I wanted to let me see.

Actually, I think using a platform is suboptimal, literally suboptimal. I think putting it in Excel, Google Sheets, something like that is always the right choice. Always the right choice. The reason is because it allows you to analyze stuff. You cannot analyze stuff when it's in a platform interface. You can just see it there. Whereas if I put it in Excel or Google Sheets, I can track the trades that I made at different points. I can track my thought process at that point in time, not knowing what the future looks like. I can track the adjustments that I made and what impact that had on the profitability. I can test different kinds of signals that",

You could do data analysis in Excel, that kind of stuff.

And let's say that I need to build trade log. I'm trading a, what kind of strategy you guys want to trade? Pick a random strategy. I don't mean an option structure. I mean, a strategy. I need a profit mechanism for me to be able to do this with you. Otherwise, I have nothing for you. So what kind of profit mechanism? What kind of strategy do we want to trade? Positive drift. Beautiful. So we're going to trade positive drift. And we're going to call this longer term. So we're going to define that by at least six months. Okay, great. What kind of signals are relevant to this? Maybe stuff like prior, one year, six month, three month, one month, return, percent return. Maybe I think another thing that matters is percent off 52 week high. Maybe I think something else that's relative is spot price relative to moving averages and so on and so forth. So what I'm doing here is I'm before I even worry about what the fuck I'm going to put into Excel Google sheet. None of it matters yet.

You have to be thoughtful as you're building the trade log so that you're building something that you can conduct good data analysis on. If you conduct data, you can't conduct data analysis on like a note section where it's like I felt sad because I'm a sad boy. I can't do shit with this other than the fact that make fun of somebody for being this. I can't do anything with it. It's literally useless. Now, if you are doing something where you think your input is a big enough variable to disturb the outcome, you can track it. And then you can still look at it, but you'll have to conduct a qualitative data analysis or you just have to be smart with the kinds of things that you put into your notes. So you can do stuff like rate on a scale of one to 10, whatever it is that you're trying to qualify and quantify.

Because yeah, like when you're trading with a full account, you have to show up. And until you have a good proven track record with yourself that you can develop that trust, I think that kind of approach makes a ton of sense. I like that. Nascar says, trade logs make me think of that Mark Twain quote. History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Yeah, I think that that's, I think that that's very fair. And I think by having a good log, it gives you so much usable information that funny enough, it answers most of the questions that traders have. Seriously, if you think about traders when they ask stuff like what DTE is best, what Delta is best, all of that is solved.

But if I'm trading positive drift over the long run, expecting at least the six month holding period, this stuff is relevant to that. So then that's where it's strategy specific. So I would split it up into those two buckets personally. I think that's a good way to go about it. All right. Let's let's talk about these. Because this really isn't gonna take that long. And then this will prime us to be able to look at the next topic next week. This we've talked about actually a million times. There's a super simple way to explain this. So when we talk about the return expectations for a small account, for the dollar expectations, I should say. And this is always worth talking about. This is on the website.

And let's say that you get a crazy return of 30. In 20 years, what do you have? Nothing. You have nothing of interest after 20 fucking years. Now, if you notice, if you literally saved 100 a month, you would have 851,000 compared to this 10 times the amount. So the point that I'm making here is that for a really small account, the percent return has to be the focus, not the dollar return. And here's why. If we have that 500 account, and let's say that we have a 500,000 account. And let's just do like a quick year breakout. And let's use, I have something on my screen. I don't like it. Let's use a couple different return profiles, but we'll start with a basic one. Let's just say 10.

We need good penetration. Same return, 10 return. This 500 account becomes 550. You literally make 50. Couldn't possibly care less. 550,000 is a 50k return. That's something. That's not a ton, but it's something. So then if we chart this out over time, take a look at the difference between these accounts. Now it's like, yeah, no shit. If you have more money, you make more money. Here's the problem. The people with small accounts, they're so disenfranchised by this 50 year, by this 55 year, by this 60 year, that they're not paying attention to what the impact can be as their account grows. And they're completely inherently devaluing how important saving is. Saving is so unbelievably important in this conversation. Because let's say in year one, you are able to save 100. Completely detached from the return. I'm not going to bother adding it to the return and stuff. I don't care that much. But what I want to show you is what this is relative to your total return. 18.

So even though you return 10 on the year, by saving 100 over the course that entire year, that equates an 18.2 return, essentially doubling what you're able to produce. Now this differs. As your account grows, this number doesn't matter. Your savings rate represents 0.02 of your account. So in the beginning, savings is literally your superpower. And it only applies to when you have a small account. Savings becomes way more boring when you have a bigger account and you realize that you're not really doing a whole lot. But with this small account, even all the way out here, when you have this 12, 1300 account, saving 100 bucks, that gives you 7.7. That's a 7.7 return. But just saving 100. So what ends up happening is small accounts are so disenfranchised with this return that they don't pay attention enough to their savings rate. And in the pursuit of trying to get a much bigger dollar return, they're pursuing a much bigger percent return and the risk of ruined skyrockets. And the probability of them blowing up goes parabolic. So then instead of this 10 return, they want this to look like a bigger number. So they're",

Then maybe they're happy. But the problem is the probability of hitting this 100 return is so low, especially early on. And then the probability of being able to hit 100 return multiple times is even lower still. And the probability of coming into a massive problem, meaning account drawdown or blowing up an account in pursuit of 100 return is astronomically high. So this is why for small accounts, their dollar return expectations are completely fucked. And they should be focused way more simply on percent returns. And understanding that those percent returns are not designed to grow your small account. What's going to grow your small account is saving. Those percent returns are designed for as your account starts to hit a higher value based on savings growing your income, the other wealth levers that we talk about. That changes everything. So for those that are unfamiliar, I refer to it as the three levers of wealth. I guess this is a triangle. Three levers. Maybe we'll do here's a wall. That's level one. That's level two.

This is the thing that you're working on in the background, not for the immediate impact it's going to have on your small account. But the synergistic effect it will have when these two tie together. That's the point. So most traders with the small account just have a completely broken, completely broken model. Now sizing trades relative to the portfolio is super easy. You size trades relative to the portfolio based on as if it was any other size portfolio. It has to make sense. So one of the things to keep in mind is a small account is very frequently going to be oversized even slightly. So an example is if let's just go back to this this little model that we built since it's here and it's fun. Let's say that we were going to risk one percent of the portfolio.

That's the reality for a really small account. You're not going to get that far with that amount of money. So with the small account, you are literally forced to take more risk relative to the portfolio. But that does not mean that you get to take a bunch of risk. It still has to be logical. So and this answer is actually a couple of the other things in here. What we're about to talk to. This one, it's going to answer this one. It's going to answer this one. This one. This one. This one. It's going to answer all those. What we need to do with the smaller account is accept the reality of what this is. So you can't risk five, five bucks. You literally can't put anything on in that case. A great starting point is to figure out what's in the realm of possibility. So if we go to Tesla, Tesla's fine. And let's take a look at the option chain. And let's say that we want to, that's a lie, Tesla's not finding. It doesn't have dollar increments. Maybe it does here. It doesn't. Maybe here.

Let's do Ford because I know Ford is like the quintessential broke boy stock. And let's say that you want to sell puts. Okay. So if we sell a vertical, we can assess what the sizing might look like. So you can get 17 bucks and you're risking 83. So now if we go back, this is using a dollar wide spread. So then just, this is just to get context. So now we're saying for this account, I'm just going to move this down here. And let's say that you find a trade where your risk is 83 dollars or not 83 that would be crazy. 83 dollars is what we want. So what's that risk represent of the portfolio? So 16 it's a big risk. It's a big risk, no matter what, in a 500 account, it's a huge risk. You're putting nearly 20 of your account in a dollar wide vertical. So what does this tell us? In my opinion, this",

Now I'm not just basing this on this vertical spread because somebody could say, well, what if you buy an option? Well, if you buy an option and you have a stop in place, you are completely destroying your ability to make money in that thing unless your timing is perfect, absolutely perfect. So even if you sell this put and you say, well, I wouldn't let it be the full 83 loss, I would use a stop. Okay, fine. Let's just let's explore this scenario together. So in this case, we're looking to make 17. We're risking 83. Okay. So first, what's the probability of these different scenarios? Let's analyze. The first question is, what's the probability of forward being above, let's just call it our short strike, of 10 for Max Profit? What's the probability of this being above 10 at expiration? Well, we can use the options to tell this. The probability of this option being in the money at expiration, 30. So it gives us the inverse. So this is probability of loss. This is good old PP probability profit. This",

This is probability max profit. So this is 72. Okay. And we can figure out now what the expected return is for this by itself. We have 72 chance of making our 17. And then we have a 38 chance of losing 83. So we can figure out this by itself by itself. Out of the jump, this doesn't look great. Reese says wasn't at 62, 62 for what? The dollar wide spread? If it's, oh, is it the, did I fuck up the probability? No, the probabilities are good. No. Wait, what do we talk about? So anyways, yes, this is the expected return. So this means as a raw position with just the probabilities, the volatility, everything that price does is this is if you were to continue doing this long term, that's what you would be expected to make. Not great. So then you might find though, maybe you're good at timing the market. So then maybe the, the neutral probabilities don't represent your actual realize probabilities because you're good at determining direction.

Now you make money, right? So if you're able to be more directionally correct based on some sort of timing component, then this can make sense. But the broader point is now let's take a look and you say, well, I'm not going to let it get to 83 dollars. I would exit as soon as this hits 50 bucks. That still doesn't fix it actually. So let's do 40 bucks. That still doesn't fix it. It's 30 bucks. That fixes it. Make a buck. However, our probabilities just changed because if we take a look at when we would lose 30 bucks, that puts us here at 9.40. So now we just need to figure out what's the probability of touch at 940 in the duration of our trade, which is 18 July here. What's the probability of touching 940? 43.7. So you now have a 43.7 chance of getting stopped out. What just happened? We just fucking flip negative again. So this goes back to why sizing stuff relative and making sure",

So this goes back to why sizing stuff relative and making sure that when we're talking about things like risk reward ratios, placing stops where the stops go, we have to pay attention to the impact of the stop on the probability of the trade because it's profound. So this absolutely would require a trader to be quite adept at their broader trading skill set. So this is one of the biggest trade-offs with trading a small account is that you have to do this analysis and you are naturally going to be oversized no matter what. So let's say rather than a 500 account, we have 5,000 account. So now if we put on this one point wide spread, you're still risking 1.6. That's large relative to what this is, but that's tolerable. So one of the things is you have to start moderating and changing what you're doing to fit what makes sense. Now for me, if I was trading a 5,000 account, this is not what I would do. I would not sit here and try to trade vertical spreads because I would have absolutely no plan of trading vertical spreads longer term in this kind of capacity. And I would be putting that money into either stock replacements",

This isn't going to do shit because the other thing is we haven't even we haven't even entered friction. There's still costs to trade options. And as soon as you start adding those other components on top of this, it starts to become a pretty ugly picture pretty fast. So one of the big things here is understanding again, the biggest trade-off with a small account like this is that you're going to be out just oversized and off-sides way too fast. So you have to trade it with a completely different mentality, which is not trying to trade the small account to turn it into a ton of money. But trading the small account in the effort to refine your approach and build the skills so that as you continue to aggressively save and build your portfolio, that you're ready to deploy that larger portfolio in a way that's positively expected and would make money.

PDT restrictions on strategy change your strategy. That's literally it. You don't need to trade you don't have to trade that frequently. You don't need that many cycles. It's actually bad for you for a small account with friction because if we go back to just what's your guys' standard commission for, let's just say a single option. I don't know what it is for people. What would you say it is? 60 cents got it. Okay. So at 60 cents relative to your profit first, you're given up three and a half percent relative to your loss in the case of an adjusted loss. You're adding two percent to your loss relative to the account relative to the entire account. You're at 0.12 percent cost. This is expensive. This is very expensive.

I think that's you're not going to see the upfront cost, but you'll see it in terms of what you're quoted and what you can get a fill at. It's just the cost will be hidden for you. It will be on the back end. The point that I'm making here is that for a small account that's trying to scalp, the other thing is a small account trying to scalp isn't looking to make 17 bucks. If it's a 500 account, they're looking to make five 10 bucks. The friction that you're paying in order to pursue that is astronomically high. So this is easy. Small account. Just don't trade that fucking much. You're not doing yourself any favors. Just do other things. Simple. Let's see if there's any other stuff. EHUD says trading before understanding options buying, slash selling stocks before options. I don't think that's, I don't think you have to do that at all. I think it's completely fine to start with options right out of the gate. I think the main thing is taking the time to understand how options, how options behave. That's super important.

But yeah, the impact of trading options versus trading equities first, I would call it trivial. I think that there's absolutely nothing wrong with starting with options. I think it's completely fine. Another one, we just talked about this, right? So the way that you have to find good candidates is even if you're going to trade the smallest thing that you can find, a dollar wide vertical, you still need to be able to size it so that the risk makes sense. So that's, you have to restrict your sphere to stuff that makes sense relative to the size of your portfolio as you're trading the smallest thing that you could possibly trade. Again, like a dollar wide vertical and something. Mag seven via options for a super small account like that 500 account is not happening. Unless you just buy a share outright, what you could do. The other thing is adding wings is probably the only choice. Now again, relative to a 5,000 account, you're going to be oversized. Even on a 2.5 wide spread, that still is going to put you a little bit big, but it makes it accessible by adding the wing. Other than that, you get to",

That's because when I had a small account, it's one of the most common things I traded. And it's because it's one of the only things I could fucking afford. This we already talked about. This will never go away. This is your fate forever as a trader. So enjoy it. This one. I think the important thing I want to talk about actually for both of these is that stop losses are terrible with options in general, especially if you rest a stop loss. The overwhelming probabilities, you're going to get a terrible fill. And you're going to be hit too fast. So most of the time, what I do is use mental stops via alerts. I said an alert. And then if I hear the alert go off, I'll go in and manually enter. The other thing is if I have to place a stop and it's going to be a resting stop, it has to be a stop market.

So this one will be our win rate. This one will be our loss rate. So we have a 65 chance of losing. But if we hit, let's say we make 1,000, and if we lose, let's say we lose 200 bucks. And we run our standard expected return calculations on these. You'll notice that this is profitable. Even though this has a low hit rate, it doesn't matter. Because when it hits, it hits big enough that it overwhelms the higher frequency of these smaller losers. You make money. You make good money. This is another massive problem for small accounts, thinking like high win rates is the is the way. And it's absolutely not. It's whatever works. Now, let's say though that you say, no, I need to get stopped out at 5 max loss all the time. Well, what ends up",

Now, let's say though that you say, no, I need to get stopped out at 5 max loss all the time. Well, what ends up happening with something like that, then is your loss rate will go up. Your max loss would go down to whatever. But then that means that your hit rate absolutely has to contract pretty meaningfully. And you'll notice that that just made you 100 less good. And there's a chance that it literally could put you again in the scenario of what we're talking about, having, having your loss. It wouldn't just move you 15 points. You don't just move from 65 to 80 if you cut your loss in half. This would actually be closer to like 90. So then you can start moving yourself to a point where by applying that management, you literally lose money. So the point I'm making here is that your exit, it has to be made relevant to the strategy. It can't just be always do blank. It's not going to work. Ricky says, why not stop limit again? I find it hard to believe you wouldn't get filled if it's liquid within the bid ask, even if it's towards the more unfavorable side. You can find it as hard to believe as you want.

And that you already said, I need to get out at x points that you were now far beyond because you were being cheap on the exit. That's the nature with stops. If we're saying I have to get out at this point for my strategy to make sense for this to make whatever it is, then you have to get out. So trying to be cheap on an exit like that is typically not going to work super low. So the main thing is with a stop limit. There's not and it's not an insignificant chance. It's not a huge chance.

So it tells me like I have to get out. So if I know I have to get out, then how to get out? It is what it is. That's the that's the primary reason why. This one. This one's super important. So a lot of small accounts will say like, oh, is this worth my while? And it can be worth your while. But the point is if you start the process of trading from the perspective of is this worth my time? It's like, bitch, you don't even know what your time is worth. You might be awful at trading and your time in trading might not be worth anything. It might lose you money. The main thing here is that you have to think of the deeper game.

It's not going to be worth your while at all relevant to the time you put in and the dollars you make. That's just the reality of it. So you have to just completely change completely change your perspective here. Now, for profit taking, that's also super simple because that's going to be relative to the strategy. Whatever the strategy is that you built, the one thing I can generally say, the less you have to do something as an obstetricator, the better. So what that means is if you're profit taking wraps around like a ton of market interactions, you're probably doing a little too much. And you probably need to chill out because again, of the cost associated with it, which is not insignificant. Portfolio correlation is actually a really fun one.

I want to talk to you about portfolio correlation for small accounts because it's very, very challenging. Super challenging. So when you're trading a small account, you already have a very limited pool of stuff you have access to like really, really difficult. Jared says drink in the same you really cheers. Cheers to you, Jared. Good choice. The pineapple is the way, man. You're already trading a very limited set of things right from the jump. So then on top of trading a very limited set of things, you can't put on that many things because then you end up having too much risk on too fast. So let's just look at a general scoping scenario on how to manage this. And it's not that difficult. It just takes a little bit of thought. So let's say we do have this 5,000 account. And let's take a quick look at what a perspective portfolio could look like for it. And let's just eyeball it quickly. I don't want to spend too much time trying to pick stuff that I actually like.

So we're not going to make any money doing it. Great. Love that for us. So trade one. We're looking to make 15. And we're risking 85. Doll hairs. This is bold. They are bold. That's trade one. So then we can track what our total profit potential is. Then we can track what our loss is. And then again, we can go through the effort, which I typically would do of including the expected return, right? So inputting the probabilities for these and that stuff. I just don't want to waste the time doing it right now. And I just want to talk to you about trying to find different stuff. So then if we think about this trade, we can speculate and we can calculate what the beta-weighted delta's are. So let's say that this gives us minus one beta-weighted delta. This is good.

So then as we look at other trades to put on in conjunction with this. So we look at trade two. And let's see if we can find something that would generally fit appropriately. One of the things that I would do for this kind of thing is maybe we literally go super, super rudimentary. And we just do something like this, a vol based scan. And what I would do here is I would get rid of the weeklies because that's going to naturally limit you to two few things. Right? If you look at all optionable names, it's 52.77. If you limit it to weekly, it's like less than 1,000. Now the other thing is of this 52.77, we know we can't afford a whole lot. So we can only get the stuff that's a dollar wide.

Okay, so this is looking for stuff with that's at least in the 50 IV percentile range. And we have a handful of names. N-L-Y. What's this N-L-Y? Kind of range bound so we can see maybe what a short put spread might look like. 33 Delta's. Yeah, that's fine. So this now gives us, let's just call it maybe 22 bucks on your fill. Like if you actually get your 22 bucks, which you know would be a little bit sus 78 here. And let's say this gives you plus 1.2 beta weighted Delta's to spy. This is kind of the, this is the game that you have to play.

So this is why the probabilities of this stuff is really important to help contextualize what this risk is. And then you can literally do the expected value for the entire portfolio and figure out if it makes sense to risk 11.5 of your portfolio to make 126. Because if we take a look at this on a comparative basis, you're trying to make 2.5 of your portfolio, but your risk in 12. Effectively.

I'm not going to base the risk based on this. I'm going to base the risk based on where I would get out based on my strategy. So maybe I would get out if it breaks below this perceived support line here. So 540. What would my loss be at 540? 50? 51? Right on target. Pretty damn close. So this is more so what I would be doing for kind of more speculative style plays. And I would still seek to build a core allocation for sure. And that would be to trade coverage strangles in different kinds of ETFs. You can start with leverage ETFs. I absolutely tinkered in and out of them. A bunch of them were in around when I first started trading. But there's stuff that I absolutely would have used. And to trade something like ratio called diagonal in a leverity ETF is not that difficult, but it's super risky. And that's you have to figure out what looks right for you. The point there though is you have to be thoughtful about how you build this portfolio in how it all coalesces together into something that represents risk you're comfortable with.

It's really good thoughts from him on it. So hopefully I can expand on it slightly in a way that does service to his broader, his, the broader pointy's making. Well, you know, time will tell. But here's, here's what we have to pay attention to. If I'm trading a strategy, and let's say the strategy calls for me to risk 5 of the portfolio on each trade. So again, we go back 5,000 account. I thought it might understand what I meant. It looks like, wait, what the fuck? There you go. And I'm going to risk 5 of the account. We can get a sense of how many trades I would need to have on. Or how many times I can withstand a trade going against me subsequently. So I can have an idea of what the total allowable path would be. So let's just build a version of this together. So if on trade one, this doesn't mean trades trade one, two, three, and a portfolio. This just means a sequence of trades. It could be things that are on at the same time or things that are",

So this is our starting point. I'll just drag this down one more so we can get to 25 just because. So now what we do is just continue this math. So we now have a 4750 portfolio. Our portfolio went down. So we can figure out what risk we have. I'm going to lock this one. And now we're down to 4512. So what I'm showing you is that if we apply some sort of fixed sizing, we can figure out how many trades we have to run before we have a problem. So in an example like this, if you're risking 5 of your portfolio, you draw down half the account if you have 13 losing trades. Does your strategy have a decent probability of losing 13 trades based on the frequency that you run it? So the reason why path is so important is because in order to reap the benefits of a good strategy, you have to be able to endure the bad periods, which can be very difficult to",

So the reason why path is so important is because in order to reap the benefits of a good strategy, you have to be able to endure the bad periods, which can be very difficult to do. And the only way to do that successfully is to build something robust enough that you're like, okay, I'm risking not 5 of the portfolio based on this strategy because there is a decent loss chance and the potential for a loss streak is not insignificant. Scalping is bad. We already talked about that. Trade adjustments. The main thing with this is based on the strategy because like, say for example, you're trading a ratio called diagonal, there's a bunch you could do with respect to trade adjustments. But the main thing to pay attention to is the idea of like rolling options and stuff like that because the effects that I talk about of rolling options in a small account become way more pronounced in terms of literally running out of cash. You can run to a point where you might have the net link in the portfolio, but you literally can run out of the money. You can run out of cash. That can be a problem.

Now you can circumnavigate that in a couple different ways if you use an actual rolling order that's executed simultaneously and stuff like that. But you can put yourself in a bit of a dangerous spot. And these last ones are actually really simple because when small accounts go through these emotional cycles, it's literally just because they're not focused on the right stuff. That's it. They're too focused on the dollar amounts and they're not focusing enough on the development of a strategy and thinking of it purely from the lens of getting data points to build out their strategy. If you can do that, you're going to be in a way better spot. The last thing, this is something all of us have done without a doubt. And this is when we start trading options before we actually understand how they behave. The reason why that's so important is because by understanding how they behave, it gives you an insane amount of information regarding how you might choose to set up your idea. So for example, if we're looking at this same long option thing, and let's say that I was trading something a little bit more like a breakout style. Let's say that I had caught it on this day here, for example. Well, if I had caught it on this breakout day here, then there's an",

Because if it's a breakout, I'm probably not going to go out necessarily this far in a super small account. If it's a breakout that I'm expecting to hold maybe for a week, maybe two weeks, I might come in because take a look at the difference in price for these, about half the price. You become very price sensitive with a small account. And if you don't understand options, you might instead say, oh, well, I'll come in here to the 21 days, they're even cheaper. But then if we take a look at faded a K for these options, they're in the third decimal, that's why it shows the same. But if we take a look at faded a K in these options relative to one another and also even take a look at the delta relative to one another. If I get a 1 move, I'm only getting 27 cents on this side.

But my broader point is all of that comes from a better understanding of options themselves so that you can make informed decisions on how you might choose to structure them. So taking the time to learn how options actually behave is always worth your while. It's actually something that I'm trying to work on right now. I'm trying to work on, there's a ton of free courses and stuff. I don't want to do a course. But what I'm interested in doing is trying to come up with an exercise packet so that you can test yourself and actually do something to explore your understanding of options in a bunch of different ways, hopefully to make you feel more confident if you're able to answer things successfully or to identify gaps in what you're doing and maybe not answering things as successfully as you might.

Well, I guess it depends on like what kind of questions you're trying to solve with black sholes. Black sholes really is really is nothing that crazy. Black sholes simply gives us a way to deconstruct option prices. That's pretty much it anymore because when we look at black sholes in a broader context, it doesn't represent actual option pricing models anymore. Like it really doesn't. So because of that, I don't really think that it's worth a ton of like trying to deconstruct it to be able to run the differential equation yourself. For example, as long as you understand that it is a differential equation, there's important inputs to it that help you understand the option markets around and stuff like that. I realistically think that's plenty good. And then you can tinker with maybe finding ways to optimize it a little bit or maybe coming up with your own pricing models.

Okay dynamic sizing is there is whoops is there a specific strategy that you're interested in dynamic sizing relative to because that would differ a lot based on strategy for me. Actually pretty massively. And then if not that's cool we can we can discuss it. In the money versus out of money that's not really relative to this is actually really useful. This is really useful because I'm realizing that it seems like for some of the group that might be interested in strategies like I actually think the way that I would talk about the strategies might be a little heavy for like the beginner for the beginner format. I have to think on this a little bit more. Green star this is just a note for me. Green storm out to level this because as I'm thinking about like the stuff that comes to my mind to talk about I think it will be based on what I'm seeing in the chat it probably will be a little bit heavy which is okay I want to make sure that it's I want to make sure that it's made relevant to the to the theme of the of the live stream for the Fridays. That's useful. In the money versus out of money we can take a note on that in the money versus out of the money use of option. Yeah. Ricky says how do I",

In the money versus out of money we can take a note on that in the money versus out of the money use of option. Yeah. Ricky says how do I dumb this down to the hips in the chat? Yeah I mean it is absolutely about leveling it appropriately because a lot of this stuff can be challenging. A lot of this stuff can be like really challenging in the beginning to learn but then as you learn it's really not it's not in crazy but it takes a little time to get there. So yeah this is useful it gives me a lot of ideas and actually the most important thing that this gives me completely completely straight up is the way that I naturally think about talking about this wouldn't work well and I need to think about that actually quite a bit differently which is good like that's actually really really good for me to know so that I can make this actually useful to you guys.
