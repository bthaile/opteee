I couldn't get too close to it because of how windy it was. But it has like this nuts waterfall that just right runs right down the center like that's not manmade is just like that, which I thought it was pretty sick this funny enough it's coming up to the point where I almost crash crash the drone. We'll save that for next time, but that did happen. And when I pretty much, let me see if this changes the thing automatically really quick as I'm talking. Oh, it didn't. Okay, cool. So I made sure to click back into OBS. But yeah, when I was flying right around there, the wind was absolutely insane. And it made it very difficult. You'll see in the next time that we do a live stream on Monday, when I do like the Iceland video, I have a bunch of drone footage. So we're still working through the Iceland one. What's up, everybody? It's great to see you all. We actually had two live streams today. I just finished one like 45 minutes ago where I was kind of just talking about a strategy thing that I think will be kind of fun to do together. But this video is entirely different. This video is about the crowd",

I just finished one like 45 minutes ago where I was kind of just talking about a strategy thing that I think will be kind of fun to do together. But this video is entirely different. This video is about the crowd favorite, the fabled GameStop. So let me get my study materials. And we have a couple ways we can start the video. We can either do like a quick recap of GameStop. I was actually planning on doing a little bit more of like a current state GameStop analysis tomorrow for tomorrow's market prep video because I haven't done one in a while. And so today we can dig straight in to take a look at the cats old stuff and see what we can dig up and learn. We still have a long ways to go with respect to analyzing his trades and making sure that like I'm actually building the trades as I want. So we can dive right into that if we want. I'm going to grab his YouTube channel as well because I want to take a look at some of the stuff we were picking up on last time. So we have a lot to get into. Now as for always before we get too far started, let me grab the chat. And I would love to do two things first. Say hello to everybody second. I want to take a look at our map.",

What I can tell you though, genuinely is the skier that they eat is talking fantastic. So big, big, big, big, big fan of the skier that they have. That's actually what we get now back in the States because I don't know, I just really like that. Greek yogurt is good. I think skiers light yours better. So that part highly remarkable. Just about that part, I don't really, yeah, there was nothing really too remarkable. The other thing that I thought actually, it's funny because you mentioned an Icelandic restaurant even in New York City is because one of the things that comes across in Iceland that's very similar to New York City is they really like hot dogs. They really, really like hot dogs. So if you go into a gas station, they all have this little griddle and it's like super normal to get hot dogs. I got a bunch of hot dogs while I was there.

I'm almost positive we have. Okay, then maybe I look like I was wrong. We didn't have Detroit. Now we got that. James says San Diego, which we already have San Diego for sure because that's where your boy is. I am a rep in us in San Diego, but I'll add San Diego proper if that's you're down that way. Do we have that? Off-Punsa's Vienna is in Slavic. I didn't say Vienna was Slavic. I said it's in a Slavic region. Everything around Vienna is very Slavic like Slovakia, like Hungary, like Austria, like pretty much all of these. Beverly Hills, we don't have that one yet. Beverly Hills, that James is from Coronado, okay. Nope, that's Corona. I'm an idiot for a Nado. Perfect. Very good. Akron. Akron, I feel like I've heard before, but we'll add that. Perfect. All right. So we still have homework because we still need to find representation either from Iceland or from Greenland and then Madagascar or what was Tasmania? Those were the choices.

And if you think about it, he's not made to care. There's nothing about a million dollar fine for Citadel, which did 2.9 billion in trading revenue last quarter alone. Like that's super frustrating. Like that, I really don't like that. Long Swayze says, do they have to correct the reports? I don't know. I assume that they would have to amend them because I think that in the article I read, they had already amended some of them, but they needed to go through and amend more of them. So because they had found another error going back. So I do think that they'll probably have to go through and fix them. The problem is, and I think a lot of people might be thinking that there's some sort of like really nefarious activity going on underneath the surface and there could be, but I just really doubt it. The reason why I really doubt it with respect to this specific thing to be clear, not with respect to Citadel, but with respect to the reporting is because with like even if",

And there was during that one debate where Hillary says, oh, well, you know, Trump doesn't pay taxes. And Trump says, no, like I do pay my taxes, but I use these write-offs so that I can decrease how much I have to pay. And I think the question that the moderator asks is like, do you use like these tactics or whatever to, you know, decrease how much you have to pay. And Trump says, of course, I do because, you know, it's the same reason why I do it in like her donors use it.

And it's not even a loophole. Like we call it loophole, but it's, it's just literally following the laws. It's written. So if I actually don't really know what loophole means, maybe it is a loophole. Let me look at one second. I'm going to look at the definition. No, no, this one. I'm grabbing warm and chat GPTX. We're going to need it to find loophole. Let's see.

Yeah, then I don't think that's a, I don't think he's using loopholes like he's literally following it as it's written. Like for example, there's a really important, I try to talk to, to traders about a holistic approach to wealth. And then we'll get to games that by promise. But I hope this point is well received slash useful for some of you. So one of the things about being really smart about being a trader is developing a holistic approach to wealth. How can you do that? By having different asset classes, there are different asset classes that behave differently, that provide different benefits. So for example, I think it's exceedingly smart for most people to get some sort of exposure to real estate. And the reason why I think it's super important to get exposure to real estate is because there is insanely better tax treatment there than other places. As a trader, you are destroyed on taxes. In real estate, you are not. It's very, very tax incentivized. So having a broader approach to wealth typically leads to better outcomes. But that's my two cents. Okay. So let us get into GameStop.

I think it was somewhere in like the 22nd is where the additional 20 000 would have been put on at some other strikes. Or no, I'm sorry, not some other strikes, just at different points during the day. So what I'm highlighting here is I think we have a pretty good idea of the position that he built out, when he built it out and how he built it out. And when I looked at the way that he moved into this position, I did find it really interesting. Because if we kind of color code this a little bit, we'll run that orange for the 20th. Then we'll go that for the 21st. 22nd, which again, if I'm not mistaken, I think off-pooden said that there's two more here.

And put in just for my context, was that on the 22nd, am I remembering that correctly? Or did you find, was it another day? I just wanted like add a mental note so at least I can track it. So there's, oops. So here's the 24th, the 28th, and then the 30th. Putin says the 20th to the 29th, oh, that's super not helpful. You're saying that the additional 20,000 up here from his position, you're saying that the additional 20,000 occurred over all of these days, not on a single one of the days. Is that correct? I just want to make sure I'm following. 22nd was the big day at 70K. Okay, so 22nd here, let's track. Yeah, okay, so I have it right. So because I'm tracking 50 that came through in these blocks. So you're tracking 70, which would mean that there, that's, this is exactly what it would have been. Okay, I didn't think that I was missing that. I'm going to add additional, but it wasn't in 5K blocks though, correct? Additional 20K, 20 calls. Putin, can you let me know if you saw it in small, this was 5K. Well, I tracked all of the 5K. All right, let's do this together really quick. Oops, well, while I'm",

Then we have 3,1, 25, where's this 2,5? 0918. That's not here. Oh, there it is. Oh, it came in at the mid. Do I have 25 twice? 0852, 25. No, that's okay.

And I have no idea where they are. Let's look at maybe 500. And it still doesn't let me pick the fucking expiration cycle. That's so frustrating. This would be so much cleaner if I could just pick the correct expiration cycle. Brain Titty says he could have had them before. Yeah, we'll probably have to go back, yeah, months before. Maybe it absolutely could be the case. I just want to verify that I'm not missing anything short term here. But I'm generally agreeing with you the wrong. All right. So now let's go back. I mean, let's start from fucking 24. Let's see. That's not it. That's not it. That's not it. Those are me. My head isn't a fucking blender right now. Ah, ah. Ah, I have another idea. I have another idea. Here or not, I have one more idea. Let's try this. Let's go to when did he post his update to June? Is that correct? Doctors says you're missing 5K and 529. Oh, perfect. Maybe this is easier than you say I'm missing 5K on 529. So that would go in here. Let's check. That would be a fucking hope that's true. 529. Market open, market close. I don't think I am.

This specific option. All Putin says volume was 8460 on the 29th. Yeah, the volume could be 8460. Yeah, exactly. The volume's 8460, but that doesn't mean that he traded it. Because if I look if I'm limiting it by 500. Yeah, it's that's not him. Because this is going to look at any of the larger trades that happen.

So his pure his pure cost here 565 and then his basis is 567 54 equals no let's do. How do I want to do this? I'm going to add a row here. Get rid of this. This would be a little size to premium move those here. This will be a long option basis. And then his long option reported basis is 5.6754. And equals. Uh. Those 100 times this. Times this. So his total premium comes to 68104800. And then the variance between these this minus. This times this times 100. 314,000. So then this divided by this. You 62. It seems. It seems steep.

Because my long option basis is 565. His is 56575. So I think this is fine because this is using just the premiums. This isn't including anything. So then we can see what is overall fees were, which is about 314,000. But that seems too much. Because you guys are saying each rate is like 50 cents a contract. Hmm. Let's see. What is this times 0.5? That's only 60. Yeah, interesting. So the variance is a little bit higher. I don't. Don't totally have an answer to it right now, but I don't actually think it matters that much to be honest. I'm not ultra concerned about it. So. So.

And he had. The last we saw. Was 200,000. And he had at 200,000. 55.1774. And. Now when he comes back the basis. 21274. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. So. From the eight. So. From the eight community. What's the current. What's the current best guess. On the the variance. And when he when he bought this stuff. I don't know what the like the larger theory is. So this was on. 21 July. Is that right. And then two June. Two June 24. And then this was like 21 July. I think 21 or April. I'm sorry. 21 April. 21. Something like that. Okay. So does the. Do",

One, two, wait, what is this? One, two, seven, four, yeah. So then his cost basis here is what, 22, four, seven, oh, eight, which this equals. 22, four, seven, oh, eight, that's on the delta shares. Oh, man, this is tricky. 24 mil. Robo says. Newton's video touched on an RK exercise into force naked shorts to buy. When do we think he exercised from that video, Robo? We can take a look at that. So you mean on this most recent one or when in May, when in May, when in May, when in May, buy in May, go away, sell in May, go away, there's also a saying that goes along with may of some shit, some about may. Yeah, if you guys let me know, well, Robo, if you can take a look at the video at some point, let me know and we can take a look. The reason why I think this happened here is because everything was caught completely off sides. That's what I think because we started seeing volume ramping in the stock. And let's take a look at the options markets from one to 10 May, one to 10 May. And let's get rid of, we'll keep the bids for now. It doesn't really matter. May 10",

You know who that looks like. The thing that I don't think aligns well is the duration because this is like 11 days. But let's take a look. We now have references. Let's take a look at some of his old work and see if he bought like really short dated options like that. So this looks like all exits this we can get rid of. I'm going to add a column here. And then I also, I want to go back to the beginning because we started from like one step here. So let me, let me finish satiating this desire. What I want to do is I'm just going to add a column like when he bought options because Newton already has somewhere where stock was bought. I know that that was done. So I'm not going to replicate him adding stock plus we can also see when some of it changes. But I want to specifically look at the options because there's not a ton of times that he did it.

So this is Ricky says yay. Question mark. Yeah. So the reason why this is very exciting to see is because I can clearly identify this is the first time I've seen him buy really short dated options, which means it's much less of a departure for him to do this kind of thing as as compared to if he never did this sort of thing. So the fact that this is part of it actually is really really cool to me. So it is yay. It's actually a pretty big yay for me at least. This is 31 Jan 2020. So 31 Jan 2020. TG.

And then there's no transactions until 21 fed. So off Putin I don't think you're correct. Because there's no volume. It looks like they expired worthless to me. And my guess is he added money. Because the going rate for the contracts. There's no volume. So maybe we go later in the day. And since. Yeah, but Putin you're you're missing my point here. My point is there's no volume. Like there's no again. Following his fab update here. There's no volume. Is the so that that's what's confusing me here. I don't see how you're drawing that. I don't see how you're drawing that the eights came down. For 10 cents because I don't see any volume for those eights. So yeah. That would be helpful to understand. Because what I like from what I see now. From the last point he updated. There were essentially no changes. To the position. And then from what I can see here, there was no volume. And I don't see any volume for the last 10 cents. Hence, hence my supreme confusion here. Let's see what it looked like in this time period. We got to grab the crowd favorite Yahoo Finance.

Yeah, that argument wouldn't make any sense. I would love to hear Matt's argument or like what his position is. So I just don't understand it. Lance says could cause a lot of retail to FOMO in and lose tons and premiums for worthless contracts. Now that at least I could understand the incentive there. Again, I I think that it's a really, really silly theory to be completely honest. Just because even in that scenario, hedge funds can make or not even hedge funds, but market making firms hedge funds institutions can make so much more money than what they could conceivably pull from retail by, you know, playing little games like that.

Most of what I see so far is when he tweets now, which is important to know. I mean, let's take a look at it. I'm down for a fucking. It's a field trip. Let me finish. Deb. Any more do we have. April. Okay, perfect. Yeah, this is going to go fast. Let me finish this. And then let's do an analysis on when the cat tweets and what game stop price did.

GME can't be valued at something. It's not worth the market one. Allow it. Well, Matt, I agree to a to a degree specifically related to Moas, but I don't agree in terms of the market, not allowing it because not permitting valuation at something. It's not worth because that's actually not how markets work. It's our perfect valuation machines. They're supply and demand measurements. So, I don't agree with that. I do agree with the market won't allow it because the numbers that I've seen for Moas are literally insane. Because I mean, they turned off the buy button before. And that was to prevent like quite literally a systemic collapse. So, I completely agree with you. I mean, I think that they wouldn't allow GameStop to run into forever. Now, I also do think though that they could let GameStop run more and hurt the people that probably should be hurt, at least in my opinion. But yeah, I mean, they're not going to let GameStop just go into infinity. So, the people that are like really hoping for Moas and whatnot, I get it. I don't think it would happen. Okay, so this is 14 Jan. Which is row nine. Just make sure we're good. So, this worry bought those.",

But it's dozens and I think I think he's trading under the general premise of he thinks the stock is going to go up right? Obviously, but like that's the main thing to me. It looks like he's he's focusing on. So the really fascinating component to this is he's essentially trying to play these as a leveraged delta play because if you can get a few thousand of these for super, super cheap on something that you think is going to go up even though it's not building a massive gamma ramp necessarily because it's so far out in time. Like for example, if I go 49 DTEs and we look at some of the options that are still super far out of the money, like you'll notice that the gammas are much like massive comparatively, right? So if we look at a 10 delta here or even a 13 delta, the gamma on these 168s is eight, but up here they're 16 because options that are closer in time are going to have way, way, way more gamma. So it's not building a gamma ramp. It's way too far out in time for that. And this looks far more like trying to build leveraged directional exposure. The other thing that I cannot help but notice is that so far we've literally seen him do this once where",

The other thing that I cannot help but notice is that so far we've literally seen him do this once where he buys these much near term DTE options. He literally did it this once and then it doesn't look like he touched it again, which I can't help but find that interesting. The vast majority of his entries here, 495 DTE, he added more, which would still be a couple 100 DTE, 52 DTE, 107 DTE, 198 DTE, 458 DTE, 3 DTE. It's the only one that you see like that, which is 94 DTE for this one. Here it's 138, 229, 229, 168, 137. So if we were to plot those numbers, the overwhelming majority of them are greater than 100, and essentially all of them except for one are greater than 90. I think that's really important because this, I don't know what this was. I don't know if he thought, was there news on this day that you guys are aware of the 14th of Jan? Because that's also a weird day for the update. So what happened there? 14th Jan. Here you go, holiday sales readout. So that's my guess.

My guess that he thought something was going to happen around this. It looks like he was playing the event itself because there's really no other reason for the departure on that. And it ties well the fact that there was an event there. So that's what that looks like. Him trying to play that event with a little bit of money. So the overwhelming information that I have available now, based on all of these old trades analyzing literally all of these old trades, is that he has some very, very clear tendencies in terms of holding duration, delta selection, DTE selection. This clearly was a departure that was predicated on a specific event. So one of the artifacts we can take away from this is that if we see him play near dated options that probably in first he thinks an event is happening. Because otherwise all of these other options that I can see, they tell me that he looks at them as just longer term opportunities to trade something to the upside with leverage. Like that's that's very, very, very much what I can see here. And then he doesn't touch these again until 25 know it looks like. And it looks like he sold the 17s. So I mean, let's just break this down. So he sold the 15 Jan 21",

Yep. He thinks he never sells GME. He thinks he sells calls, which I don't agree with. If he sold calls and played cycles, yeah, so he just talks about the delta, I see.

So the 16 April 20s, he took 200 down here. So here it's minus 200. And then he's holding 800. So then the 15s, he sells 300. Holds 500. Shares. And then it looks like he exercised the 16 April.
