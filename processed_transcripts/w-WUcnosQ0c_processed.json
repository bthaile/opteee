    "text": "How I would start investing. No frills, no bullshit. This is a video precipitated by one of my friends that I went to Officer candidate school back in 2012 with. He reached out with this exact question and I want to make a supplementation video for him and for other people because I know others have this question. So let's get straight into this thing. Very first off we have what happened here. Well this is it and overall this is just my buddy reaching out saying, Hey, I'm curious at what to do with my money because he makes really great money now, which is awesome, but he acknowledges that his investment knowledge is not right and he's looking to get educated, which is awesome. It's exactly why I do this. So I referred him to this blog post right here and it is a big post that runs through literally if you know nothing, it teaches you why investing and a lot of supplementation on how to go from nothing to actually opening up a brokerage account and being able to put on a buy and hold position. But I wanted to color in some of the shaded areas for him and hence let's get straight to it. So the very first thing I would advise myself if I were to start investing is to start with goals. And I refer to this all the time it's from Stephen Covey's seven habits of highly successful people. And this",

And I refer to this all the time it's from Stephen Covey's seven habits of highly successful people. And this is begin with the end in mind. This is super important because depending on what your objectives are, you have to behave differently. So what I would do is outline a 20 year 10 year, five year one year goal that is specific, measurable, achievable in time bound. So the idea here is right out of the gate. We are outlining for ourselves what we want to accomplish. So in 20 years, I want to be fully retired in 10 years. I want to see clear progress that within the next 10 years, I will be at my benchmark. Over the next five years, I want to create the supplementation skill set income streams, those kinds of things. And then over the course of this year, I want to start investing. I'm going to save x number of dollars per month, that sort of thing. So once we have our goals outlined, we need to assess our savings and we need to save more aggressively than where you're at even right then.

And it's a guarantee because no matter what, the earlier you start saving and prioritizing that, the earlier you get to this fabled early retirement that you then don't have to worry about money ever again. And you can start buying things that you want without worrying about if it's on sale or using coupons. You get to stop worrying about money. The way you get there is by sacrificing near term outcomes. So yes, you might not be able to go to the club three nights a week and spend a thousand dollars a week trying to do that. But if you give that up up front and embrace delayed gratification, you can start achieving much more interesting outcomes. So for here, if you were just saving, let's say you had a hundred dollars a month for 30 years, that gives you 36,000 dollars. However, if you have that same hundred dollars, you're saving that hundred dollars per month. Over the course of 30 years, if it was invested is 200,000. This is exactly the point I'm trying to help express to people that saving is a giant amplifier for investing. So to recap these two outline what you want, start saving and get religious about it. It should be automatic every single month. The worst thing you could do is say, Oh, I only have 50.",

    "text": "investing, buying, holding investing is going to be a better route because you really get to capture most of the benefit, right? That 80 20 rule. You could put in a very little amount of effort and capture the majority of the benefits of investing in the stock market. You also get better tax treatment if you're holding products for longer than a year. The whole idea of actively trading is really for two or three purposes as far as I can see it. The first purpose is to outperform the stock market. And the reason why that matters is I will show you this right here. If we go to this compound interest calculator on my website, which is totally free, we can use the standard amounts here. And let's just say you're saving that extra 100 a month. Let's just put this out to 20 years. Okay. So now let's say that the stock market is somewhere between seven and 12. So we'll leave it at 10. This is your return. If let's just say you're buying holding at this rate with the savings. However, if you're able, let's say to add 5 on top of that, notice this kind of blue line with the triangles. All of a sudden, you would go from that 102 thousand dollars to 205,000. That's if you're able to return 15 versus 10.

So the whole idea here is if you are an active trader, the first goal is to outperform the market. The second goal could be for income. You can trade different styles to generate monthly, quarterly income or you can trade to reduce portfolio variance. But that's not really a great approach in my opinion. If you're going to trade, it should probably be at least if it were me for one of those two reasons that I mentioned in the beginning. So let's talk about the environment real quick. We already know why we're investing. We're going to take a risk for a return. When you put money in the stock market, you are committing capital, which is at risk. It can decline in value or even go to zero. But we're doing that for the sake of a return. So when we think about the stock market, if you are brand new, this is really all you need to know is that there are different securities that make up the stock market. These are just the products you can trade. And there are things called equities derivatives and debt. Debt is exactly what you're used to hearing. These are your bonds that you can access to derivatives or things like options and futures. I primarily trade options.",

It is what I happened to pick when I started trading back in 2007. And I like them. So I stay with them. But you can pick any of these major brokers. I would avoid places like Robin Hood. They're not really a great broker specifically for active traders, for passive traders. It doesn't really matter as much. Kind of pick whatever makes you happy. But the broker is what gives you access to the stock market so that you can then start taking a look at these different things. So now let's get into kind of the rest of this thing.

So if you take a look at this and we look at the NASDAQ 100, this is QQQ. So you're gaining exposure to all of these. And when I'm talking about IWM, this is 2000 small cap stocks.

    "text": "all of these. And when I'm talking about IWM, this is 2000 small cap stocks. You're gaining exposure to all of these. So that's one portfolio. Another idea here is 60 spy. Would you know what that is already? And 40 TLT, which is 20 year US government bonds. And you can take a look at what the final balance is between these, what the compound annual growth rate is. And if you notice, compared to the SP 500 by itself, if you do something as simple as IWM and QQQ, you outperform it. Honestly, now you can take a look at the worst year to see if you're comfortable with the drawdown that you might have. The max drawdown is the lowest it gets at a certain point in time. But the cool part about this kind of product is you can get an idea of how different things work. And if you are a buy and hold investor, again, if it were me, I would literally just pick spy. And every single month put more money into your brokerage account so that I could buy more shares of spy. And just do that into perpetuity. Because if you take a look at this for the period that we're looking at, which is 2010 all the way through current day 2023, if you have a 12.12 compound annual growth rate, well, let's come back to this. Let's say let's get rid of that. And let's instead look at if",

Let's say let's get rid of that. And let's instead look at if we have that 12 compound annual growth rate and what that can do for you. Specifically, if you get more serious about saving, which is that thing I kind of reminded you in the beginning. So instead of 100, let's say you could do 500 a month. Well, now in 20 years, you essentially have half a million dollars that's starting with just five grand. And let's say you get better at saving or let's say over the time span, your average monthly contributions grows because your income is growing. And let's say you could do a thousand dollars, not in the beginning, but over this 20 year period that becomes your average. Well, now you're a millionaire done and done starting with 5,000 at the average stock market return. That is the beauty of investing. So in this case, you can tinker with different things, find what you like, but this is just to give you some ideas and where you can start. Now for the people that are trading, it's a little bit different because investors from here, they just have to monitor, save, buy more on a regular cadence and rebalance if they want.

Now for the people that are trading, it's a little bit different because investors from here, they just have to monitor, save, buy more on a regular cadence and rebalance if they want. But again, if you're just using one ticker spy, then you're done. And you might get to a point where you say, I want to decrease a little bit of risk. I'm getting closer to retirement. Well, that's pretty simple. All you do is modulate how much you're putting in bonds. So let's say you're getting close to retirement, you're not looking to grow your money anymore. You just kind of want some income and to protect your capital. Well, maybe this goes to 20 SP 580 TLT. The point is, this can be modulated to whatever you need based on your needs. However, for the traders, this is when things start getting serious. You are going to have to create that trading plan that I was telling about. You are going to have to start paper trading to figure out what works for you. So if you are going down this trading route, this is a whole other world that I will create a second video for you on that dives into that specifically.
