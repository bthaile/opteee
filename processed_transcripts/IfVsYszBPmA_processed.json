    "text": "ah, Goldilocks analysis. This is a term that I made up to talk and reference the thing we all do, which is when we place a trade, we really like to think about all the things we're going to do as it's going in our direction as things are working beautifully. It's easy to think about that. The tough part of the trade is actually putting yourself in a scenario and visualizing and thinking through what it might look like if it goes terribly. And it's a little bit of a exposure therapy style process because once you get used to doing it, it's really not that bad. But for a lot of people, they'll say things like, oh, if I sell a put down here and I get assigned, I would love that. I'm getting it at such a discount. Until the stock goes to that goes below it, keeps crashing below it because conditions have changed and now it's a completely different thing. But we didn't think through that because we're too focused on the scenarios that we think sound good. So, avoid Goldilocks analysis. Be an outlier. See you later.",
