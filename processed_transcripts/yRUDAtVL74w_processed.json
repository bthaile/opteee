    "text": "hey everyone eric here wanted to follow up on a really good conversation i was having with one of the members of my facebook group on why think or swim is lying to you and what i want to talk about is iv rank versus iv percentile although they're used interchangeably these are completely different calculations and it's important to understand that in the way that they're calculated to know how we can use them one is far better than the other and i'll explain why during normal market conditions these two are very similar which is why they're used interchangeably you know people just synonyms essentially and they don't really pay respect to the difference between the two but when we see really large outlier moves like we saw when the market crashed earlier this year that's when their the difference in their computation becomes super apparent and it's important for us as traders to understand that difference because it will completely change the way you approach a trade so what i have here is a snapshot from thinkorswim took it right before this video on today's option statistics which is under the trade tab below all of the options chains and this is for tesla so what this is showing you is it says current iv percentile is 30 it's completely false it's not 30 that is a lie literally bold phase completely incorrect that is iv rank and i'm gonna explain over the next couple slides here",
