And then the other big piece of news stems from the Iran Israel slash US conflict. And this actually is led to some of the more profound recent changes that we've seen in oil prices, which has been massively tradable. The oil futures right now are showing down 4.5 percent. Gold is down a point in a quarter, Bitcoin up 2 VIX down 2.9 NASDAQ, Russell and E-minis all are up right now, which is actually also kind of interesting because they're being led by the Russell. And the Russell's been the week one of the group by far. Now let's start with kind of the the easy one I suppose, which is the the ceasefire. This looks like one of those instances where the market had this completely correct, literally completely correct. I made a post about it earlier that I thought was genuinely entertaining. I made a post. I think it was on X. Let me see when it was because the yeah, it was seven hours ago. So this is when I ran Walter Bloomberg posted that I ran",

So this is when I ran Walter Bloomberg posted that I ran launched attacks targeting Qatar and Iraq. And the markets literally were up. And I actually found that to be extremely telling, extremely telling the fact that the markets were rallying despite that going on to me told me that the the market itself really was not that concerned with what this conflict is where it was at. And then obviously an expectation of some sort of less impactful resolution. This is one of those cases where the market it can be really good as a guiding feature honestly to analyze information that's coming out because at face value, seeing that original tweet from Bloomberg, I'm sitting there thinking like, okay, yeah, this is obviously going the wrong way. This is escalating. However, the market is pretty detailed and it's good at pricing things. Stop that. So because of that, the market led me to reassess the initial reaction that I had. And sure enough, the market seemed to have some pretty good ideas. So let's see what the latest is. This is from AP and Dubai.

It says Trump announced Israel and I ran a grid to a complete and total ceasefire soon after Iran launched a limited missile attack on a US military base and Qatar retaliating for the bombing of the nuclear sites. So the reason why this is interesting is because the way this whole thing went down, it shows how much just showmanship is going on. The US makes this attack with beetles, bombs a few spots. And then the US first postures and says any sort of attack against US interests will be, it'll just lead to pretty significant escalation. And that leaves Iran with essentially no way out. There's no real way out of that. Because if Iran doesn't do anything and they just get punched in the lip and they don't do anything, that absolutely devastates their sovereignty after somebody bombs them on their soil. So then the fact that they opened that up and essentially said, if you attack back, this is going to lead to an escalation. But then the US obviously had a backdoor conversation with Iran because I ran communicated to the US that they were going to attack some of these spots which led to us leaving those spots and then the attack unfolding with preemptive warning. So that clearly is just all showmanship that's Iran essentially saying",

And that's essentially clearly what happened. So I think this broadly circles back to what makes the most sense, which is some sort of broad scale conflict over here that it just doesn't help anybody or anything. And I think the reason why the US got involved is to show Iran that they're going to have to do something because Iran was obviously very comfortable continuing the conflict with Israel. And Israel was happy to play the game as well. So by the US entering the conversation, player three enters the game, the dynamic changes a little bit. And now we are seemingly at a ceasefire. So the market effect here is pretty interesting. If we take a look at just the broad market effect, we got to go to the futures here specifically. And if you take a look at crude, crude has had one of the most insane moves that I've seen in crude oil for some time now. So zooming in on this, you can see that we rally from 60. We get up to",

And then we now have one of the largest intraday than follow on two day selloffs that effectively that we've seen in recent history with crude massive move. This also comes from a very clear priority of Trump who does not want expensive oil. He's made that super, super clear. And this is some level of partial alignment there. So what's the tradable output here? I see a few things. One of them is it does seem like this is going to be a weight off the market shoulders. You can see that things are rallying right now. I actually have some long Russell futures on just playing this after hours move. And we'll see how it actually ends up how it actually ends up panning out. But right now the Russell is leading the pack. And that is an important data point because it shows a broader underlying shift.

It's more fun than creating videos, but unfortunately live streams don't do a lot for the channel in terms of growth. The YouTube algorithm doesn't really promote live streams, which makes a lot of sense. All right. So let's take a look and dive into our next key piece, which is what are the tradable effects here? First tradable effect, I think we noted is the Russell. Okay. Next tradable effect is still the continued move in crude. I don't think crude is fully done. I'm short futures. I think that there's still probably downside, which is likely to be like the 60s low 60 handle. And that's about where I'm expecting it to be. So I have a short that I'm running in there right now that I'll continue to let that go. But I think short oil is another another spot. A couple others, I think gold is reeling back a little bit right now. I think this largely comes from the risk on risk off relationship, because if we take a look at ETF flows for the day, which I haven't looked at yet, but my guess is that we will probably see capital inflows. That would be my guess. Capital inflows, essentially across the entire board. So yeah, about as expected. So what that tells me is just there will be some money that's positioning more risk",

Again, one of the things that people, I've heard a few people say is like, oh man, like they're so tired of like the news cycle. It's too much. They can't keep up. But the reality is there's actually some significant benefits to the way that the news cycle is with Trump, the administration and in general, is that it forces stuff all over the place. So the whole game of like deep insider information will always be at play. But this kind of flow of information does level the playing field to a degree. Because it I've said this before, it just becomes an equal game of like nobody knows. So the fact that this morning I ran was shooting missiles and that this afternoon slash evening, depending on if you're East Coast time, that there's now a piece of agreement, right? It's kind of kind of crazy. Normally, there would at least be a couple more days in between those I would imagine. So this also means that I think the broad market attention shifts a lot.

And then we're coming up on another earning cycle, which starts in a couple weeks. So that'll likely be the more dominant direction that we see things now starting to focus. Okay. So now let's take a quick look at the robot taxi. Kill these. The robot taxi is really, really interesting. It's one of those things where it's fun to see the kinds of ideas that Tesla dreams up and what this could look like. It's obviously still very much in its infancy, just like autonomous driving. The reality is autonomous driving is still a long ways off. Even though out here in California, you'll see a bunch of Tesla's that are on the highway doing a great job managing that. And I do think it's the technology is developing rapidly. But with how unscripted so much of this is, meaning day to day driving, it is something to pay attention to. A great example of this. I had a buddy out visiting and we were driving the new Tesla performance model, whatever that one is. I don't remember.

And the repercussions for a mistake go up significantly. So I think that's going to be one of the bigger issues that they face is like if I were to use this kind of service, it would only be in like short little local stuff out of curiosity.

Only a small number of cars heavy human supervision on and off the road exactly as you would expect.

This is the this is the the issue that they have is again, it's going to be these small little hurdles like this that make it more difficult for this to work. Now zooming out though, there's a really, really interesting opportunity where if we look at what this means for companies like Uber and companies like Lyft, they're effectively on notice and Uber itself is really not in a super great position right now. And they're going to need to pivot really quickly in order to be able to make this broader this broader thing work, which I haven't seen much of the news around Uber and how they're attempting to deal with the rise of the robot taxi because their model really isn't built for adaptation or taking up the robot taxi business model. So I don't see them as an operator for it. They could be or they could be consumed, but even that the main benefit to a company like Uber is that they get to offload a lot of cost and risk because you're essentially using contractors. You have people that are operating their personal vehicles and that decreases a ton of the logistical burden on the company, which makes it a really slick idea. And I don't see that fully",

Now, the other thing to keep in mind is I don't actually think that there's going to be some sort of at least several year removal of these kinds of companies because when I fly relatively frequently and if I'm going to a normal airport, I almost always see a row of regular cabs still there. So the fact that there's still even regular cabs is kind of crazy. So I don't see the robot taxi taking too much away from Uber, at least in the very near term, although they do have they do have some big strategic decisions that they're going to have to navigate, which I don't imagine are going to be super easy for them. So Josh says, have taken a regular cab when Uber wait times were too long. Yeah, which is really interesting. Like the fact that there's still a market for that kind of thing because normally speaking, I always preemptively time it because I know that they wait five minutes. So I will order them early Uber or lift, I'll order them early and have them have them wait. I'd rather them wait for me for three minutes than me",

So I'm having to leave the house at like five. And I'll schedule the lift ahead of time.

Well, the problem is is my ride wasn't available. And then there's no other providers in the region. One of the things that cabs do well is like they're reliable if you scheduled them ahead of time.

It's really just because Tesla's been an absolute crap. So yeah, that's this position, which looks pretty good. The Palantir ratio called diagonal is looking good. I am getting to a point, though, where I likely will need to adjust it ever so slightly. Oops, didn't mean to click that. Let me get that out of the way. That's like just all those off. I will likely need to adjust it ever so slightly because of the short call component is not where we need it. So I have two different tranches out of short calls. I have the 140s and the 155s.

Lauren says, didn't you shut the discord down for a bit because of the bots? Oh, that's what you mean. Start it. Now I understand stacks. And thank you for Lauren for helping me understand. Yes. So the flow is different though. The way that people get into the discord is through the free side of the Patreon. It essentially allows us to conduct a slightly better review and have a tighter onboarding process. So it's for free, everybody to get into the Patreon community. That was, it just adds an additional step to make it more difficult for the bots to get in because it's not even bots really. It's spammers. They're live people that we're trying to scam people, which is super annoying. So Lauren, you're exactly correct. So far, it's been better. We'll obviously keep an eye on it because if it gets bad again, then we'll have to turn it off. But so far, it's been okay. Thankfully. So yeah, thank you for the, thank you for the heads up. I want to take a look at TSSI specifically here. And I just want to get a sense",

I just don't feel like doing that. So I want to like focus in either on a key sub component and do like a four or six episode mini series on it. So pretty open, pretty open to ideas depending on what you might want to look at. Okay, so back to this. Let's take a look at. So again, this is just looking at stuff that's up big over the last year. This I have a position in, but need some updates. Let's see what these options look like. Yeah, so still pretty good call skew, really, really light options chain. And this is looking at S E Z L. I have changed this fucking boom arm thing. Need to get like one that just sits on the desk. Let's take a look at the options. So the options chain is actually quieting down a lot. Let's take a look at the net premiums. So still super heavy on the call side though.

He's like very interested in momentum. And in his book, he talks about three different types of momentum. There's more than three, but here are three short term long term intermediate. And it gives you the requisite lookback periods for these. So short term is a month look back long term five years or 60 months intermediate is one year look back. And what they do is they start from a really solid position, which is what I always recommend to you as traders is review the existing research. Anytime that we think about trying to trade something, we should review the existing research. That's what you do in any sort of research based approach. That's exactly what they do here.

This is an important effect. If you trade momentum, this is a very important effect for you to be aware of. And then it says those stocks with negative returns in the prior week, typically at prior returns the next week. So this is just looking at broad data samples and coming up with general trends. But this is a reversion style approach. Next by Jagadish. For those that don't know in terms of momentum, Jagadish has a bunch of papers. A lot of really great work. And it says that they find similar reversal in returns last month winners or next month's losers and vice versa. So the effect is large and significant. So there's literally a tradable effect right here. You can trade short term reversals on momentum.

So again, what you can do is you can sort things that have had a negative return over the last month with the expectation of at least some sort of positive recovery return on the following month. And you can test all this stuff on your own. And then this goes further into detail on these different kinds of reversion. So here it's again, it summarizes pretty clearly. It says key takeaway short term winners or losers in the near term future short term losers or winners in the near term future. Overall momentum over a short time horizon one can expect to see a reversal in short term returns. And then is you zoom this out over a longer time that obviously will begin to change. So the concept of momentum is really important. And when I'm studying stuff like this, there's a really slick way to think about this then. So we can take a look at stuff that's a big over the last month. And then maybe we can speculate that it doesn't necessarily go down, but might not have as strong as a following month or at least a couple of week period if things start looking overextended. So that's one really simple approach. Then you can play longer term continuation ideas and stuff like that.

Lauren says deeper dive into selling calls and puts. I think that would be good. I think like something about selling options could be really good because a lot of people like to sell options. I think maybe that would also be like a really good series to try to help those in theta gang understand like the risk that's in front of them because a lot of them really don't I think fully appreciate what they're doing and the implications of what they're doing. That could be a really good one. Let's take a look at L.E.U. really fast. So L.E.U. popped up actually from a little bit of research I was doing on nuclear investment opportunities. I posted the summation of that research for the pro members in the discourse. You can see like actual the out brief that I built iterating with Gemini a little bit on the concept.

But this stock flagged for a couple different reasons and it's because they have a very interesting positioning in the broader nuclear theme. So when and for those that don't know this is like the funnest part about the stock market to me is you get a chance to learn about a ton of stuff. You're never going to be a full expert in any of it but you'll have a rudimentary understanding of a ton of things which I actually really really enjoy. So one of the things that I was learning about today was this concept of enrichment and the concept of HALU, H-A-L-E-U which is high assay low enriched uranium which is a next generation fuel essential for many advanced reactor designs. So the interesting thing is with this companies like L.E.U. are actually really really well positioned because L.E.U. is the central player in the U.S. to solve the HALU problem. And they right now are one of the this part right here. It's strategic advantage is that it operates the only facility in the U.S. licensed by NRC to produce HALU. This gives centrist of de facto monopoly on the domestic market making it indispensable partner for the entire advanced reactor industry. So it places it at a really interesting crossroad. So the idea here then to me is okay, well let's see what the market is saying inside here",

But if we take a look at the actual options chain for L.E.U. just to see what broader positioning trends we might be able to detect we can see that the call side is significantly heavier in terms of premium than the put side. So the call side is 2.4 against 1.5 903 against 543 825 against 261. So a lot of the puts that I see that are coming out are at really interesting levels some of them represents synthetic stock positions to me. But you can see in the the longer run that overall call skew continues. So that in and of itself is a pretty interesting skew.

Now if we take a look at the actual I'm looking for here this if we take a look at just some of the random reports that exist this is one of the things I actually like by the way about thinkorswim is that it cleanly links to stuff like this. So we can see that that there's a pretty long bias at least from market edge. I don't know market edge long term long term success rate. So I never really look at these individual ones too heavily. I just wanted to pop in and see what they wrote about more often than not what I care about is the overall analyst rating not so much any individual one. So we can take a look at that in one of these two spots I think here. And let's go to L.E.U. So I don't know how many this is which is actually kind of important to me. How many is this? One two three four five six. 15 entries but with multiple of them being from B. Riley the same entity. So this is interesting because when you go back to the momentum factor a big part of momentum is actually in information discreetness or indiscreteness. And when things are less covered they tend to have more growth potential which is actually quite interesting. So this looks like it's just starting to gain broader traction on the larger larger stage so",

So what I'm doing is I'm just getting a sense of where their book comes from Uranium's 103 mil contract services 541 product 315. And net income let's take a look year over year. So Q1 against Q1 is pretty strong. Let's take a look at Q2 54 mil against year over year Q2 which isn't Q3 in my bad sorry. Oh no Q2 is here in my bad my bad my bad. This is Q4 Q3 here's Q2 so Q2 was 31 mil in 2024 13 so year over year it's growing Q4 of 23 was 56 mil 54 mil so that's good. Revenue expanding like that year over year is really good. Receivables going up is good. I mean this looks interesting to me so we'll keep this on the list. So what is this 23 June? L.E.U. This would be like long calls. So now let's actually just poke through these really fast and see how the prior prior ideas have been panning out.

So first one is GE we looked at this on 25 May here and this was a bullish idea so really two solid exits that one's working just fine next is SMR this was also on 25 May so even with the pullbacks this is still looking absolutely fine. Duke energy this was long calls on 25 May this one I think is a loser it would have been entry here so even though it's technically up a little I still would call it a loser because this didn't go the direction that it should be going that being said this looks interesting from a risk premium lens now that I'm looking at it. Yeah I kind of like this oh yeah that's the other thing I wanted to do so I wanted to update one of these labels this one I want to update this so that I can look at the percentage of time for the window looked at that there's risk premium so update this script having chat GPT to update this script so in the VRP label at the end",
