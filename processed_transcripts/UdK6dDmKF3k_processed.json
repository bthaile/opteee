And this actually is led to some of the more profound recent changes that we've seen in oil prices, which has been massively tradable. The oil futures right now are showing down 4.5. Gold is down a point and a quarter bit coin up 2 VIX down 2.9 NASDAQ, Russell and E minis all are up right now, which is actually also kind of interesting because they're being led by the Russell. And the Russell's been the week one of the group by far. Now let's start with kind of the easy one I suppose, which is the cease fire. This looks like one of those instances where the market had this completely correct, literally completely correct. I made a post about it earlier that I thought was like genuinely entertaining. I made a post, I think it was on X. Let me see when it was because the yeah, it was seven hours ago. So this is when I ran Walter Bloomberg posted that I ran launched attacks targeting Qatar and Iraq. And the markets literally were up. And I actually found that to be extremely telling, extremely telling the fact that the markets were rallying despite that going on to me told me that the market itself really was not that concerned with what this conflict is where it",

And then obviously an expectation of some sort of less impactful resolution. This is one of those cases where the market, it can be really good as a guiding feature honestly to analyze information that's coming out because at face value, seeing that original tweet from Bloomberg, I'm sitting there thinking like, okay, yeah, this is obviously going the wrong way. This is escalating. However, the market is pretty detailed and it's good at pricing things. So because of that, the market led me to reassess the initial reaction that I had. And sure enough, the market seemed to have some pretty good ideas. So let's see what the latest is. This is from AP in Dubai. It says Trump announced Israel and Iran agreed to a complete and total ceasefire. Soon after Iran launched a limited missile attack on a US military base in Qatar retaliating for the bombing of the nuclear sites. So the reason why this is interesting is that the US military base in Qatar is not so the reason why this is interesting is because the way this whole thing went down, it shows how much just showmanship is going on.

The US makes this attack with beetles, bombs, a few spots. And then the US first postures and says any sort of attack against US interests. This will be, you know, it'll just lead to pretty significant escalation. And that leaves Iran with essentially no way out. There's no real way out of that because if Iran doesn't do anything and they just get punched in the lip and they don't do anything, that absolutely devastates their sovereignty after somebody bombs them on their soil. So then the fact that they opened that up and essentially said, eh, you know, if you attack back, this is going to lead to an escalation. But then the US obviously had a backdoor conversation with Iran because Iran communicated to the US that they were going to attack some of these spots which led to us leaving those spots and then the attack unfolding with preemptive warning. So that clearly is just all showmanship. That's Iran essentially saying like, listen, we got to do something here. Otherwise we look exceedingly weak. So let's agree for what we can do here. And that's essentially clearly what happened. So I think this broadly circles back to what",

So I think this broadly circles back to what makes the most sense, which is some sort of broad scale conflict over here that it just doesn't help anybody or anything. And I think the reason why the US got involved is to show Iran that they're going to have to do something because Iran was obviously very comfortable continuing the conflict with Israel. And Israel was happy to play the game as well. So by the US entering the conversation, player three enters the game, the dynamic changes a little bit. And now we are seemingly at a ceasefire. So the market effect here is pretty interesting. If we take a look at just the broad market effect, we got to go to the futures here specifically. And if you take a look at crude, crude has had one of the most insane moves that I've seen in crude oil for some time now. So zooming in on this, you can see that we rally from 60. We get up to the mid 70s. We almost crack 80. And then we now have one of the largest intraday than follow on two day selloffs that effectively that we've seen in recent history with crude massive move. This also",

This also comes from a very clear priority of Trump who does not want expensive oil. He's made that super, super clear. And this is some level of partial alignment there. So what's the tradable output here? I see a few things. One of them is it does seem like this is going to be a weight off the market shoulders. You can see that things are rallying right now. I actually have some long Russell futures on just playing this after hours move. We'll see how it actually ends up how it actually ends up panning out. But right now the Russell is leading the pack. And that is an important data point because it shows a broader underlying shift because if you take a look at the Russell, the Russell's been the under performer for some time now. NASDAQ is within striking distance of all time highs. E-minis are within striking distance of all time highs. NASDAQ is still a ways off even from the 2300 handle with it trading around 2166.

There wasn't really anything that looked too good to me. Now one quick admin note for those that are watching this live, we found a way to essentially be able to let people dial in to the stream. So if you're in the discord and you want an opportunity to dial in, I'll have time a little bit later for Open QA, but all you need to do is go into the chat room, the voice chat room in the discord, which it's free for everybody. You can go into the chat room and then effectively I can join and then stream the conversation from there. So it comes through here. So there's a way for us to do kind of like live QA and conversation, which I want to start integrating into these. So this first one, it'll be obviously working out the details. But if you are interested in doing that, you can let me know in the chat. So then I'll monitor the chat room",

Hey, yo, what's up? Lauren T.C.M. King says, how do you, I don't usually watch live. You catch them later at 2X. Yeah, that's kind of the standard, I actually think for a lot of people because most of the live streams funny enough, they get most of their views in the recording side of stuff, which leads me to believe sometimes I think I might try another pilot soon where I literally just do more videos instead of the live streams. I like the live streams because I actually just enjoy hanging out with you guys. It's more fun than creating videos. But unfortunately, live streams don't do a lot for the channel in terms of growth. The YouTube algorithm doesn't really promote live streams, which makes a lot of sense. All right. So let's take a look and dive into our next key piece, which is what are the tradable effects here? First tradable effect I think we noted is the Russell. Okay. Next tradable effect",

Next tradable effect is still the continued move in crude. I don't think crude is fully done. I'm short futures. I think that there's still probably downside, which is likely to be like the 60s low 60 handle. And that's about where I'm expecting it to be. So I have a short that I'm running in there right now that I'll continue to let that go. But I think short oil is another another spot. A couple others. I think gold is reeling back a little bit right now. I think this largely comes from the risk on risk off relationship because if we take a look at ETF flows for the day, which I haven't looked at yet. But my guess is that we will probably see capital inflows. That would be my guess. Capital inflows. Probably across the entire board. So yeah, about as expected. So what that tells me is just there will be some money that's positioning more risk on. And that's kind of the cool part.

But the reality is there's actually some significant benefits to the way that the news cycle is with Trump, the administration and in general. Is that it forces stuff all over the place. So the whole game of like deep insider information will always be at play. But this kind of flow of information does level the playing field to a degree because it I've said this before it just becomes an equal game of like nobody knows. So the fact that this morning I ran was shooting missiles and that this afternoon slash evening, depending on if you're East Coast time. That there's now a peace agreement, right? It's kind of kind of crazy. Normally there would at least be a couple more days in between those I would imagine. So this also means that I think the broad market attention shifts a lot. I think the market will start to shift its attention more so to the Fed picture. And then we're coming up on another earning cycle, which starts in a couple weeks.

It's one of those things where it's fun to see the kinds of ideas that Tesla dreams up and what this could look like. It's obviously still very much in its infancy just like autonomous driving. The reality is autonomous driving is still a long ways off. Even though out here in California, you'll see a bunch of Teslas that are on the highway, doing a great job managing that. And I do think it's the technology is developing rapidly. But with how unscripted so much of this is, meaning day to day driving, it is something to pay attention to. Great example of this. I had a buddy out visiting and we were driving the new Tesla performance model, whatever that one is. I don't remember. And I was tinkering with it because you know, as I'm a gear head, I like cars, I build cars, I drive cars, I have a car club, like cars. And I was driving it and it was the automated driving is just very impressive what it can do. However, the thing tried to fucking kill me and three other people",

So what ended up happening is we were coming on the on ramp. The extra lane to the right was gone because of construction. It had like one of those cement barriers. So we're getting ready to come on the highway at a pretty good rate of speed. And then there's somebody in front in that lane that we were emerging into. And then there was somebody directly speeding up along the merge lane that we should be getting over. And the car literally had us accelerating into this trifecta where there is a car in front of me, the guard rail to the right and then a car that was speeding up to the left. So I don't know if slash when the Tesla was going to correct. I was monitoring pretty closely. So I gave it as much time as I felt comfortable before intervening. And I ended up having to get on the brakes like pretty damn hard because I waited a while to see if it would intervene and it hadn't at that point. So who knows Tesla,",

But all of the passengers got pretty jostled because I was explaining to them what I was doing. And they got pretty jostled when I made the correction myself. So all of that's to say one single anecdote. We drove that car most of the time that it was here and most of the time most fantastic. But that's the problem. That's the issue that's automated driving faces. It's not the fact that it's going to get it right 95 of the time. It's that it's going to be judged on the 5 it gets wrong. And that's a difficult threshold to get over as a company. That's not easy. So I think the technology itself is fascinating. It's well developing.

It is literally a genuine roll of the die who you get. I've had some really awesome drivers. I probably have had equal number of not good drivers. And I don't pick the cheap option when I use them. I'm typically picking one of the more expensive choices. So that's just to de-conflict sometimes people when I will tell them that kind of thing they'll say like, oh, that's just because you're doing like the economic one. And it's not the case. I'm typically not. The point I'm making here is that I imagine this standard ride quality is going to go up massively across the board. Because if you can successfully automate this, that does make a big difference. I would use the service. Now I would use the service once it's fully stabilized. Because right now there's no way that I would feel comfortable getting in the back of an automated driving vehicle. Unless like if I was going to short this then sure who cares.

But I'm thinking stuff like going from my house to like the airport where you're spending a decent amount of time on the five in California, which for those that don't know, it's a fast highway. It's not like the Northeast style highways where the speed limits like 55 and people speed at like 65 or 70. It's literally like the flow of traffic typically is 85. And like that's not even being dramatic. It's literally like 85. So the issue with that is that the margin for error goes down pretty significantly. And the repercussions for a mistake go up significantly. So I think that's going to be one of the bigger issues that they face is like if I were to use this kind of service, it would only be in like short little local stuff out of curiosity.

It says the first robot taxi rides are running into a few bumps. Tesla launches robot taxi service over the weekend. Only a small number of cars heavy human supervision on and off the road exactly as you would expect. All less impressive than previously promised the company's caution ultimately seems for the best. I don't know why that would be unimpressive. Like that makes total sense to me. At least one robot taxi attempted to drive on the wrong side of the road based on a video posted to X and spotted by Bloomberg. The ride video shared by Rob Mar is largely an eventful Tesla navigating turns merges view issues except for around seven minutes or so under the ride. This is the issue that they have is again, it's going to be these small little hurdles like this that make it more difficult for this to work. Now zooming out though, there's a really, really interesting opportunity where if we look at what this means for companies like Uber and companies like Lyft, they're effectively on notice. And Uber",

Now zooming out though, there's a really, really interesting opportunity where if we look at what this means for companies like Uber and companies like Lyft, they're effectively on notice. And Uber itself is really not in a super great position right now and they're going to need to pivot really quickly in order to be able to make this broader, this broader thing to work, which I haven't seen much of the news around Uber and how they're attempting to deal with the rise of the robot taxi because their model really isn't built for adaptation or taking up the robot taxi business model. So I don't see them as an operator for it. They could be or they could be consumed. But even that, the main benefit to a company like Uber is that they get to offload a lot of cost and risk because you're essentially using contractors. You have people that are operating their personal vehicles and that decreases a ton of the logistical burden on the company, which makes it a really slick idea. And I don't see that fully going away. The other thing to keep in mind is I don't actually think that there's going to be some sort of at least several year removal of these kinds of companies because when I fly relatively frequently and if I'm going to a normal airport, I",

The other thing to keep in mind is I don't actually think that there's going to be some sort of at least several year removal of these kinds of companies because when I fly relatively frequently and if I'm going to a normal airport, I almost always see a row of regular cabs still there. So the fact that there's still even regular cabs is kind of crazy. I don't see the robot taxi taking too much away from Uber, at least in the very near term, although they do have some big strategic decisions that they're going to have to navigate, which I don't imagine are going to be super easy for them. Josh says, have taken a regular cab when Uber wait times were too long? Yeah, which is really interesting, right? Like the fact that there's still a market for that kind of thing because normally speaking, I always preemptively time it because I know that they wait five minutes. I will order them early Uber or Lyft. I'll order them early and have them wait. I'd rather them wait for me for three minutes than me wait for them for three minutes. I'm going to value my time over their time and that's one of the benefits of the service.

I had this a while ago where I scheduled this is when I was consulting with Deloitte. I used to fly pretty much every week. And when I would sometimes have to leave really early on a Monday, so I'm having to leave the house at like five. And I'll schedule the lift ahead of time. But then the lift driver the next morning will be like, man, fuck that. I don't feel like getting up anymore. Maybe they go out, have too much a drink. Well, the problem is, is my ride wasn't available and then there's no other providers in the region. One of the things that cabs do well is like they're reliable if you scheduled them ahead of time. For that, realistically, you're better off just using a driving service, but that's a whole other thing. When I was working at Deloitte, you can't expense a driving service. So I still think Tesla here, you can see that it really enjoyed that news. And I still have the ratio called diagonal on in Tesla, where my base position is out in 15 Jan 27.

So those still look pretty good to me. Now, Admin, no, I'm going to take a look through a few more things. But if you want to dial into the stream, you can hop into the chat room and just ping me in the discord and then I'll pop over and then I'll be able to put you on. So that's you can literally talk live if there's a question or something that you want to take a look at. Just let me know and you will be on the stream, just like dialing into show, which is pretty cool. Zach says, what are your strikes for 27 on the calls, the long calls I'm at the 420s? Yes. So let's take a look at where those are at. The 420s are a 59 delta. So I got those when they were a bit lower. And the 18 July. The 375s. So these are underwater a little bit.

So yeah, that's this position, which looks pretty good. The Palantir ratio call diagonal is looking good. I am getting to a point though, where I likely will need to adjust it ever so slightly. Oops, didn't mean to click that. Let me get that out of the way. That's like just all those off. I will likely need to adjust it ever so slightly because of the short call component is not where we need it. So I have two different tranches out of short calls. I have the 140s and the 155s. The 140s are in 18 July. And those were out for 638. So I'm probably going to have to roll those realistically speaking. And yeah, the 140s, but the problem is that they still have so much extra intrinsic value. And they're only at a 56 delta. So it might not. Stax says, are you back on discord for the Patreon members?

Anyways, we're not going to go super deep in a detail. We'll do a little bit more of that tomorrow on the pro stream. That's really where I spend most of my time like actually trying to configure individual trades. I'm mostly going to use this as an opportunity to create short lists for stuff that's likely worth following up on. So what I'm going to do now is start with just a few basic scans. The first one I'm looking at things that are up the most over the last year. This helps me with momentum and stuff like that. So TSSI is primary leader and they're up 1,261 over the last year. So these guys are I mean, absolutely crushing it. Insane. And let's take a look at the options here. Lauren says, didn't you shut the discord down for a bit because of the bots?

The way that people get into the discord is through the free side of the Patreon. It essentially allows us to conduct a slightly better review and have a tighter onboarding process. So it's for free, everybody to get into the Patreon community. That was it just adds an additional step to make it more difficult for the bots to get in because yeah, the and it's not even bots really. It's spammers. They're live people that we're trying to scam people, which is super annoying. So Lauren, you're exactly correct. So far, it's been better. We'll obviously keep an eye on it because if it gets bad again, then we'll have to turn it off. But so far, it's been okay. Thankfully. So yeah, thank you for the, thank you for the heads up.

The other thing that I do want to throw out for specifically those that attend the Friday sessions, the beginner, really, the options trading basics, it's coming up on time to like actually reconfigure the series for the next mini series.

So if you attend those beginner, the beginner streams on Friday, if there are specific elements of options trading that you want to focus on, please let me know either in the discord in the chat here, wherever, because that will give me ideas on what we should do for the next mini series. Because I don't really want to do like a reboot of the actual 101 yet, going back to like the very basics. I just don't feel like doing that.

Let's see what these options look like. Yeah, so still pretty good call skew, really, really light options chain. And this is looking at if change this fucking boom, arm thing, you need to get like one that just sits on the desk. Let's take a look at the options. So the options chain is actually quieting down a lot. Let's take a look at the net premiums. So still super heavy on the call side though. Wow, and a bunch of it's right on the front, in it. ET July, look at that 928 K again 71 439 and 436. So this is very much in the front end. Interesting. So this gets earmarked. I'm going to add this to my actual watchlist.

And in his book, he talks about three different types of momentum. There's more than three, but here are three short term long term intermediate. And it gives you the requisite lookback periods for these. So short term is a month lookback long term five years or 60 months intermediate is one year look back. And what they do is they start from a really solid position, which is what I always recommend to you as traders is review the existing research. Anytime that we think about trying to trade something, we should review the existing research. That's what you do in any sort of research-based approach. That's exactly what they do here because it's fucking smart. It decreases the total amount of work you have to do because you can pick up where things have been left off. Okay. So they cite a paper by Lehman and it says that that paper, which is from 62 to 86, so a really long study, but in a dated market regime, it says finds that portfolios of securities that had positive returns in the prior week, typically a negative returns in the next week. This is an important effect. If you trade momentum, this is a very important effect for you to be aware of. And then it says those stocks with negative",

If you trade momentum, this is a very important effect for you to be aware of. And then it says those stocks with negative returns in the prior week, typically at prior returns the next week. So this is just looking at broad data samples and coming up with general trends, but this is a reversion style approach. Next by Jagadish for those that don't know in terms of momentum, Jagadish has a bunch of papers, a lot of really great work. And it says that they find similar reversal in returns last month winners or next month's losers and vice versa. So the effect is large and significant. So there's literally a tradable effect right here. You can trade short-term reversals on momentum. So again, what you can do is you can sort things that have had a negative return over the last month with the expectation of at least some sort of positive recovery return on the following month. And you can test all this stuff on your own. And then this goes further into detail on these different kinds of reversion. So here it's, again, it summarizes pretty clearly. It says key takeaway, short-term winners or losers in the near-term future, short-term losers or winners in the near-term future. Overall momentum over a short time horizon one can expect to see",

It says key takeaway, short-term winners or losers in the near-term future, short-term losers or winners in the near-term future. Overall momentum over a short time horizon one can expect to see a reversal in short-term returns. And then as you zoom this out over a longer time, that obviously will begin to change. So the concept of momentum is really important. And when I'm studying stuff like this, there's a really slick way to think about this then. So we can take a look at stuff that's up big over the last month. And then maybe we can speculate that it doesn't necessarily go down but might not have as strong as a following month or at least a couple of week period if things start looking overextended. So that's one really simple approach. Then you can play longer-term continuation ideas and stuff like that. That just gives you some context on why I'm using the scans that I am because it walks me into those kinds of ideas based on what the portfolio needs more broadly. Lauren says deeper dive into selling calls and puts. I think that would be good. I think like something about selling options could be really good because a lot of people like to sell options. I think maybe that would also be like a really good series to try to help those in theta",

That could be a really good one. Let's take a look at L.E.U. really fast. So L.E.U popped up actually from a little bit of research I was doing on nuclear investment opportunities. I posted the summation of that research for the pro members and the discourse you can see like actual the outpourief that I built iterating with Gemini a little bit on the concept but this stock flagged for a couple different reasons and it's because they have a very interesting positioning in the broader nuclear theme. So when and for those that don't know this is like the funnest part about the stock market to me is you get a chance to learn about a ton of stuff. You're never going to be a full expert in any of it but you'll have a rudimentary understanding of a ton of things which I actually really really enjoy. So one of the things that I was learning about today was this concept of enrichment and the concept",

So one of the things that I was learning about today was this concept of enrichment and the concept of HALU HALE.U which is high essay low enriched uranium which is a next generation fuel essential for many advanced reactor designs. So the interesting thing is with this companies like L.E.U. are actually really really well positioned because L.E.U. is the central player in the U.S. to solve the HALU problem and they right now are one of the this part right here. It's strategic advantage is that it operates the only facility in the U.S. licensed by NRC to produce HALU. This gives centrist of de facto monopoly on the domestic market making it indispensable partner for the entire advanced reactor industry. So it places it at a really interesting crossroad. So the idea here then to me is okay well let's see what the market is saying inside here which based on total O.I. it's about same same yet when we take a look at puts you're noticing a bunch of these puts being sold on the day which are people either gaining entry via short puts or people that were just directly wrong getting shaken out. But if we take a look at the actual options chain for L.E.U. just to see what broader positioning trends",

But if we take a look at the actual options chain for L.E.U. just to see what broader positioning trends we might be able to detect. We can see that the call side is significantly heavier in terms of premium than the so the call side is 2.4 against 1.5 903 against 543 825 against 261 so a lot of the puts that I see that are coming out are at really interesting levels some of them represents synthetic stock positions to me. But you can see in the longer run that overall call skew continues. So that in and of itself is a pretty interesting skew. Now if we take a look at the actual I'm not looking for here this if we take a look at just some of the random reports that exist this is one of the things actually like by the way about thinkorswim is that it cleanly links to stuff like this. So we can see that there's a pretty long bias at least from market edge I don't know market edge long term long term success rate so I never really look at these individual ones too heavily I just wanted to pop in and see what they wrote about more often than not what I care about is the overall analyst rating",

So we can take a look at that in one of these two spots I think here. And let's go to L.E.U. So I don't know how many this is which is actually kind of important to me. How many is this? One two three four five six. 15 entries but with multiple of them being from b Riley the same entity. So this is interesting because when you go back to the momentum factor a big part of momentum is actually in information discreetness or indiscreteness and when things are less covered they tend to have more growth potential which is actually quite interesting. So this looks like it's just starting to gain broader traction on the larger larger stage so to speak. And if we take a look at their financials let's see. So what I'm doing is I'm just getting a sense of where their book comes from Uranium's 103 mill contract services 541 product 315 and net income let's take a look year over year. So Q1 against Q1 is pretty strong let's take a look at Q2 54 mill against year over year Q2 which isn't Q3 in my",

Revenue expanding like that year over year is really good. Receivables going up is good. I mean this looks interesting to me so we'll keep this on the list so what is this 23 June? LEU? This would be like long calls. So now let's actually just poke through these really fast and see how the prior prior ideas have been panning out I'm going to move this out of the way so I can just go faster but you can see what's here now and I'm just going to flip through them and see how things are going. So first one is GE we looked at this on 25 May here and this was a bullish idea so really two solid exits that ones working just fine. Next is SMR this was also on 25 May so even with the pullbacks this is still looking absolutely fine. Duke energy this was long calls on",

Yeah I kind of like this oh yeah that's the other thing I wanted to do so I wanted to update one of these labels this one I want to update this so that I can look at the percentage of time for the window looked at that there's risk premium so update this script haven't chatted UPT to it update this script so in the VRP label at the end it includes a count of handles where there is positive VRP then express as a price which should be xx cent and then positive over negative.
