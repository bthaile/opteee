    "text": "may so again what i did was i just fought fast forward time before i did the video to look for a period where selling short calls started to look attractive that turned out to be 9 may again you'll see the chart reflect that in just a second as soon as it updates all right so the chart is taking an eternity to update this is kind of one of the plagues of doing think back or on demand that's okay because we can see where it's currently trading at which is 117. so what i did was is actually evaluated some short call options and i think let's see what i actually went with for both of them i went with the 30 junes so what i did was is i went out 52 days and then again our basis right now would be giving us a dollar in change so i went out two dollars to get 58 cents now i know what you're saying you said you're saying eric you could have gotten 50 cents before why didn't you do it but you're doing it now it's because i'm giving the stock appreciation room so when it was trading at 50 cents before it was at our basis we would make zero dollars on the stock in this scenario we're going to be able to collect 50 something bucks but then also we have two dollars of capital gain space for the stock so that's exactly",
