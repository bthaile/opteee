    "text": "What's up, Alias? I got this comment on a GameStop video talking about a position that I've shared with you all and completely transparent about. So as soon as they said, hey, GameStop is down a bit, can you talk about what the current position is and how I manage again? Answers absolutely. Now, for the context here, the video that they're referring to is about a coverage triangle in GameStop, you can check out the last version here. I think there's a third version, as a first version as well. And I can throw the links in the notes below, just like you could see what it was, what it's starting at. But you can see that the allocation that the trade was given was 25 grand originally. This was based on what the community effectively wanted to see. I have a GameStop position in the my personal portfolio that this is just a scaled down ratio version of to fit the $25,000 allocation. So I just apply multipliers to all of it to make it look relevant. Now, the only big change is on that 25 grand. I've changed the allocation specifically. It's now at 50 grand. And the reason why I'm doing that is because I already showed a little bit about a 25 grand position, so I doubled it now to 50. And we'll talk about what this all is in a minute. Now, let's talk about what GameStop has been doing. And if we go",

Now, let's talk about what GameStop has been doing. And if we go back to where we started the year, which is right here, we started the year around 31, which is pretty high. And this is as it was really back a little bit and going through this repricing that you saw it. Actually ended up hitting a low of like 273 after which it started rallying back up. We had a little bit of a blow off peak in the mid 30s, cratered after a decent earnings. It traded effectively completely sideways for a couple months. But another soft rally into the high 20s and has now been punished way back down below. And the main thing from a technical perspective here that's interesting is I actually really thought the floor at like 22 hand was going to be a bit stronger. Now the line that you see here at 255, that's nothing new. I've had that drawn for a while. And all I'm doing is using this longer time frame. So where it was balancing out here and balancing out here, realistically there's another kind of smaller one down here at the 18 handlers.

So when I'm thinking about what I expect game stop to do, it does seem like it's in a zone where it's very likely to consolidate unless there's some sort of bad piece of news to send it down lower. And we can see it's most recent earnings was actually pretty well received. There's also been a lot of corporate activity going on over these time frames, which does absolutely add movement pressure to the underlying. The main thing is that if a trader had bought game stop at the beginning of the year and just held that position, you're down pretty bad right now. You would have gotten at 31 and now it's at 21. That's a pretty profound move. So really cool thing about the strategy that I use in game stop is it effectively allows me to capture all of the really unique qualities of game stop that make it what it is. So if I think about the qualities, there's really high IV implied volatility for options traders. This is super important even for stock traders because things that have higher implied volatility per centile, it just means that they move a lot, not necessarily one direction or another, but any direction.

Now even though for those that trade options, you might see game stop right now with an implied volatility per centile of 17% which is relatively low as a gross number 70% vol is still quite high. So what that tells you is that game stop itself is a very volatile name. Why is this so important because or short premium strategies that can be lucrative? It's not just vol being high in general, but it's more importantly the relationship of IV to RV, which is realized of all. This is what's known as variance risk premium. In general, there's pretty strong variance risk premiums and game stop. So I can show you a display of that here. Don't worry about all the other stuff on this chart. The main thing I want you to focus on is the purple line. If the purple line is purple, it means that there's variance risk premium at the 30 days to expiration window. When it's red, it means that there's not. It means it inverted that the realized move is bigger than implied. The main takeaway that you should pay attention to on this graph is that for the last year, most of the time, the line's purple and not red. That",

That means that they're typically speaking is variance risk premiums. That can be very lucrative and I'll show you some details on that. The other thing is if we think about other profit mechanisms within game stop, the other is the squeeze potential. This is always lurking. Now I do think that the squeeze potential has come down just because there's a lot of inventory available. It's not as hard to borrow. You actually don't even see labeled as hard to borrow anymore, which typically it is. That decreases the overall conditions for a squeeze. It doesn't mean that it's impossible for it to squeeze. It's just decrease conditions. The way that I look to capture this kind of profit mechanism is through long equity. Then potentially long calls. The reason why I favor long equity though is for liquidity, because as something is having a true squeeze, not like this kind of move where it's just doubling and change, which is still a big move, but that doesn't really fit the bucket here. When something is going parabolic, let's say it's up at 80, liquidity in the options chain goes right out the window. It's because volatility skyrockets, which means",

When something is going parabolic, let's say it's up at 80, liquidity in the options chain goes right out the window. It's because volatility skyrockets, which means that the bid aspect spread, if you think about the bid aspect spread, maybe typically it's this far wide, it becomes this far wide. And much more difficult to get a reasonable fill on your trade. Because all of that, this itself is doable, but very difficult to execute, which is why typically favor the equity side of the position. Why do I trade what's called a covered strangle? Because it broadly is optimal. If we look at the individual components or the legs of a covered strangle, we have long equity, right at it, so it's not confusing. We have long equity, which is base position. Then there's short cash secured puts and then short ratio covered calls. The reason why this is such a powerful combination specifically in something like GameStop is because normally speaking with normal names, the puts trade at a premium to the calls. This is known as putsq. This is in a deep options lesson, just stuff free to be aware of. In stuff like GameStop that can have these parabolic upmoves, these calls actually trade very rich.

Makes it very profitable. Now there's some more nuance on how I traded around squeeze specifically, but for those that don't know, the reason why I started a covered strangle in GameStop is really more at a solidarity with the ape community. I still consider myself a guest and you guys have been very gracious with me. And I established this position a while ago for two reasons. One literally just to show solidarity and maintain a position in GameStop with you all. Obviously doing what I have to do is a trader because that's what I do is I trade or my income. So I need to make money on stuff. Why does that matter? Well, because if I just bought here and held, I've not made any money really this year at all.

I'll give you some summary level details and then we'll go a little bit more in detail. Don't worry about all the noise on the spreadsheet. I'll explain all of it in a few minutes. But the super high level summary really comes from this section. Now again, the overall percent returns on the portfolio are not going to be as good because originally this was based on $25,000 from when I started this exercise, which the exercise was started what in December of 24 it looks like when I started like this specific piece of it. So because of that, this is going to skew down because the majority of it wasn't 50 grand allocation, it had less. But that's okay.

You should just keep that in a context like the actual return numbers would be a little bit higher. So the realized PNL on the position from when I started is up $3,700. The return on capital is 7.41% that means this realized gain against the total allocation. And then there's a total PNL which includes realized and unreliased, right now relative to the entire allocation, that's 9.8%. Again, this isn't anything that's smashing, but this is where stuff is kind of important. Because if you look at what the underlying was trading at when I started, it was trading at 29. So the underlying from when I started is down 26%. Yet I am up. I'm outperforming the underlying from when I started by almost 40%. That's what matters. And that's what makes this such a powerful tool. And I'll show you what the position sits at today. I'm currently long 600 shares at a basis of 2290. The options position right now, I have two tranches. One that was entered 27 October, one on the 4th of November, both are in the 19th desexperation, both are at the 22 strike. Why?

The purpose for this is, again, I'm slowly moving myself away from being buried in the money. I added a little bit of size to do this, going from a five-lot to a six-lot, which represents 600 shares now. The total share equivalent of this is 1100 shares at a strike price of 22. Now these, I do not intend to take a Simon on at this point, so I will continue to adjust these as needed. But right now they're doing fine making money. Now the main point I was explaining earlier is how the returns on these can be pretty good. If you look at the returns for both of these positions, it's about 6% and then 8.5%. Again you will lie, that's 42 and 69% returns. On the call side, which is typically very cheap, that's still giving me a 4.4% return for something over 45 days, and the return annualized is 35%.

A thing that's super important to note is that the short call lag you'll notice is at a ratio. So what that means is I have 600 shares. I have at least 200 shares right now that are uncovered, if there was some sort of massive overnight gap that I wasn't able to buy spot price as things were moving, which is obviously exceedingly unlikely. But this is just conservative in case there is some sort of massive parabolic up move, because the other thing that I do is I trade in and out of my shares. And it's for the reason that I explained earlier, if a trader instead just bought on the first and did nothing, or I guess the second of January, and did nothing, you're down, like pretty good. Where is if you bought here and you dollar cost averaged in as it was going down, then as it rallied up and had this really awesome peak above 34, and then you exited as it was coming down, you realize again on your shares there.

Well, you're going to generate taxes and stuff like that that you have to pay attention to because capital gains tax can be annoying, but you only pay it on money that you make. So the way that I'm trading game stop right now is the same as I've been the entire year. I literally run the coverage triangle, and that's my base position. Now with respect to the more cool stuff, which is looking for unusual options activity and things like that, I could do a separate video on that if you're interested, but the main version of that is that there just hasn't been that much going on. I actually was doing pretty regular updates on game stop and I slowed down on those just because things got quiet, but also if that's something that you guys are interested in, I'm more than happy to find some sort of cadence and produce those again.
