I gotta say, the humor in this is so unbelievably massive because right before we started this, I literally, I literally said the dastardly words to Newton. I said, this one should be good. I like, I like went through everything to make sure that this was seamless to get onto. And now this was probably the latest livestream I've ever started. So thanks everybody for hanging in there with us. And Richard, great to see you again. Thanks for hanging out. Likewise, it's always fun to talk. Let me mute this other video here. I'm just pulling up the chat. What's up? What's going on, everybody? It looks like we have the gang in the house. And yeah, sorry about that, everybody. I typically try to make this a little more smooth getting launched, but I, you know, it got me, it got me good. So we know what it is for next time. That's what I'll leave it at. All right, so a couple of things we have to talk about. I figure we can start really quick with any new Pokemon cards that you want to share with us, any new polls that we like. Oh, you know what, I didn't come ready for that, but I, I did get this box here. I'll show you guys. Got a box of Paldae evolves from GameStop. This is it. It looked like emojis. It kind of do. So",

This is it. It looked like emojis. It kind of do. So my idea was, you know, there's no way I'm going to collect all the Pokemon that's literally impossible. That's why I limited it to Pikachu's and EV's. How many are there now? Like a thousand. Oh, yeah. And then, but I wanted to collect a elite trainer box from each box in the current life. Like rotation, which is Scarlet and Violet. So we're working on that kind of fun. Yeah, that's awesome. So when you're opening these with your daughter, does she have a preference for like all graphics, non holographics, like what kind of stuff does she like to see in the cards? I know that you said that you guys both like EV, but is there anything beyond that? She's really looking for like a secret rare, a double secret rare. I don't know all the rarities, you know, but like a V or a V star or something really exciting. So she'll come running up to have we got a good one today because typically the thing is is around six or seven we play and then post playing then we can open one pack. Got it. Okay. So that's like, that's a big event. Yeah.",

Well, a little bit of old Max Payne, eh? Did you make of the glorious clothes on Friday? You know, having experiences for so many years, this is why I said the May 3rd cycle was so important. The cycle hit on a Friday that never happens, right? So the eternity that goes from a Wednesday into a Friday or from even a Thursday into a Friday is enough time for the stock to get back to Max Payne. So I think that's why we saw everything we saw. If you go back to May 3rd, stock ran up like crazy that day on 36 million volume and that was a Friday that never happens. So we saw action happen on a Wednesday and then the duration between Wednesday and Friday all the way back to Max Payne. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

It's the movement this past week was really interesting and I actually made a standalone video about Max Payne because as you know from our conversations, I approach most things as a skeptic, right? I want to make sure that there's data and I want to make sure that there's some sort of support for the thesis and for especially for what we saw on Friday. That is now there's one specific thing I'm looking for. What I saw on Friday is very interesting to start with in terms of how price moved and where it landed, very interesting. And when I say interesting, that's me kindly saying I think there was very clear manipulation. That's what I think. It's in a complete opinion. Actually. There we go. I had to go run and go grab my hat. But I definitely think that there was manipulation on Friday. Now that I got the hat on, I can speak plainly.

Bell people become a little more familiar with the topic because it still stands for something like Max Payne. You can't move something super far. It's like the market makers just they don't have that leeway with their book. But something where Max Payne's at 25 and it ends at 24.97. Can they move it three cents? Yeah, bully. Absolutely. You don't believe they can move it three dollars. It's 10s, three dollars. If it's at 30 bucks for them to move, it's a 10 move. Now I wouldn't put it outside the realm of possibility, especially if it lines up really well. But I also don't personally think it's quite as simple as people maybe think it is because they're fighting order flow. So for example, if Max Payne is down at 25 or whatever and it's up at 30. For them to move it down the, you know, in that case, five bucks. So maybe we'll do 27. In that case for them to move it down three bucks, they need specific market conditions to allow them to",

In that case for them to move it down three bucks, they need specific market conditions to allow them to be able to do that. Because for example, if there's a lot of people buying options, there's not an opportunity for them to essentially move things south. They would have to be buying shares in order to hedge the positions that are coming in. So it creates a natural conflict for their ability to move price down that far. Now if we're talking about a scenario kind of like this past week where there's broad weakness, there's a lot of selling. The options, chains are slowing down a lot towards the end of the week. Could they move it more than three cents? Yeah, I absolutely think so. To what degree can they move it? I genuinely don't know the answer to that. It wouldn't put it, like I wouldn't put it past that 10 move in a lower flow product like this. That's not, that's not crazy. Like if somebody said, I think they moved it three bucks, I wouldn't be like, there's no way, not at all. Now if somebody says, well, we were up at 35 and they put it down to 25, then I would probably say in my opinion, there's probably more forces at play",

Now if somebody says, well, we were up at 35 and they put it down to 25, then I would probably say in my opinion, there's probably more forces at play than just that. Could it still be a contributing factor in that kind of scenario? I think so. But would it be the dominant move for something moving, you know, again, from 35 down to 25, probably not? I agree with what you're saying in a sense because we've seen historic Adobe days where days or weeks where games stop just tracks the spine. Right? The spine moves up on a wave formation, 1, 2, GameStop does 3, 4, 5 in the exact same wave formation or kind of downward as well. So we've long seen that correlation. So with a broad market sell off like we saw over the last three days, GameStop just like, it was interesting though. The first day GameStop didn't move it strongly. I would say as buy or the VTI told market index, but then it was day two that like GameStop went down with like 8, broader market sold off and GameStop went down like hard, right? So but I don't know. I'm going to diverge from your opinion though. I'm going to say I think they have much more control over overflow because they can route off exchange. Right away, if you're",

Right away, if you're routing any buys off exchange and it's just all downward pressure, then you could sink this thing really fast. It's going to cost them right in the long term. They're going to go to they're going to be internalizing and have to buy back later. So could we see upwards move next week, right? From them having to pick up shares like maybe they paid the piper, they paid the piper next week to save some money on premium this week or make some money on premium I suppose. And then they can use ETFs right? So I know I think ETFs is huge behind all things. So there was huge creation and redemption of ETFs going on all week. And the last couple of weeks. So I feel like that gives them a lot of capacity in the short term. But I'm going to feel like the price. Yeah, I agree with you.

I might my guess is you might know. So maybe naively kind of just but from one stock. But from but from your observations, you're picking up like really interesting factors that are absolutely there. So I actually fully agree with that that sentiment. I think the the part that we probably just diverge in is likely the impact of incoming order flows impact on the ability to do so because even the scenario that you outline there, I actually still fully agree with you provided that there's not some sort of counter order flow that slows them down.

And I'm kind of creating a data set that lets me look at when we start to have larger daily returns, what are the corresponding conditions around it in terms of some other indicators that I tend to look at? But from a statistics perspective, which I'm always happy to share with people because whenever I try to talk to my dog about it, he doesn't listen. And there's massive clustering that happens at periods of times. And that's interesting, the fact that it clusters like this. So this is something that's very much in its infancy, but there are some really interesting trends that I find here, even these random offshoots that are popping up like this. So I don't know if that's something that you've spent a lot of time looking at. I know that a big focus is on the big moves, obviously. But part of me is curious about the frequency and the severity of the smaller, quote unquote, big moves, because these are still big moves relative to the periods. Do those are those like part of your tracking process? Are you mostly looking for the really big? Yeah, and I was thinking I was trying to think of even a better way to do it because I've got the gaps or indicated on there. But maybe looking at something like previous day, close to the next day's higher low, something like that, because I want to, because you've seen",

I just want to look at something really cool. I'm actually in the process of downloading the extended hours data for you, because I have it. Oh, that'd be great. Yeah. On that chart, it's kind of showing a lot of activity happening. Do you want to pull that other one up again that when you had on, hang on. Yeah, sorry. You're good.

They were released in 2006. And the company's just kind of going bang gangbusters has its best year in 2010. So it's on like an uprun going into that. So coming off of like a pretty decent low. And then so really every console cycle is a big deal for GameStop. So you can see like right in the middle there, like right in the middle there. The next console cycle is 2013. So you're going to probably see some pickup and volatility between 2013 to 2015 as they realize those are next big batch of good years because their cash flow picks up so substantially with the consoles. And then it's just the next console cycle was 2020. So cash flow again picks up again. So it's very cyclical long, long. How has it behaved with the console cycles moving forward? Is it still just people are buying it through the store? And then, um, and then like they go pick it up. I'm curious if like with the people just buying consoles directly from wherever the manufacturer's and shipping it to them. Is",

We're seeing hardware is a growing portion of their cattle or their sales. It's up to 57. Would you guess that? It just keeps going up hardware just keeps going up year after year after year. Let me go back historically so you can see just how low it really was back in the day. And hardware, hardware was only eight. Hardware was only 18 back in the day. So even as low as 15. So to go all the way up to 57, um, they're selling the consoles themselves, but a lot of peripherals. I think there's like peripherals now for consoles in their ever worse. So controllers, sensors, um, cords, all kinds of stuff. And why what's the like what's the driving function there? Why do people procure it that way as compared to, you know, just going and grabbing it from Amazon or something else? I don't know what does chat think about that? Like, um, I don't own a console.

Um, by my trot. No, that was self unrefurbishing trying to figure out what it was that they picked up. But their whole thing where they're refurbishing because they do a lot of inhouse refurbishing. Like this mouse I'm using is a refurbished mouse from GameStop. So they never did that in the past. So you can go into GameStop and you can get a lot of stuff that's like cheap computer peripherals, um, and system peripherals. So I don't know what the draw is to go to GameStop. Maybe it's just close by so people just go, they need a controller. They don't want to wait. Just drive over to GameStop, pick it up. It's sick. I love this. I mean, it's way up though. 15 for hardware and accessories. 15 to 57 over a decade is crazy. Game sales are way down. Game sales were like 60 and they're down to 27. Interesting. So that was that was roaring kiddies. These are number one, by the way, it was with a console cycle approaching. What he typically saw in their balance sheets was cash flow positivity for several several years off of the console cycle.

    "text": "number one, by the way, it was with a console cycle approaching. What he typically saw in their balance sheets was cash flow positivity for several several years off of the console cycle. And then so he was like, yeah, it's in a real low right now, but they could pay off all their, their senior notes right away by getting all this cash from selling all this hardware, which is exactly what they did. They can repaid all the senior notes through the end of 2020 and early 21 really helped out their balance sheet. The share offerings obviously helped a lot too. So we've got another console cycle coming up here in probably, I think the next Nintendo switch is coming out next year. And then follow pieces. What's up? Are those like big releases? The Nintendo switch. So the we was not that great. We was not that great, but the switch did really well for I'd say for everybody, especially the game stuff. But because Nintendo is big on physical game sales as opposed to the other ones, they do digital downloads too. But I think the switch was just a long lasting, very successful system. I think switch to is going to be highly anticipated. The Wii U flopped because I think the name wasn't well understood, but it was a whole successor system. So people will be like, I love my switch. I want the switch to I think it could do really well.",

So rather than sinking up with the other side with the other consoles, the other consoles will be a while. So I think it could be a big release, honestly. And then the next PlayStation and Xbox will probably be 2027. So we're two or three years out, which is kind of like exactly where roaring kitty bot in like 18 months out from the console cycles. So we're early compared to when he bought in. Got it. So something to think about though with three upcoming over the next couple of years here consoles, that's the cash flow for game stop. Got it. And there's a question from recent chat. They're saying, do you think our case shares have been delivered yet? I think that they've been delivered by the market maker through ETFs. I think now the authorized participants are in a period where they're going to create some units of whatever their ETF is. I WM you mentioned maybe VTI. And they're going to look for an opportunity to pick up some shares. I think we might have seen a bit of that over the last with those sandworm kind of lips.",

It's just longer than people think because as soon as one participant passes it to another, they get a little bit more time. Got it. I think they could even push it again too. Like if they go out and put if APs go up in large demand by orders on the market, other APs could swoop it up.

And it's kind of like what I'm doing with with GameStop, at least part of the shares. Is it's just to be involved and try to show some solidarity for the movement. But anyways, the options is completely different. I'm trading in and out of these things. I'm trying to make money here. So going all the way back to the MoAS concept. Where do people come up with their ideas of like what that number is? And how do people expect to behave around it? Because there's a lot of people that go through like these really big rides. And then they come back down, go through another ride, come back down, that kind of thing. Right.

And then kind of frustration to I think a lot of it is like they deserve to pay. They cheated. So, looking at it realistically. In 21, they turned off the buy button because they said this is going to destroy potentially a significant part of the financial system. So where would they let. Where would they let it go before that kind of thing happen again? Would you guess? I think it seems like the probability of it getting up to a thousand based on what happened previously is low based on what they've done. Yeah. So that's I think they.

No problem. Something to think about my brother has this concept of like relative market cap. So what's the market cap of the biggest company right now in the world? It's like in video or. I think it is. So one of those two are Saudi or Amco right so it's like three it's like 3.5 trail right. I think that they're like at four. Let me see. I'm curious. So remember that. Yeah, yeah. When this whole thing started when game stopped started three years ago it was like 1.5 or two. So these companies are growing and getting huge. So let's say it's 3.5 trail right. Divide that out by a game stops outstanding shares. If games stop where to become the biggest company by market cap briefly in the market like like Volkswagen did with a squeeze. You're looking at 8,000 dollars a share 8,215 dollars a share. So that would be like the brief peak right where those top trades would come in because the idea is.

    "text": "think about now like. Going to going to Wednesday right. Imagine a lot of short interest probably piled in on game stop puts and shorts hitting it hard at 29 when they saw it start to falter and waiver. You know and then they just now they made a quick 16 on the trade trading it to the downside. So it doesn't have to be people paper handing or selling it could just be big sell action. Right right. Yeah kind of trading both sides. Yeah one of the one of the other questions that I saw come through. I think this is from someone esoteric was their name and they're saying do you think that roaring kitty is potentially trying to build like a like essentially a case like evidence. That there's some sort of corruption or collusion going on in the back end do you think he's working that angle at all or do you think he's kind of just focusing on trading what he can see. I think that I mean he was put under incredible scrutiny for yeah a household trader granted he was YouTube and he was meaming he was doing a lot I mean you really was he had a reddit account. Twitter account he was sitting it from three angles making the best trades ever and doing entertaining content. But to drag him into Congress and blame him when his YouTube channel his livestreams have less people on them we have on now",

Yeah his his early ones were were pretty light also shout out to you guys by the way. And so you know he got investigated and his previous employer got fine right mass mutual. And I think if he's building a case I don't know that the case is about market manipulation and games not specifically but definitely about protecting his his self himself right which is he revealed his position and then just held it through crazy volatility could have been work 900 million dollars did a livestream stock on hammer off of his lives. And he's proving that everything he's doing affects the stock negatively you know he's not doing a pump and dump and in fact I would you know if throughout it he just keeps increasing his share count he's not dumping on anybody. So I would say I don't know that he's building a case to go after manipulation the the SEC and finner and so forth have got to do something though because it just seems like there's too much going on here. I mean it's even getting the attention of people like John Stewart I think he did like a piece on",

I did one or two I think he might be doing a follow up. Yeah because I did a video basically touching on what I think are the key points I think he's right you're the one that I forgot I forgot anything that I know about GameStop I probably learned from you I was trying to think I was like where the hell did I hear this from but that must have been it. But that's the other things I feel like as it gets enough attention for stuff like that part of me again going super tin foil hat. It does make me curious though when I see like for example in Congress right now they're just getting to the point where they're all crooked look like I like ridiculous. They're just now getting to the point where they're trying to move a bill that stops them from trading individual stocks it's like the most common sense shit on earth.

Well, I think your question that you're asking me just want to make sure you play around it is like. Would there be a reason for this to be taking as long as it is right because basically there's this steady build up of attention on it by the public by John Stewart people keep contacting their representatives contacting computer share the company could be you know pursuing litigation in the background we don't know. And I think that short selling in general is getting a lot of attention so I think that could be the case. I don't know Congress seems to move quickly sometimes like they move very quickly in 2021 that very much surprised me I said that a lot because they don't move quickly on anything right to get ahead of the story kind of shut it down get it off the public radar but then here we are it's it's happening again so.

I don't know i'm i'm never very optimistic about politics because like you said it's such a. A common sense thing to do is political representatives that have access to committee information which is going to be incredibly impactful I think about like for example just a really easy one like solar policy right how much that could move markets in the solar industry in just a whim or anything dealing with like automobile manufacturing or. I don't know chip anything to do with chips right or health care or anything like that you have the access or energy policy anything going on in those committees is going to move markets and the fact that they don't have trading restrictions put on them is just completely absurd so. Because they're all becoming millionaires there are there the number of millionaires in congress on both sides of the aisle is way over the per capita number of percent of millionaires in the background in America and that's troubling right it's just i mean i say this in my to my friends all time it's just like what happened in Rome right so in Rome the senators all became these all the parks incredibly",

And I don't want to see that happen to the United States of America so we got to put restrictions on. I couldn't agree with you more than that oh we got somebody that chatted and I'd rather be seeing what a great name and they're happy with the tin fall hat i'm glad yeah i feel like you guys can't see it but there's actually pebbles in it too that make like the little thing around the the crown so. You know i would never equate myself to to Jesus the whole crown of Thor Thorne's doesn't seem come but this is not super comfortable either so but i have to give myself a shout out because this doesn't breathe at all i mean at least for the thorns you get to vent right vents that must feel a little bit a little bit of a break out here.

That's you know these these dates right there's the the bloomberg terminal guy and we talked a little bit about that it's that stuff i. From a trading perspective i know that that's honestly silly like there's nothing that you can see on a bloomberg terminal that is magical that's not already disseminated into the market right so. They were apparently looking at swap data and maybe misinterpreted in the swap data because as you know from data the trades going to come in and then that swap can be modified repeatedly and right so that's the reason why i haven't dug into the swap data it's just painful styles of inventories and there's it's like the same traits modified modified modified so getting any eyes on what when those are due and then it could come to do day and they could they could probably roll it or do whatever with it. So it's like you don't even know what the impact is going to have on the stock either.

To make it a little more digestible to speaking of breathable top. To make it more digestible to get through but yeah I agree the other problem with swap data too is that you can always make new ones like as long as you have somebody that's willing to be a counterparty you can only happen 24 hours a day to that market never sleeps so. We don't know and it's a little bit vague to in the in the data on on what the position actually may entail. It could be it could be a swap that's not based it cannot be a total return spot right it could be basket it could be a volatility swap so they're just betting on it staying in a channel breaking out of a channel moving up to some degree down to some degree it's just an enormous data set to dig into.

Yeah I think that makes a lot of sense but going back to the origin of that thought is what did you make of the up acts the past week. Well I thought something you said was really interesting was you said the community sets itself for this date hope you think this is a three year story though we've been hyping dates forever and people get mad and then they want more dates and then so people start suggesting possible dates and but that date actually did some stuff like you said. The price moved up to Wednesday the date for unknown reasons hit a high of 29 90 or whatever that's a 20 mover whatever in two weeks that's that's a good date I would actually say it didn't move to whatever price target they had said but they were probably one of the better trust me bros we've had in recent times so but as far as the op X goes then you know hit that relative.

Yeah so I'll share my screen with you I can't prepare this time that's good it's honestly our faces have been centered on this too long anyways don't like that can you see. Sure can. So what I'm really looking forward to is June option settlement was right here on the 21st and it was a big one because not only is it a monthly standard option settlement right but Roar and kitty had purchased his 20s for that date and it just created a ton of interest more interest on GameStop in terms of options than we've seen in years.

In case you didn't know the chat is enamored by your cross air. Yes they appreciate both its size and its girth. So so we had big options quarterly settlement and this is also going to because this is a quarterly this means that there was huge creation redemption this is obvious in the flow on ETFs on that same period not related to GameStop but just related to ETFs probably washing capital gains so huge and so we had a lot of money on the other stocks on the 21st so if you go six trading days forward that would take you to July 1st. So conceivably what happened was a market maker went to an authorized participant and said on July 1st or somewhere around here hey we need a lot of games stop they then failed the creation of a whole bunch of units of either XRT or other ETFs and then now they've got 35 days to settle. They lead us into August so I've got the 35 days indicated there in red. Those are calendar days and then the trading day happens because they go out and they're going to go buy",

Boom here's our infamous day June 6th that I was personally looking forward to because we hadn't had one of these ETFs settlement cycles in a long time but we did see one on May 3rd which came off of March options in the same exact way back here. So we've now seen two of them we saw March the May we saw April lead just lead to June. Will we see June lead to August so that's what I'm that's what I'm looking at.

We saw the creation redemption activity go on so especially because it's a quarterly like I said every quarter they wash their capital gains i'm not looking at that very closely and August August is pretty consistent so June usually hits like 67 of the time. July like never hits but August hits pretty often like 50 of time so you know could be could be people will remember in 2022 August 8th was when GameStop and BBBY ultimate to like 50 bucks or GameStop into 50 I forget what BBBY went up to but they ran in tandem because they were in the basket together the basket tends to move in correspondence on these events so you can just look back at the basket. But basket so but we had a drought of these for a year for a year somehow they were able to defer and like after UBS took over credit Swiss we didn't see any of this stuff happen since June of 2023 and now we've had.

May and June and just feels like a season for ETF settlement to me I don't know so that's that's what i'm really helpful for we didn't get our July well we'd say we saw something happened here right little baby cycle. Now yeah that's actually another question I had for you is how would you classify the move. What happened on July. Yeah because I know that that's that's part of your tracking is to kind of. There were some there were some things that tell me it was a forced settlement event because. The biggest part of the move was in the pre market. It went up to 29 98 or whatever in the pre market it was doing that fluttering characteristic like forced buying kind of like. I mean it was balanced on like a lot like 50 cents at a time boom boom boom boom it was like it didn't care it just needed the shares so this tells me that like some number of trading. So it was getting forced through CNS for some reason and then we just saw it. Characteristically just plummet like boom hard to climb right and to me it's always with these look like look at look at June 6. They did not care about the price after hours was going crazy",

They did not care about the price after hours was going crazy and it just drops off a cliff into the morning especially with the 8k saying that there be a share offering same thing with May third actually. And I'm crazy didn't care the problem was there was a floor of options here they had been built up and notice how it landed on a Friday so uncharacteristic right. This one's happening on a 6th this one's potentially happening on a Thursday. Give some time to get it back closer to Max Payne they did not have that capacity here in the landed way above like 5 above Max Payne on May 3rd. So I think the reason that I think the reason that happened was because why did that happen this April's a 30 day month. It's a little bit shorter. I'm not sure why it ended up landing on a Friday that time just worked out that way super fortuitous I think I think that was very impactful. And when you look out into August. It seems like yeah how do you think about the date that you're specifically looking at against the op-x does that matter to you at all. Well I think that's it's better because like",

For August 9th right now right tiny the ninth is very small so the ninth has 15,000 calls against 5,000 puts the what I find actually kind of interesting those 16 aug has 171k calls against 97 puts that's not topical really what I find interesting about that though is that that's higher than the 26 July which is at 126,000 to 54,000. It doesn't surprise me in terms of a standard up x versus a weekly but just the front expiration cycle has been so heavy in game stop typically yeah we thought last time you said yeah the 19th was very heavy compared to August 16th yes and now but now the 16th is out weighing the 26th exactly exactly correct.

Our op x we just had right so you go six trading days out you go 35 ever to go map on my sheet yourself just pull the sheet. It would be like the day of earnings. Did you say the I have it or so I have the cycle coming in the next day so that could be that could be exciting right we're doing cycles here and. Because typically they want to slam the price down part and so the earnings call occurs in the after hours on Wednesday they tank the price no matter what. It's like a very rarely moves positively on an art install for game stop but then if it's hook off like a rocket the next day. That would just be like kind of fun and September cycles aren't unheard of there when you pulled the noise said I have to go and then i'm just hanging out.

What the move was for sure exactly what the magnitude was I think that would be very very cool to see overlaid on this because then you almost I mean and. Like I said i'm really good at assigning people work via ideas I've got all sorts of ideas but the other thing I think would be cool to see here is like a well you can kind of visually see it but like a moving average to see yeah but. The definitely go in seasons though yeah seasonal that's in but i'm just so confused for the July that's that's one of the December makes sense I understand why that might have more seasonality based on holidays and deferrals that one I get July confuses me I still don't feel like I understand why this one is.

I love that so xrt was going through like a bit of a creation cycle and then redemption just happened and price got tanked right so i'm building a model for this but. What stands out right away is every quarter on op x you can see huge creation and redemption happening across all the ETFs like it the magnitude way scans out so it's on March. And then it's on June op x as well. Right up here. And these are like huge huge creation and redemption events and they typically are the same amount created over a couple days and then redeemed over a couple days and what that would be is capital gains washing on the ETFs because they're basically trying to make us so someone does is sells an ETF. They get preferential capital gains treatment and especially the associated. What's it called what's mutual fund with that ETF that they share the same pool with so what i'm looking at now is on these cycles. So they do that in June right.",

So here's game stop. And I've got a little bit of a potential tailwind event. I've got to indicate it right on here. It's got the. I put green here. I think volume will be big. On that day, okay. On the 8th. And the next day, just like we saw on the 6th. Right. It be derived from the events here of June. We did see characteristics fails to deliver on xrt. Not a lot on the other ETFs. There's nothing really going on here except for OpEx. They're roaring kitty, it bought in six days prior. So it's T plus six office trade. That matters. Volume's not crazy, even though it's a very big OpEx, 28 million, not the most exciting volume for that period. And then we go to the flows. So let's look at the flows on 621 per...

Because to me, one of the things I would find curious about this is if the availability of something like GameStop is limited, it seems like going through this process would be really painful for them. Exactly. That speaks right to this paper by Evans, we were talking about earlier before we happened to call. And he's talking about when the ETFs are more liquid-weight than the underlying, which is happening with small caps a lot. And that's exactly the problem with GameStop. Look at the flows here, sorry, the back to the data. The flows on these things is crazy. You're talking about eight million shares of VTI. Well, how much GameStop do they need? Right?

And ETFs were only 10 of the market capitalization, but there were 20 of the short interest and 78 of the fails to deliver. So they're failing the underlying to create these units. Right. So what I'm going to talk about is, I love the paper. It's so good is they basically talk about, so if there's a big order imbalance, like someone comes in and buys a huge number of shares, well, then you go to an AP, you request the shares, the creation of the shares of the ETF, that's going to then dry up the volume that's hitting the market. That's going to suppress price in the short term. So the ETF makers could actually get a better deal on the underlying because all of a sudden the price dips. I think we could be seeing exactly that.

Gotta go play some Pokemon. Yeah, it's time for you to get out of here. Thank you for hanging out and walking me through a bunch of this stuff. I would love to catch up with you again. Again, I'll shoot you a text, we can coordinate, but I'd love to catch up with you again next weekend or whatever. Yeah, let's play it by ear and see when a good day works out. I don't know if I'm available next weekend, but... Perfect. Yeah, very enjoyable. I always learn a ton. Thank you so much for having me. Yeah, man, it's always a good time. Thank you, everybody, for coming to hang out. And I think for a while, we're over 400 people, chilling. So thank you guys also for being a part of the whole story. I feel like a lot of the community is what makes a lot of this so interesting on top of everything else going on. So I'm super appreciative of everybody being a part of it and at least letting me observe and learn. So thank you, guys. Richard, you're the man. Thank you for chilling for a bit. Everybody else, thank you for hanging out. We will keep you up to speed on what we're doing. Our next one, we're",
