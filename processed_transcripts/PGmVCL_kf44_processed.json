    "text": "A bit of a hectic market today. I want to talk through a couple of broader concepts on what I saw going on today to share with you all. And then I want to take a look specifically at a handful of questions I got on GameStop. As I'm always happy to look and share what I can see with you all. So what happened today? A couple things. The major thing I noticed was this broad rotation in movement of capital because if we take a look across the primary indices, the SPX literally gaped down. That's not crazy, but it's not common. If you go back through this chart and you look for periods where this is over the last six months where it actually gaped down like this, it's not super frequent that it makes those kinds of movements. The SPX spy, whichever you want to use, it tends to be a little slower than that. So we were at a just crazy high level. I wouldn't start freaking out when you see something come off a high and go into a consolidation. That's a very normal behavior. I feel like sometimes people get so used to things kind of going this parabolic up that we forget that there are other directions. So that's one thing I saw. The other thing I saw was when I look across technology using the NASDAQ as a proxy, it took way more of the front. And that's probably because tech",

The other thing I saw was when I look across technology using the NASDAQ as a proxy, it took way more of the front. And that's probably because tech has been so focused on for so long that this is no surprise to me. Everything within tech essentially needs to exceed extremely high expectations. So this also looks like something that probably needs to consolidate in base for a little while in order to shake out the weekends, getting some new money and to base appropriately for a solid foundation. To me, it doesn't look like, okay, tech is falling off a cliff and everybody that has exposure to tech has screwed, nothing like that. But this does look like it is entering a consolidation period. This is not an insignificant gap down. I flattened out my teachable cues position today because it ran through a bunch of my zones. And then the other thing I want to show is the Russell because it is showing relative strength. So everything else gaped down today. This did not. It's partly because in my opinion, the Russell is playing catch up. It has been so lazy on the year compared to everything else until we started getting a change of rate cut environment, things like that, which sent it up and off into the moon to catch up.

So that's why in my opinion, we're not necessarily seeing the kind of rotation across here. All right. So that's enough from a broad market perspective. I really want to talk about some of these GME updates because there's some interesting things going on with a down date today. Crazy, right? So right now, GameStop closed down 1.96 and after hours, it's trading around 2760. So about another 40, 30, 40 cents lower than where it sits right now. This also looks normal to me. It's not surprising to me at all to see GameStop come down today when the broad market was down. That's not to say GameStop. GameStop couldn't go up because it can when the whole market's down because I always endeavor to remind everybody this, it behaves differently. What I mean by that is say, for example, you're looking at another sector. Let's say you're looking at the financial sector and you're looking at stuff like Wells Fargo, City Group, you're looking at Bank of America, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley. If you look at that basket of stocks off of them, let's say financials are going down writ large. The probability of one of them being up when the",

If you look at that basket of stocks off of them, let's say financials are going down writ large. The probability of one of them being up when the rest of the basket is down is not impossible, but it's pretty low. That's not common at all. It's the same thing for GameStop. A rising tide lifts all boats and if we have a waning tide, it tends to pull things down in mass. So there were segments of strength today, but they were confined. It was not strong across the board by any means, obviously. So to see GameStop come down a little bit today, to me seems completely normal. It's been on an up move, essentially from the first of July. It's just been moving up. The other thing I want to highlight, if we move in closer is that if you look at the SP 500, it gapped down. If you look at GameStop, it didn't gap down. It's essentially just an inside candle here relative to the previous day. So on a relative basis, this is actually showing strength, which is hilarious because how often would you consider finding strength in GameStop compared to the SP 500, which today technically it was? The other thing I notice here is the volume. We still have higher than average volume over the past two weeks. Most of",

The other thing I notice here is the volume. We still have higher than average volume over the past two weeks. Most of it was sale volume, but price didn't really crater that much. That's telling to me because there was definitely selling pressure today, but GameStop didn't capitulate to it and it's kind of hanging out here. So this doesn't look bad to me at all. This looks like it might be consolidating a little bit, which again, it's completely normal for products to go through these consolidation phases. It's important for them to do that. So there's that. And I know that there was a lot of excitement today. A couple of people were asking me about the thesis. I guess there was some dude on Reddit somewhere that was referencing access to like a Bloomberg terminal is some sort of like Oracle of information and that today was supposed to be a big day.

They're not necessarily the arbiter of truth or some sort of forcing function that's really unique to that scenario. It's not never the case, but it's rarely the case. Especially if it's something like GameStop, the longer I look at this, the more I find, there's tons of people trying to make guesses about when we're going to see some sort of big move because it's fun, right? But the problem with that is you can come across a lot of really convincing arguments that just don't pan out because the market doesn't care. The market doesn't care how good a hypothesis is. To see these kinds of moves, you need very specific conditions to emerge. And sometimes they're very difficult to pick up on ahead of time. I definitely didn't top tick any of these. I didn't get into this at 10 and I would add 6483. It's super difficult to do that kind of stuff. So what I would recommend to people is the digestion of information is good.

And they're asking if they should buy super far out of the money, short term calls for this week, predicated on that information. Would you probably already know my response to that? I chuckle because it's hilarious. I think like what a difficult way to make money in this business long term doing something like that is so low probability. But I always go back to you got to do what's right for you. But what I would encourage people to do is be receptive to information, always be skeptical, healthy skeptical, meaning requiring a certain level of validation. So for example, Bloomberg terminals are really cool. I've messed with them for a long time. There's a lot of great data in there. There's nothing magical in there. There's no secret edge that's baked into a Bloomberg terminal. There's literally thousands of people that are on there every day looking for them. So for example, I know that they were referencing swaps. You can see the swaps. So we know that they're there. It's not this insanely impactful insider information that nobody knows.

I would love to see people taking a slightly more pragmatic approach to this to hopefully see some success in this long term because you do get moves in GameStop. GameStop does move. That's one",

I would love to see people taking a slightly more pragmatic approach to this to hopefully see some success in this long term because you do get moves in GameStop. GameStop does move. That's one of the cool things about it. It even moves now. Some people are not missing or fully appreciating the fact and are missing the fact that from the first of July until yesterday is up like 20. That's in like two weeks. That's a that's still a respectable move. That's not insignificant. So all of that to summarize is just be thoughtful. Pay attention to what makes sense for you. Digest information, but always be careful about overweating data from other people and be careful to fall too quickly online with appeals to authority that can mislead your decision cycle. I think that's where I would leave that. So let's take a look now at the options. We did see a big trade come through. We have 3,000 of the 26 July 30 calls. These came in closer to the bid. So the market was 226 by 235. So it's a little closer to the bid side, which would infer likely a sale. My guess is these are some sort of covered calls. That's my best guess here. And this looks interesting to me, but it's nothing to write home about because it's one. Now if we start seeing more",

But it's a little early to decipher too much other than the fact that this is something to be aware of. That's the way I look at that kind of thing. Looking out at total volume today, it was very high. 312,000 calls against 67,000 puts. Very heavy call volume going on here. The vast majority of it still is right in here at the 30s. 19 July 24 30s are on fire. They're so active. Hey, I saw a couple of those today. So oh yeah, I forgot to update you guys.

It's anomalous in general compared to normal products, I should say. But for this so far, it's not crazy. We see the puts going off the shelf as they always do. This is very normal. And this doesn't surprise me. It's grossly outrunning the calls though. When we were seeing a lot more of that bullish vol skew to the calls, the calls literally were outpacing the puts. But that's not what we're seeing now. So the market is not heavily pricing in vol on the call side. It is pricing in vol heavily on the put side. So the last thing I want to talk about was another question I got about these spreads. So people were talking about, hey, there was a bunch of puts that traded yesterday. And there was. But these were seemingly part of spreads. So that matters because it exhibits a little bit less conviction than had they been single trades. The whole point of trading verticals is to decrease the sensitivity of the position. And the positions that I saw got put on were really interesting. It looked like a mix of 40s, 45s and 50s.

And then I can see 15 of the 45 puts came through at the bid at the same exact time at the same exact size. That again, tells me that these two are overwhelmingly likely tied to one another.

It wants the underlying to go up, but it needs to move in order for them to really start making money. The positive to this is it does have downside risk protection. There's a lot of things you can read into with a position like this. It's very interesting to me because it's not the purest expression of an idea. It's a sizable trade.

You don't trade something at this size by happenstance, by just slinging something. So there's an idea here, but we just can't really fully look into it. I just wanted to make sure everybody knows though that this isn't some sort of massive buying or selling of options. It's actually both. It's a vertical spread. So that's that. All right, you guys. So we have a couple days left into expiration and we are eagerly waiting to see what's going on here. Overall, it looks like the options positioning is standard, I would say. Meaning I'm not seeing a bunch of super crazy volatility, but I'm also not seeing any. I'm not seeing crazy skew just yet. So this looks like a little bit of a let's see how it goes scenarios.
