I want to spend time going through a lot more of that DD library that we took a peek at a little bit last time that I had no idea what was the thing, but super stoked that it is. So we're going to poke through there and hopefully learn some more about GameStop, the stock, the background, the story, all of that great stuff. I was actually just texting with Peruvian Bull. So he and I, we're going to create some more content together in a little bit, actually pretty stoked. He's starting to build out and might get a little bit more into live streaming and stuff, which would be really, really cool. I like learning about his perspectives and what not. So what's up, apes? Great to see everybody. Also great to see the outliers and the outlier apes. Really, whatever you consider yourself is cool here. We don't really care. Everybody is welcome. Let me grab a few reddits. We need to grab GameStop. We need to grab Superstunk. I think those are the main ones, right? For GameStop reddits, is that correct? I think so. Yeah. And we got to grab the, we got to grab our map as well. You already know that. Cool. So I think we literally have everything we're ready to grow. First things",

There was somebody on one of the other live streams that was a little salty that I spend time in the beginning of the live streams, which kind of bullshitting and doing this map thing. But I told them that I actually don't really give a fuck about their opinion. And I have fun looking at the map with you guys. One of the really cool things about this for me, at least, is how crazy is it that there is an individual stock that connects people like this? I don't know of many other stocks that do this. Sure. You could say something like Apple or Amazon, but it's different, right? Like people that are buying Apple or Amazon, they're not buying it because we just love Apple as a company.

You're trying to tell me California. I'm trying to tell you based on your name. I'm not buying it. I'm not fucking buying it. Maybe we're in, let's go.

So may he can boy, wherein may he can may he call or are you from originally? We got Maui, I don't know if we have Maui on the list already. I think we have Hawaii. Yes. So we have Honolulu.

And they feed the names to other people because we have it set up that unless you're verified, you can't see everybody else, which is kind of part of how I set up the partitioning system.

And whatever reason in the actual fight, it looked like he couldn't even like really walk, which I couldn't figure that out. Because they're obviously they're not going through like some big dehydration rehydration thing. I like I yeah, I just I couldn't identify why that was happening the way that it was. It didn't make sense to me. And obviously training clips are always going to be really carefully selected and what not. But it literally looked like he like couldn't walk well, which I that part I don't really understand. The other thing that I thought was really interesting is that he just didn't throw much which that's why is this Mike Tyson fans are saying she stole the show. Oh, I see. Yeah. What the fuck is this Mike Tyson to Jake Paul in the third round. Oh, yeah, that's funny. It's fun. That's so funny. Yeah, anyways, I I didn't think that he he looked. I don't think that he looked that bad. I think people people had some crazy as expectations for a dude that's almost 60. But I did expect",

So I think for sure it was just him at least I didn't see anything like there was nothing wrong with the mouthpiece from what I saw went in went out just fine. It was nice and tight as it should have been because his coach had a hard time plucking it out a few times. But yeah, that it just I've seen him do it a bunch throughout his career. It's like this fucking tick he does. I think it was revved up to like 11 though because he probably felt a bit uncomfortable, right?

But yeah, the you could tell even the way when when Mike did connect with Jake compared to when Jake was connecting with Mike, Mike was just getting kind of like pushed as a whole unit. But the handful of punches that Mike landed like you could literally see Jake's head moving, right? There's a difference in power that Jake doesn't have compared even to 58 year old Mike Tyson. There's a power difference that you can see it. You literally can see it in a sturdiness difference. So that's like says he did it for the money. I think he knew he wasn't going to have this.

And the only time he's been able to get out of the whole fight thing is by heavily drugging himself. He's either highest fuck or on a bunch of fucking shrooms to chill the fuck out, which is good.

And you can tell because anytime Jake started getting near Tyson, Jake just backed out, which is super smart because the fact is, again, even 50 or eight year old Mike, man, if he connects well, like you're fucking sleeping, there are people who have the gift of power and there are people who do not. Jake Paul doesn't really have the gift of power like that. You can tell just by the way he connects with people. Somebody like Francis and Gano from the UFC does Alex Pereira from the UFC does. And the way you can tell that power differential from people is when we have somebody that has to catch you perfectly in order to knock you out or TKO you, that's mostly precision timing speed applied really well.

That's what countermer Gregor has precision timing speed. He has that stuff down perfectly to connect. But then there are people like, for instance, Gano when he knocked out Alistair over him who's no slouch. Alistair over him is a tough mother fucking dude. And you I'll show you the punch. He like he literally connected on like his fucking neck. And he still had more than enough power to put him out. That's the nature of heavy weights. As soon as you're above you know 220 you have generally the gift to enough power to put somebody to sleep decisively. I'm really interested to see steep A versus John Jones. I don't think it boats well for steep A because he's been so inactive. But we'll see how that goes. What was it going to look up in Gano over him. And then we'll get into Jimmy. Yeah, this this year. I have to kill the sound. Otherwise you guys know we'll get we'll get like copyright struck. But take a look at take a look at this. So I think they do it in slow motion afterwards. But just watch where he connects like again, you can tell the difference between somebody who has power, the gift of power and somebody who doesn't. So the knockout right there super fast can't really tell. But",

It very likely will look a lot different than what this one historically looked like, which I'm not sure if that's being fully accounted for here by people. But again, the answers up to you short sellers likely needed every share to cover the position. A lot of me says they mean it hasn't happened yet. Okay. So that was the following. So I see. Okay. So Lauren says it wasn't a squeeze. It was a sneeze in my last days tomorrow. Okay. So then the prevailing hypothesis is that what happened in 21 was a smaller version of what's expected to come. Is that correct? Not a true squeeze until synthetics are forced to cover. Well, is that I don't understand that definition? Okay. So Jan 21 was a sneeze.

Yeah, no, I get that, but I still the part that I'm not understanding here is if we're expecting a bigger squeeze in the future and the last squeeze was cut short because of the total impact it might have had on the financial system.

They weren't like the movement that you saw in Tesla was like pretty textbook short squeeze like older school if we're talking like mid 20s slash. I think there was also what in 2020. I want to say that there was another instance of a squeeze there as well. So, but Tesla to me would be an example of just like standard squeeze falls off rolls up. So, said, Drake says it wasn't Mellaz because they had time to exit the shorts. Yeah, well, and that's kind of the nature, right? Of short squeezes because they happen. And that's why it's called a short squeeze. And again, like a short squeeze is different than a gamma squeeze, which is really important to differentiate between them. Because a short squeeze still typically reconciles and it's not being fueled inherently by market maker. Sean says this is the debate, I think. Some people believe in the fairy tales of one million per share, but I think most people regularly just think something akin to Tesla. But so then so then Sean, in that example, then most people you would by that position, you would say like most regular people aren't then gunning for Mellaz. Most",

Thomas Petrifi said it would Mellaz. Yeah, definitely. Petrifi talked about the total systemic risk, which was no joke there. Sean says yes, but it sustained highs. I don't that's the part I don't understand because by its nature, a squeeze, whether it's a short squeeze or gamma squeeze is temporary. Squeezes don't persist into perpetuity. It's a it's a functional constraint that exists. Lawrence says can a short squeeze turn into gamma squeeze or vice versa? Definitely. So short squeezes and gamma squeezes absolutely have interplay, no doubt. And the interplay can literally be violent between short squeezes and gamma squeezes. So what 100 100 happened? I'm going to stretch this and then I think I can even zoom in a little bit for us. I see. Okay. So that's man, that's like tricky to get my arms around. So let me let me know if I got this right.

And then I have a secondary question, which is if we're holding, where's the where's the exit that isn't stepping on one another to get out the door? Because the only way to realize the money from a squeeze is to sell at some point. And then as that selling starts to occur and cascades into future selling, that pushes price down. Of Vladimir says, D. R. S. works against a short squeeze. You want higher short interest. I don't. I don't see that the same. I see your point, but one of the one of the important parts, specifically about like a really aggressive short or gamma squeeze is share availability. So if you're making it impossible for people to tap shares to move around, it decreases total liquidity. Sean says, I think some people hold this stock as a form of protest almost. Yeah.

But more importantly than that, it requires less short interest to have the same short interest ratio because there's less availability. Again, there's there's a relationship there. So.

I think it looks like people are looking at this in a negative connotation of manipulating the market as a negative connotation, which I understand now. Cedric says you ain't going to lock up millions of apes. It's not about that. It's not about that at all. You can try to find the worst offenders, so to speak. And go after them if they were so inclined. Sean says market manipulation is illegal. Yes. Well, let's actually look up the definition. I'm curious. Research the definition of market manipulation, because I'm looking at market manipulation in the, not in a legal sense here. I'm looking at it in a practical sense, right? Like the idea of trying to cause a squeeze is manipulating the market from again, like a practical sense, because it's creating conditions that are favorable for a otherwise generally unnatural market movement to occur. So it's manufactured that kind of thing. I don't, the way that I'm laying that out is not in any way trying to paint it as a bad context. I don't think that's bad. I actually think it's fucking smart. It's like, it's other people manipulate, like institutions manipulate that everybody manipulate the market as much as they possibly can. So I don't think it's a bad thing. I just think from a, from a technical perspective, it's exactly what it is. Now I understand from",

Well, I think it's because this trial was moved out by a year and he naturally isn't going to talk about it because it literally is just detrimental for him to talk about it. It raises his risk considerably. So if for somebody that's going through litigation, they're, they're just going to shut the fuck up as they should if they're smart.

Because again like even though Keith isn't telling anybody directly to do anything, there is a known. It's kind of like if I'm driving a car and I hit somebody and they die. Hopefully it doesn't happen. But in that scenario I could just say well I didn't know that they were going to die when I hit them. Maybe I hit them going really slow but maybe when they fall they hit their head and then die. The point I'm making and this is a very loose example to draw the correlation though is that there's a reality that when we're in Kitty posts, we can generally assume GameStop is going to go up. Generally assume. Now I think what is clear from his perspective though is it's not like he's unwinding every time the move happens. So as long as like he's still shooting straight, keeping it real then I see absolutely nothing wrong with what he's doing at all.

Ben says if you were him, would you retire the Twitter handles and other social media stuff? No fuck no. I absolutely would not. Because again I don't think he's doing anything wrong. I think the one thing I would continue to do is like here's another reality. When he disappears for prolonged periods and then pops back up randomly, that sends GameStop reeling. If he was even remotely consistent with his posting, then the market would essentially have no effect. There would be realistically no effect because a lot of times when he bounces and then comes back people then go into a fervor about it. So yeah, I don't think you should retire anything. I don't think he's I don't think he's doing anything illegal at all. Like I said, I'm not saying that I'm just saying that the conversation is reasonable. I'm not saying I don't agree with it whatsoever. I think that there's absolutely rightfully so. There's no grounds at all to accuse him of anything which is exactly why they haven't. There's a reason why they've tried to investigate him. And I know that he was investigated in a state. But again, investigation is different than being tried or accused. Those are slightly different things. So yeah, I don't think he's doing anything wrong whatsoever. I think he's literally just a",

I can have and I do have opinions, but the opinion is in a separate bucket than the analysis. The analysis is what it is. And remaining as objective as humanly possible, I think is super important. We're all riddled with bias, but it's easy. So this is super interesting though. All right. So we got through the market manipulation component and there's this. All right. So I think we can get through this. How are these crazy high share prices that people say possible? This is cool. No one knows how high the squeeze could take the stock price. The best rational reason says that these numbers are possible through the laws of supply and demand. Furthermore, it's likely that a short percentage is a lot higher than reported.

See, this is interesting. This is interesting because this is a incomplete analysis, right? Realistically speaking, the reason why it's an incomplete analysis is because they're talking about the underlying function that could lead it, lead to it, which is completely fair, but this misses, this is like a theoretical perspective. It's not a practical perspective. And the reason why that matters again is the impact to the broad market still has to be considered, which is essentially exactly what happened. So then what is your short squeeze? We know this. Let's see. Basically, a bunch of institutions think a stock will fail, pile in, more often than not, they do not make a lot of money. Go and notice short squeeze can occur. Yep, that's, that's all fine. More than 100, we know that because that's straight fucking trash. Why games stop? Here we go. Short squeeze can happen anywhere. There is short interest. Game stop, however, is special case. Short sellers got extra greedy. They were sure that Game Stop was going to die. So sure, in fact, they began selling naked short, the stock like crazy. The other thing to know about this kind of thing is part of seller boxing, which I don't necessarily think is fully what got into place here. I think they were probably going down",

The other thing to know about this kind of thing is part of seller boxing, which I don't necessarily think is fully what got into place here. I think they were probably going down that path. But the really interesting thing here from my perspective is that there's a massive tax benefit. So if I'm shorting something that ends up going bankrupt, I literally get a tax benefit on the position as it's closed, which is huge. When you're talking in the millions and millions of dollars, the tax benefit itself can save you quite literally millions of fucking dollars. So this is incredible to me. And this is a really great point for them to call out. Naked shorting, I think we already know what they is. Who's Ryan Cohen? Yep. Chairman of Game Stop. I think we know. Clearly believes in Game Stop to the point. Well, the other thing to know about Ryan Cohen from what I've seen is that he absolutely is a bit of an activist investor, right? He he's talked about this before and he from what I've researched, he has a pension for looking for stuff like this and trying to intervene. So I also think that he just embodies the approach of an activist investor, not quite a Bill Ackman because Bill Ackman and Warren Buffett have a slightly different approach, I think, but very similar",

One of the many things that hedge funds have tried to do to curb stomp retail investors is flooding our public communities with reddit accounts. Purposely spreading some negative sentiment. Now, okay, that's what I was going to ask the proof. These accounts have been seen all over not just reddit, but also YouTube Twitter, not just conventional social media. Anywhere you could talk about GME, the term shell is a blanket term for those accounts, them, bots are people. Do we have do we have evidence of this? Like is there a thing that links to like negative comment and perceived bot account? I'm super, super interested in that.

Because even somebody that's at a place like BlackRock or Citadel, they're massive. They have massive influence, but they still are not able to fully control the something like the bond market. Linzo says, I don't know if you went over to this. The point of deresting the shares is to get a total kind of shares owned by retail. This way we could say we own the whole float.

I don't think that this is a massive one for us to read unless you guys do because like it. It isn't there's nothing in here that I would openly debate. I am sure that different kinds of institutions like that are committing securities fraud. And I don't think that it actually impacts that much. So yeah. The reason why I say it doesn't impact much is just because until there's enforcement, it doesn't really, it doesn't really move the needle. Okay. I think this is one of the ones that you guys said that we had to read, right? A house of cards. Am I, am I remembering correctly? I think you guys were saying that this was a big one.

In 03, several issuers with DTC wanted to remove their securities from DTC's deposit because the DTC persistence were naked short so on their securities turns out they were right. Okay. The DTC and its participants have created a market-sized naked short scaling scheme. Okay. This is very interesting. So I'm going to drop this in first. We'll read through this one specifically, but I just want to drop it in for a summary to start. Right. Let's grab Gpt somewhere. WTTC says I don't think 100 DRS will ever happen. I mean, again, I don't like speaking in absolutes. So could it theoretically occur? It could. Is it in any sense of probability going to occur? No. The reason why the the answer is exceedingly unlikely is because there are people, there are institutions that already have the shares. So as long as those institutions maintain the shares, then there's no way to achieve 100 DRS. So it would require institutions choosing to unwind their shares for whatever position, whatever reason. And I'm sure some of them would over time. But it's it's like you can't buy something that somebody isn't selling. Um, Impulsive says only need to DRS float, not outstanding. Okay.

Recently, a number of issuer securities have independently requested that DTC with draw from the deposits, sort of securities by them. As explained in further detail by many, the commenters opposing DTC's proposal, the issuers have made these requirements alleged that their securities have been target of manipulative short sellers. That's nuts. Dear Senator Lieberman, my firm represents FST shares traded on the NASD OTC, Bolton board. We're writing to enlist your support of our request to the SEC to conduct an investigation in negative short selling of shares of small cap companies on the OTCB. That's awesome. That's absolutely awesome. The rules should not be passed because by permitting the settlement of so-called shares by traders not holding shares certificates, DTC itself to be incompetent to uphold the law and stop. That's awesome. So there's a lot of people coming out unhappy with them. That's red. Ultimately, migrate to T plus one. All that stuff's already updated.
