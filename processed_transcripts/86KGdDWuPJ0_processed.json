I want to spend time going through a lot more of that DD library that we took a peek at a little bit last time that I had no idea what was the thing, but super stoked that it is. So we're going to poke through there and hopefully learn some more about GameStop, the stock, the background, the story, all of that great stuff. I was actually just texting with Peruvian Bull. So he and I, we're going to create some more content together in a little bit, actually pretty stoked. He's starting to build out and might get a little bit more into live streaming and stuff, which would be really, really cool. I like learning about his perspectives and what not. So what's up, apes? Great to see everybody. Also great to see the outliers and the outlier apes. Really, whatever you consider yourself is cool here. We don't really care. Everybody is welcome. Let me grab a few reddits. We need to grab GameStop. We need to grab Superstunk. I think those are the main ones, right? For GameStop reddits, is that correct? I think so. Yeah. And we got to grab the, we got to grab our map as well. You already know that. Cool. So I think we literally have everything we're ready to grow. First things",

So we, our map is filling out. There was somebody on one of the other live streams that was a little salty that I spend time in the beginning of the live streams, which kind of bullshitting and doing this map thing. But I told them that I actually don't really give a fuck about their opinion. And I have fun looking at the map with you guys. One of the really cool things about this for me at least is how crazy is it that there is an individual stock that connects people like this. I don't know of many other stocks that do this. Sure. You could say something like Apple or Amazon, but it's different, right? Like people that are buying Apple or Amazon, they're not buying it because oh, we just love Apple as a company. It's, no, we think Apple is revolutionizing technology and growing, which is one of the neatest things about it, I think.

And I emphasize this stream because it's not like I have a big YouTube channel or anything. So the fact that there's this many people from all these different places from this smaller corner of the world, I think is really cool. Mahi Kenbois from California, Mahi Kenbois, don't you lie to me. That name's pretty clear where you're from. I'm just saying. Like I was born at night, but it wasn't last night. You're trying to tell me California. I'm trying to tell you based on your name. I'm not buying it. I'm not fucking buying it. Maybe we're in, let's go. So if you're in California, you're probably somewhere super far south or LA based on your name. And my guess is, well, let's see, we have to get a fact check here. So Mahi Kenboi, wherein Mahi Ken, Mahi Koh, are you from originally? We got Maui, I don't know if we have Maui on the list already. I think we have Hawaii. Yes, so we have Honolulu. We need to add Maui. That's a cool ad. And then I guess one time I have to, I have to stream one",

So she went to like school and stuff and Kauai. So I mean, that's pretty close. I would give her credit for it. Mahi Kenboi says Monterey County. Oh, I see. I see. All right. Khalid Nali says actually someone named outlier asked me about that on Discord, but is this part of something else? But I wasn't sure if it was a bot. No, it wasn't. So for anybody ever that, for those that don't know, there is a free part to the Discord. And then there's the part for the Patreon people, but the Discord is free, literally for everybody to join. But I want to emphasize a specific element of it, which is this.

What they do is they leave people in the Discord so that the person in the Discord isn't the one that's actively reaching out. And they feed the names to other people because we have it set up that unless you're verified, you can't see everybody else, which is kind of part of how I set up the partitioning system. So yeah, the punchline is don't get, just don't get scammed. That would be, that would be great. And I say that because I started doing the whole YouTube thing and building the community and all this stuff to help people. And it's just super frustrating to me that some people are getting ripped off by some bots straight piss me off. So, a college says, got you a dude had your link. Oh, yeah, they copy everything. Yeah. So what they do is they literally copy the entire profile to make it, obviously, look like it's me. That's their goal.

Because they're obviously they're not going through like some big dehydration, rehydration thing. I like, I, yeah, I just, I couldn't identify why that was happening, the way that it was. It didn't make sense to me. And obviously, training clips are always going to be really carefully selected and whatnot. But it literally looked like he, he like couldn't walk well, which I, that part I don't really understand. The other thing that I thought was really interesting is that he just didn't grow much, which that's, why is this Mike Tyson? Fans are saying she stole the show. Oh, I see. What the fuck is this? Mike Tyson to Jake Paul in the third round. Oh, from, yeah, that's funny. This fuck that's so funny. Yeah. Anyways, I, I didn't think that he looked, I don't think that he looked that bad. I think people, people had some crazy expectations for a dude that's almost 60. But I did expect him to be able to walk a little bit like that, that really did surprise me. The fact that he couldn't",

Yeah. So that fight, I didn't catch all of it because we went for a walk during it. And it looked, I mean, it looked like they, they had a war, though, from the clips that I saw before he left and whatnot. So yeah, that, that I'm stoked was a, was a good fight. It looked like the one girl had a cut above the eyebrow, which always sucks. Like getting, I don't know, getting cuts like that, especially from it accidental headbutt, just sucks, because it puts a different tenor and it changes the fight a lot. But I mean, it is what it is, right? It's the fight game shit happens. Colleagues is totally, his legs were throwing me off. What was you doing with the chewing his glove or mouthpiece? It wasn't the, it wasn't the mouthpiece. If you watch again, like I'm, I'm a bit of a, a fight dude. So if you watch my Tyson's old fights, he has a tick where he bites his glove.

So I think for sure it was just, him, at least I didn't see anything like there was nothing wrong with the mouthpiece from what I saw went in went out just fine. It was nice and tight as it should have been because his coach had a hard time plucking it out a few times. But yeah, that it just, I've seen him do it a bunch throughout his career. It's like this fucking tick he does. I think it was revved up to like 11 though, because he probably felt a bit uncomfortable, right? Like, because you can see when he tried to bounce around and get his feet on the room for whatever reason. Like he couldn't, he like it didn't look comfortable at all, which is again, it's so, I just, I'm really, really confused by it to be completely honest because like he didn't look bad when he was sparring.

Again, if you don't have legs getting knocked down, it's entirely realistic. And he didn't do that to him, which I actually thought was classy. I thought that that was cool. So yeah, overall, overall interesting. The main thing is I'm fucking stoked that he got through it. All right, that he's healthy. He looks completely fine. He came in in shape.

But the handful of punches that Mike landed like you could literally see Jake's head moving, right? There's a difference in power that Jake doesn't have compared even to 58 year old Mike Tyson. There's a power difference that you can see it. You literally can see it in a sturdiness difference. So that's like says he did it for the money. I think he knew he wasn't going to have this. I think so too. I think for sure that obviously if if it wasn't what like a 20 million fight, I think that changes things. But even then, I don't think Mike needed the 20 million who doesn't want 20 million. I'm sure it doesn't hurt. So I actually don't think money was the only motivating factor.

And you can tell because anytime Jake started getting near Tyson, Jake just backed out, which is super smart because the fact is, again, even 50 year old Mike, man, if he connects well, like you're fucking sleeping, there are people who have the gift of power. And there are people who do not. Jake Paul doesn't really have the gift of power like that. You can tell just by the way he connects with people. Somebody like Francis and Gano from the UFC does Alex Pereira from the UFC does. And the way you can tell that power differential from people is when we have somebody that has to catch you perfectly in order to knock you out or TKO you, that's mostly precision timing speed applied really well. That's like a Conor McGregor. That's what Conor McGregor has precision timing speed. He has that stuff down perfectly to connect. But then there are people like, for instance, in Gano when he knocked out Alistair Overheim, who's no slouch, Alistair Overheim is a tough mother fucking dude. And you, I'll show you the punch. He like, he literally connected on like",

He like, he literally connected on like his fucking neck. And he still had more than enough power to put him out. That's the nature of heavyweights. As soon as you're above, you know, 220, you have generally the gift to enough power to put somebody to sleep decisively. I'm really interested to see steep A versus John Jones. I don't think it bodes well for steep A because he's been so inactive. But we'll see how that goes. What was it going to look up in Gano Overheim? And then we'll get into Jimmy. Yeah, this this year. I have to kill the sound otherwise you guys know we'll get we'll get like copyright struck. But take a look at take a look at this. So I think they do it in slow motion afterwards, but just watch where he connects. Like again, you can tell the difference between somebody who has power, the gift of power, and somebody who doesn't. So the knockout right there, super fast can't really tell. But watch watch when they bring it into slow motion. So watch where watch where Francis is left hand lands watch.

That is a massive blow debilitating off centering stuff like that. But there was so much power generated from this dude because he has that gift that if you watch his head, his head snapping back is what knocked him out. It wasn't this hit up front, which is crazy. Most people know for like knocking people out, the big thing is to cause massive disruption in the brain, right? It's like whiplash. That's what will cause it. So if you take a look at the way his head flows, that that's what knocks him out because he has the force.

Is that correct? Not a true squeeze until synthetics are forced to cover. Well, is that I don't understand that definition. Okay, so Jan 21 was a sneeze.

It says, yeah, basically the believe that short hedge funds figured out a way to hide short positions and swaps and never close. I think that's true. Like I've seen evidence of that for sure.

I don't know how to keep rhyming that. But if that squeeze was considered a sneeze. That was halted, right? There was direct intervention by market forces to stop it. What's the premise then that the next squeeze would actually be a squeeze versus being halted again by market forces. Renegade trader says wishful thinking. I'm in pressure. But I think SM I think time and pressure doesn't matter, right? Because if we look at the previous instance, there was obviously enough time and pressure that would have propelled price much higher. But then there was an artificial intervention. So the way that the only way that I could conceivably see an argument being posed by somebody that would be logical would be that they think. Conditions are different that would lead to markets not intervening. But I don't I don't see why we would think that that would be the case because we know from the original sneeze that the market was literally concerned like about composite total market viability.

So I don't see why anybody would think that we would be less inclined as an institution again taking the other side's perspective less inclined as an institution to stop in occurrence of that again, I don't get that. I'm just getting caught up Vladimir says who was buying 480 per share on 27 Jan 21 crazy it's crazy, but again, if you're going into this thing not knowing that it's about to be intervened with a squeeze like that literally can double again. So even for somebody that gets in at 480 that doesn't mean that you can't get out for a fucking thousand. So the people that would be doing that are the people who are a bit late to the party, but they're doing the trading game of buying high looking to sell higher. I don't hate them at all. The people that the people that bought it 480 they got fucked because of a rug pole because the market then decided like, no, we're not letting this go on anymore we're done here and that fucking sucks.

Yeah, no, I get that, but I still the part that I'm not understanding here is if we're expecting a bigger squeeze in the future and the last squeeze was cut short because of the total impact it might have had on the financial system. Why do we think that the future squeeze is going to be bigger than the previous squeeze that was smaller and still cut short. Like I just I'm trying to understand that as you can tell like my you know my my heart's out in the open here I'm trying to understand. Because from like a logical perspective I just don't understand how that reconciles. Sean says prolonged squeeze like Tesla that's not a squeeze though. So what Tesla has done is appreciated and value as a company they become more valuable that's completely different than a squeeze. The squeeze may not be bigger but the run may be longer I see. Okay, I see okay so then that. Sadrick says 100 Tesla is a squeeze what what moving Tesla you guys talking about I don't know actually what we're what time frame or reference what time frame we're referencing. Tesla is short",

Tesla is short inches from 2016 until they ran up okay got it so we're talking older test sorry I thought you were talking about something more recent yeah well I also think there's a couple news articles about that right.

We're not talking about this idea of like melas or anything is that correct. I'm trying to understand the context here. Micah says well GameStop is in a better position and wider base investors are choosing to buy more buying pressure along with short covering could be huge I see. I see okay so sadrick you're just saying that yeah so that that's that's why I'm confused with the comparison to Tesla.

Another instance of a squeeze there as well. So but Tesla to me would be an example of just like. Standard squeeze falls off rolls up. I said to say it wasn't my last because they had time to exit the shorts yeah well that's kind of the nature right of short squeezes because they happen and that's why it's called a short squeeze and again like a short squeeze is different than a gamma squeeze which is really important to differentiate between them. Because a short squeeze still typically reconciles and it's not being fueled inherently by market maker. Sean says this is the debate I think some people believe in the fairy tales of one million per share but I think most people regularly just think something akin to Tesla. But. So then. So then Sean in that example then most people you would by that position you would say like most regular people aren't then gunning for moass most people are just gunning for like a future short squeeze reminiscent to what game stop is already experienced is that correct.

I don't that's the part I don't understand because by its nature a squeeze whether it's a short squeeze or gamma squeeze is temporary squeezes don't persist into perpetuity. It's a it's a functional constraint that exists. Lawrence is kind of short squeeze turn into gamma squeeze or vice versa definitely they so short squeezes and gamma squeezes absolutely have interplay no doubt. And the interplay can literally be violent between short squeezes and gamma squeezes so what 100 100 and happen. I'm going to stretch this and then I think I can even zoom in a little bit for us. I see. I see. Okay. So that's man that's like tricky to get my arms around so let me let me know if I got this right there are some people.

Of Vladimir says drs works against the short squeeze you want higher short interest. I don't. I don't see that the same I see your point but one of the one of the important parts specifically about like a really aggressive short or gamma squeeze is. Share availability so if you're making it impossible for people to tap shares to move around it decreases total liquidity. I think some people hold this stock is a form of protest almost yeah I mean I already told you guys I the shares that I hold is literally just to it's literally just to support the the eight movement like I just want to show the eight some love because I think what they're doing is really interesting. Yolo rollo says drs takes shares off exchange so they can't short though yeah if you're not synthetic shorting right if you're synthetic shorting then you're still shorting but more importantly than that it requires less short interest to have the same short interest ratio because there's less availability again there's",

Yeah there's a hundred and sixteen people in here shout out to you guys thanks for helping me learn about this by the way I'm I genuinely am a appreciative okay so it looks like 25 you guys are saying is drs so of the 25 then that's drs and then we're going to get a target a target percentage that is been identified as like a critical point. we have something to edit PDF copy attacked right through on our line highlight 100 100 would be no good. I don't think that would be good at all. Why would you guys",

Oh, I watch, we watched that a bunch of times. I'm not sure if you're new to the, new to the series here full send, but yeah, we spent a while looking at that stream because it's hilarious. Certainly seem to lay it out shows you his holding shows you quite a lot of ground when the stock went down to if anything, what he's doing is now sending up the perfect defense for a market manipulation, giving regulators everything he would use in his defense if they brought up a market manipulation. Up to the other trying to do, I think ban him. Very high bar to reach ban him from ever being able to trade again. I think so. That would be the only outcome if you were charged with market manipulation seeking a lifetime ban. Try",

Receiving retail investors act very differently from how they did back in 21. Reacted to the positions you're showing and holding and affirming is holding what's the market supposed to do? How much of it is different from what day traders were back in the late 90s? Really 2000s. It's one thing to be an investor, another to be a trader. So far this looks fine. So you're seeing that regulators are looking at key kill and trying to find a rule that doesn't exist to control the market. Yeah, that looks okay. Sean says the point is why is it even a discussion? It's a fair discussion. I think it's a completely fair discussion. Again, even though Keith isn't telling anybody directly to do anything, there is a known, it's kind of like if I'm driving a car and I hit somebody and they die. Hopefully it doesn't happen. But in that scenario, I could just say, well, I didn't know that they were going to die when I hit them. Maybe I hit them going really slow, but maybe when they fall, they hit their head and then die. The point I'm making, and this is a very loose example",

The point I'm making, and this is a very loose example to draw the correlation though, is that there's a reality that when we're in Kitty posts, we can generally assume game stops going to go up, generally assume. Now, I think what is clear from his perspective though is it's not like he's unwinding every time the move happens. So as long as he's still shooting straight, keeping it real, then I see absolutely nothing wrong with what he's doing at all. Ben says, if you were him, would you retire the Twitter handles another social media stuff? No, fuck no. I absolutely would not. Because again, I don't think he's doing anything wrong. I think that the one thing I would continue to do is like, here's another reality. When he disappears for prolonged periods and then pops back up randomly, that sends game stop reeling. If he was even remotely consistent with his posting, then the market would essentially have no effect. There would be realistically no effect. Because a lot of times when he bounces and then comes back, people then go into a fervor about it. So yeah, I don't think I don't think he should retire anything.

So anyways, going back to the original question from Sean, which is what was it? This is what it was. He violated the employment agreement with mass mutual. He was trading things that he shouldn't have been trading. And mass mutual should have caught it earlier and stopped it. But they didn't. So that's why mass mutual got fucked. So yeah. WTDC, sorry, Fraser Ron because regular people were able to follow him. It got noticed. No, it's because it just got big. It didn't have anything to do with other people's involvement. It's because he literally became a fucking celebrity. So it's like the reason why they like, I wouldn't even be surprised if they didn't, if",

It had everything to do with his popularity, which is again, it's very cool. It's like really neat earned popularity. But Sean says why why wasn't he liable? That's kind of the cool part is because it's a corporate policy. So his job could have chosen to try to pursue him, but they found it easier not and they just accepted their fault because again, it's also not Keith's fault that mass mutual wasn't doing their fucking job.

How are these crazy high share prices that people say possible? This is cool. No one knows how high the squeeze could take the stock price. The best rational reasoning says that these numbers are possible through the laws of supply demand. Furthermore, it's likely that a short percentage is a lot higher than reported. See, this is interesting. This is interesting because this is a incomplete analysis, right? Realistically speaking, the reason why it's an incomplete analysis is because they're talking about the underlying function that could lead it, lead to it, which is completely fair, but this misses, this is like a theoretical perspective. It's not a practical perspective. And the reason why that matters again is the impact to the broad market still has to be considered, which is essentially exactly what happened. So then what is your short squeeze? We know this. Let's see. Basically, a bunch of institutions think a stock will fail, pile in more often than not. They do not make a lot of money.

The other thing to know about this kind of thing is part of seller boxing, which I don't necessarily think is fully what got into place here. I think they were probably going down that path. But the really interesting thing here for my perspective is that there's a massive tax benefit. So if I'm shorting something that ends up going bankrupt, I literally get a tax benefit on the position as it's closed, which is huge. When you're talking in the millions and millions of dollars, the tax benefit itself can save you quite literally millions of fucking dollars. So this is incredible to me.

Well, the other thing to know about Ryan Cohen from what I've seen is that he absolutely is a bit of an activist investor, right? He he's talked about this before and he from what I've researched, he has a pension for looking for stuff like this and trying to intervene. So I also think that he just embodies the approach of an of activist investor, not quite a Bill Ackman because Bill Ackman and Warren Buffett have a slightly different approach, I think, but very similar in terms of like what this is. So yeah, I think this is also really cool. Catalyst. Yep. Oh, here we go. And why do people keep calling me that? What is a shell? And why do people keep calling me that? Here we go.

Because this I fully agree and I think that this is absolutely also because if you think of it from a hedge funds perspective, if a hedge fund or some sort of institution has tons of money that's being threatened because people are starting to pool together and you want to try to disrupt that, then you can you can pay people cheap cheap to go on and start posting all sorts of shit. So I absolutely, absolutely would believe that they would do this. No doubt. So I'm just curious if we have if there's like a library of like actual accounts, where it's like somebody says some reckless shit and it's like an account that's brand new and the only thing they have in their profile is like two shitty comments towards game stop or something like that. Because to me, that would be clear as day, right? If you have accounts",

Oh, you can't I don't see the link in the chat. The chat scrubs links for whatever reason. I don't know why it's super annoying.

So this is good to know too, because they're identifying that there's a lot of people getting caught with strays. Short and distort time. Yep. If you have shill-based fun and how to spot it, here we go. Uh, note your potential bias. That's great. Not all fun is invalid.

Exclusively part here is a little interesting because it's very common for companies like this to specialize. So I don't know if this seems like it they think it's a bigger deal than it probably is. Palafox managers, one fund for Citadel. Yeah. Or owned by offshore investors in the Cayman Islands that also is just a tax and security shelter. So that makes sense. The reverse reprogramments are entirely re-pothecated and then they cannot pay off their own repo agreements until someone pays them first. Oh, interesting. This is interesting. All right, let's see what this is. The only issue I see with this is like the bond market is one of the biggest, most liquid markets on the world, like literally in the world. So I do struggle a little bit with the theory that they're using either sofa or the bond market as a relationship. Some arise. Because even somebody that's at a place like Black Rock or Citadel, they're massive. They have massive influence, but they still are not like able to fully control the something like the bond market.

Lino says this would expose all the synthetics in a cover synthetic shares you need to buy real shares and that would drive price up of no one sells supply and demand price goes up until they sell. Well, price doesn't go up and supply and demand until they sell inherently, right? You need more people buying because if you have a system where there's nobody buying, then price doesn't move. It's impossible for price to be bid up if nobody is buying it. So there needs to be an element of liquidity. Otherwise, there's there's no transaction. So yeah. But hold on the rest of you said the loan, they loan the same shares over and over again, multiply hundreds of millions and the FedEx, your millions and shares out in the well. Yeah, definitely. And they they abuse that system. No, no, no debate there at all. Yo, yo, yo, rollo says, but then margin calls. Wait, margin calls for what? I don't know where the margin calls for buy and for",

The point that I'm making is that if all shares are de-rest, 100 of the float is locked up. And then we've identified all of these naked shorts, but nobody is selling. If nobody is selling their shares, right? Because they're all locked up. There are no shares for anybody to buy. If there's nobody buying anything, price doesn't go up. People have to buy in order to bid price up. So I'm just saying that that would come at a, there's a, there's an impasse in that scenario. Yo, yo, yo, rollo says, what if there's one share?

I think this is one of the ones that you guys said that we had to read, right? A house of cards. Am I, am I remembering correctly? I think you guys were saying that this was a big one. The DTC has been taken over by big money. They transitioned from a manual to computerize ledger, 80s. And it played a significant role in 87 crash. In 03, several issuers with DTC wanted to remove their securities from DTC's deposit because the DTC process pins were naked short. So on their securities turns out they were right. Okay. The DTC and its participants have created a market-sized naked short scaling scheme. Okay, this is very interesting. So I'm going to drop this in first. We'll read through this one specifically, but I just want to drop it in for a summary to start. Right. Let's grab GPD. A WTTC says I don't think 100 DRS will ever happen.

I mean, again, I don't like speaking in absolutes. So could it theoretically occur? It could. Is it in any sense of probability going to occur? No. The reason why the answer is exceedingly unlikely is because there are people. There are institutions that already have the shares. So as long as those institutions maintain the shares, then there's no way to achieve 100 DRS. So it would require institutions choosing to unwind their shares for whatever position, whatever reason. And I'm sure some of them would over time. But it's like you can't buy something that somebody isn't selling. Impulsive says only need to DRS float, not outstanding. Okay, because again, that's different. And I agree with you. I think looking at something like float outstanding is a difference scenario. And I think focusing on that is absolutely achievable in a theoretical and a practical sense. It's difficult to do, but achievable. But yeah, I was just responding to the comment of like 100 DRS. Okay. So we know this stuff from DTC have been accused of facilitating large scale naked short selling where the shares are sold without being barred or delivered highlighted in 03 when multiple issuers sought to withdraw their securities from the DTC, suspecting the participants were naked shorting their stocks.

Seed and co a DTC and Roli holds the master's certificate of shares when shares are deposited, they issue IOUs instead of moving the actual certificates, centralizing control and potentially enabling the re-ipotentation of shares for future transactions. Okay. Oh, three issuers petition DTC tell them to withdraw their securities due to concerns over participants shorting the stocks, which could harm the value. Right. DTC proposed SR that rule effectively blocked issuers from retrieving their securities, leaving a widespread concern. Historical records and finra reports indicate consistent violations by DTC participants such as failing to report short sale transactions accurately over reporting short interest. Okay. DTC structures allows participants, primarily large institutions, significant control over deposited securities, potentially enabling market manipulation agreed. Yeah. So this is obviously highlighting the seeding codes really lack of transparency in their approach in the fucking IOU system. So back, back, all, sections. Yeah, that's fucking, that's madness. Fact, fact, fact, fact. Yeah. Yeah. Document cases short sale violations involving market major institutions. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Interesting. All right. So let's scan through this now.

I have to scan through kind of quick though, because my dinner's getting here right now. Yep. So we already went through all this stuff. Many analysts blame these computer trading large institutions. Yes. So this is just talking about the impact of computerized trading and algorithms. Yeah. Computers, dictated more and more features. Be sold, buyers, those features, insist to shut up a little prices. Oh, interesting. Risk appetite. Yep. Yep. So they wanted to pull their shares out, which we know. Bigger deal when word got around that the proposed rule changed. Interesting. Recently, a number of issue or securities have independently requested that DTC with draw from the deposits, sort of securities by them. As explained in further detail by many, the commenters opposing DTC's proposal, the issuers have made these requirements alleged that their securities have been target of manipulative short sellers. That's nuts. Dear Senator Lieberman, my firm represents FST shares traded on the NASD OTC, Bolton board.

That's absolutely awesome. The rules should not be passed because by permitting the settlement of so-called shares by traders not holding share certificates, DTC itself to be incompetent to uphold the law and stop. That's awesome. So there's a lot of people coming out unhappy with them. That's red. Ultimately, migrate to T plus one. All that stuff's already updated. So, I mean, this obviously highlights a massive loss and trust of DTC. That's massively, massively, massively impacted here. And this also really launched a lot of the conversation around naked shorting, which is huge. Like, absolutely, absolutely critical. This is awesome. How's the cards part two? I need to bookmark this one. The fuck do I bookmark? Right click. Nope, don't want to crop. Nope. I just want to bookmark. How do you bookmark? Damn. Well, anyways, I will fucking figure out how to bookmark this thing. There it is. Oh, I see. So it's already, it's already flagged. I see. Yeah. So let me highlight this. And we'll pick up from here.
