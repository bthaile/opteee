    "text": "what's up to the Apes a humble welcome to the outlier trading Channel today as promised I'm going to take a look at GameStop I had a couple questions asking just to look into recent price performance and whatnot the last time I did a video on this was this weekend so it's about time just to touch base on things as you know I've been doing videos every day however it's been a little bit quiet in here so I'm not doing GameStop every single day I'm kind of looking through the markets and trying to share different things I'm looking at but today will be about GameStop so quick admin note tomorrow I'm doing a live stream at 1700 Pacific time with Peruvian bowl and we're going to look at GameStop together so there's actually a lot of GameStop content planned for this week because then we also still have getting through the rest of roaring Kitty trades I think this is part five of analyzing all of his old trades so we should hopefully wrap that up this weekend and continue moving through the the rest of the back story on this thing so I am eager to see where we go from here and then if there's anything that you want me to take a look at with Peruvian bull just let me know happy to integrate as much content from you guys as I possibly can so that we're talking about the stuff that you're",
