    "text": "How can you logically size your options trades? This video is designed to dive directly into that topic and to cover three main topics. Why you should care about this, the process that I use, and then some best practices at the end for you to consider, because like most things trading options, the devil's in the details. So if you want to apply a writ large, all trades are sized at 6, you can do that. You're going to have issues with that for a bunch of different reasons, which I'll show you why. The other thing is if you just size off of how you feel, that's another set of issues, which we're going to talk about that as well. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the outliers. Shout out to the Patreon family. Consider joining. And if not, you should at least hop in our free discord. It's another cool spot to hang out. Let's talk about this in a nutshell. So why are we doing this? Well, here's a deal. If we take a look at these different utilization levels, let's say you have a single strategy. And in that single strategy on Monday, in January, you size at 1, then in February, 6, that at the end of February, on a Thursday, it's 2, stone and so forth. What I'm highlighting here is that if it is just a shotgun blast of sizing, there's nothing that you can logically project the performance. You",

You could, rationally, come up with an average and then use that. The issue with that is you might find this 29 kind of scenario could actually lead to enough drawdown that you then couldn't put this trade on anymore. So you can't approach sizing trades haphazardly. So what does the process look like? For me, I try to keep it straightforward. I start with looking at the portfolio as you probably would imagine. Now, when I'm doing this, I'm making sure that I'm defining the objectives for what I'm looking to add. What this means is if your goal is to aggressively grow your portfolio, guess what that means? You probably need to use most of it most of the time. You do not have the luxury of sitting 30 cash waiting for things to pop up. Again, depending on your trading style, maybe that actually does fit in, which will get into it a little bit. But in general, if you're trying to aggressively grow your portfolio, you have to be pretty aggressive with your utilization. Same thing with the subsequent sizing of your positions.

Same thing with the subsequent sizing of your positions. And it's the inverse is true if you're looking to reduce variance in your portfolio returns. Then maybe you're not sizing things quite as large because you want to keep more on the side so that you're not experiencing the same variance. This is why after you look at your portfolio, defining these objectives is a non-negotiable part of the process. Once we do that, this is when I actually start the process of sizing a position. And it's relatively straightforward. I'm going to start by looking at how this trade fits into a portfolio. I'm going to understand what my hypothesis is for this trade. What the corresponding strategy is from there. This will lead me to however much money I'm going to allocate to the position.

If this concept is completely foreign to you, I will throw a link in the notes below that walks through this, but it doesn't really matter. You can literally get rid of this in its entirety if you were so inclined. And you could just say, I have a 100,000 portfolio. Then you can determine how you want to size positions off of that. There's a couple things to keep in mind. Now for me, for the core allocation of a portfolio, I tend to accept larger position sizes. So this is using a generic answer. Up to 70 of the portfolio can be in the core of that 70 all of it can be into one position if I am so inclined. This is not 70 of the 70. I'm using it as a total of the portfolio to keep this easier to follow along for everybody. So what does this mean?

If I were not to do this, then I would treat most of the positions as speculative. There's a couple ways you have to think about this and the way that I tend to apply sizing. If I'm meeting my return objectives with the core allocation, I will give this more money. If I'm not meaning, let's say IWM is not doing well or if the market's going down and the coverage strangle are not performing well, then I'm going to size up the speculative allocation of the portfolio. In this case, I might juice this up to 60 of the portfolio and keep the remainder in the core. You have to find what metrics make sense for you. In general, I want to try to keep as much capital as I possibly can in the core allocation because it gives me the most amount of flexibility depending on what the market's choosing to do. Now, another caveat. If I'm trying to aggressively grow my portfolio, I'm going to bump this 70 down. This might be",

    "text": "keep as much capital as I possibly can in the core allocation because it gives me the most amount of flexibility depending on what the market's choosing to do. Now, another caveat. If I'm trying to aggressively grow my portfolio, I'm going to bump this 70 down. This might be up to 60, but it might generally run around 30 something like that. You have to figure out the way you try to split your portfolio. In this case, going with this example, if we have 70,000 allocated to IWM, let's say the initial outlay is 35,000 half of the position, then I'm using that residual capital, the remaining 35,000 and I'm going to look at IWM every time it makes a 5 move up or down, a 10 move up or down, whatever your strategy calls for. But this scaling piece is really important as well as this outlay. Here's how I think about it. If I'm allocating 70,000 and I have a very strong conviction in my trade, meaning I want to maximize as much of my exposure to the trade hypothesis as possible, this outlay can be up to 100. I could put all of the money out there if I want right up front. What's the downside? You lose the ability to scale both to the upside and to the downside. So with something like a covered strangle, we're adding risk as things go down similar to dollar cost averaging. That becomes problematic, so I tend",

And if you're curious about how I run finances for this strategy by itself, I will throw a link in the video below. Now, let's say you're not looking to split your portfolio out into corn speculative. Don't worry, I got you. Let's take a look at if we had speculative trades only. So in this case, I have position set to be up to 10. This is again a generality. I definitely would not want speculative positions exceeding 15. When I'm sizing things, I try to give myself room. Again, this is up to 70 up to 15. That means in general, I'm going to look to size about 10. Some people might look at that and say, wow, that's like really large for an individual position. It could be for you. Maybe you're better off looking at something like 5. Here's the thing you have to consider.

Here, when I'm looking at this, these are both strategies that are going to use most of the money upfront. So for me, I'm looking to find a balance. If you size things too small, you have to put on a bunch of stuff that might be okay for the way you trade. That might be a headache again, depending on how you trade. So this number in general, it's going to be variable based on what you're looking for. So when we look at then, perhaps adding another position. So we have this Tesla ratio called diagonal, this thing's out and running its bullish and you want to get bullish in Nvidia as well. How do we think about the sizing of that? If you'll remember, we need to look at the portfolio because Tesla and Nvidia behave very much like one another. They're very correlated. So am I going to use the maximum allocation for position sizing in this instance? If I already have something that's behaving quite like it, maybe if that's the exposure I want, maybe not.

You can put on a similar, notional value position using way less money with options. Let's say for example, we buy this deep in the money 91 delta call at 155. This means you're controlling 15,500 worth of Apple using 35 hundred bucks. So when you buy this position, do we use the 15,500 or the 3500? Well, depends on the way you think about this. But for me, I would be using the actual capital I have committed to the trade. Now, there's an inverse scenario. Let's say you choose sell a put in Apple and let's say you come in here to the 27 delta 180. Well, in this scenario, I have portfolio margin. You'll see that the margin requirement is only 1800 bucks. But technically, the max loss is undefined all the way down to zero. So your loss potential is way more than the 1800. So in this kind of scenario, if you're using an undefined risk trade, me, I think the best practical scenario is to define the risk.",

So in this kind of scenario, if you're using an undefined risk trade, me, I think the best practical scenario is to define the risk. So in this case, based on your trading plan and your strategy outlines, which you have as Apple falls below your strike, if this is a cash secured put, you'll say, okay, well, then I would buy this option. That means I need the money to buy 100 shares at 180. If that's not what you want to do, you need to define a period that you either would hedge the position via short shares, or you need to find a point that you would exit for the position at a loss. And you need to define that before you enter your trade, that will give you your value at risk. There are some downsides here because markets can move. The value at risk you are postulating is saying, if I intervene, I would be able to do it at this point, which you may or may not be able to do it exactly at that point. So you have to give it some slack. Next up, we have this idea of expected return. This is a guiding concept.

The reason why expected return is so important is because it lets us see how a system will perform in the long run, which is another consideration for you is that you have to consider both individual trades and systematic returns. What does that mean? Well, if you have a trade that's so big that one loss can erase your account, but in the long run, it looks like it would make money. It doesn't matter because you have so much value at risk that one losing position can completely detract your ability for any future returns. So you have to think about that, but you also have to balance it with the systematic returns. Because if you have a process that returns a modest amount of money, you might say, eh, this doesn't look that great. But then if you project it out over a long enough time frame, it starts to make a lot of sense. So when we're doing this kind of thought process and sizing things, one of the concepts to remember is the sequence of returns. What do you expect to see? So in this case, I'm giving you guys a chart, a reference chart. The number of consecutive losses is here on the Y axis, and then the X axis is the probability of a",

The number of consecutive losses is here on the Y axis, and then the X axis is the probability of a win. So what's the probability of having five consecutive losses with a 60 chance of winning 1. So this means that you can look at whatever strategy you're running, look at the average losing size of that strategy. And you say, okay, there's a 1 chance I could lose five in a row. How much would I lose if I lost five in a row? And you can do some math to figure out if you can withstand draw downs based on the probability of experiencing consecutive losses. We already talked about correlation. This has to be baked into your system. We also need to think about what kind of move we're trying to trade and how much risk we're taking to get there. For example, if you are risking 10,000 to make a 50 cent move, expected return will tell you that doesn't make sense. So both of these are tied intimately with one another.

At the end of the day, you have to make it make sense. What this means is in this example, if we have a 100,000 account, we want a 15 return per year, but we only allow ourselves 1 positions and we're managing those at 50 saying that they're short premium strategies. Well, that's going to give you 1,000 per trade. You're going to have to put on a bunch of them, right? 1,000 if we're trying to get this 15, you're going to have to put on at least 50 of them probably more. This puts you in these crappy little trades that you're making 45 bucks over 20 days. This gives you 540 a year. What I'm highlighting in this instance is that it doesn't make sense.
