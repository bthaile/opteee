    "text": "One of the easiest ways to spot some sort of grifter, shell, bullshed artist is if they're talking about trading and they're just talking about their wins. Or if they talk about the dollar sizes of their wins. For anybody that's been in trading any duration of time, the topic we will talk about the most are the losses. And it's because for most of us as traders, we love winning, we love making money, but the losses are really interesting because they identify gaps in our process problems with what we're doing. And we all know that they're there and we share those to help each other get better. So if you're listening to somebody only talking about how they're making 5,000 in 14 milliseconds, it's just bullshit. That's not to say that you can't make a lot of money fast because you can, but for the people that focus on that, they typically have some bullshit to sell you.",
