Um, roaring clities says because we chat a bit about your favorite DD that you read on your own this week. No. So all the DDs that I'm reading, they're the old ones that were skimming through. So it's just so that I'm not missing anything. I'm not my, I'm actually very purposefully moving in line with you all on the live streams as I'm opening up new DDs. But for some of the older DDs that we've already taken a look at, we've gone through and we've kind of skim through some of the stuff just because again, some of them are pretty long. So I'm not actually, yeah, I'm not actually like opening up new stuff yet. Richard so it says control P. I, I want to trust you. I want to trust you, but I'm just, I'm nervous that that's going to, all right, let's do it control P. No, that's print. That's control print. I was like, what?

Like that is exactly what I try to do. The problem that I take with the word lie here is that it paints a picture holistically that the reporting is being purposefully misreported by everybody across the board into perpetuity. And that might just be the general inference. And I'm not saying whether that's right or wrong. But for me, I would frame it more as like misreporting, whether it's driven by purposeful intent. That's something that we would get into in specific instances. But there is a reality that a lot of these institutions do have massive reporting functions. And it's not always perfect. Look at any job you've ever worked at and look at the required paperwork following, filing process. It's never perfect. There's always errors. So all I'm saying is that I wouldn't feel comfortable chalking up the reporting. Always forever, unanimously across all instances being lies, being purposefully done. Is that the majority of cases? I don't know. Maybe it definitely seems like it's known in certain circumstances without a fucking doubt. So I'm not saying that there's not lying going on. There",

But I try to emphasize that point specifically. Roryntiti, what up, Roryntiti? Roryntiti says, GME is a shit ton of errors over and over and over again. Here's the problem. If you are to look around, have you ever had this sensation while you're driving? You just get a new car or maybe you got a used car and your car is white. Or if you watch family guy and you like cool whip, it's white. And as you're driving around all of a sudden, you start seeing all these white cars. You're like, where the fuck did all of these white cars come from? They're everywhere. I've never seen as many white cars in my life. I just got a white car. Everybody obviously is just vibing with me in my white car. You know exactly what that is. Right? It's an attribution that mentally happens when you pick something of interest and you begin looking for it. You have a white car. You like white cars. You just bought your white car. Everybody now is a white car. So with GameStop, I notice that the default everybody has is that everything is fucked. It's",

And it's because they're clearly our instances that it has happened. I'm not saying that it's not the case. It could be the case for sure. It could be. But what I'm saying is with especially the GameStop crowd, the default that we tend to see is manipulation is lies is stuff like that because it's what we're looking for. Fun fact, if you go into any other stock, you will find some of these same things. Not saying the same exact things. Not saying to the same degree. I'm not saying anything like that. What I'm saying is that if you look at Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo magically opens up new accounts for people that don't exist. It's complete and utter bullshit. There are other instances where Wells Fargo was thought to have opened up bullshit accounts for people. They were starting to become ostracized for it.

So I go into that whole tirade just to highlight the term lies here. I think starts to send people down a certain mental path inherently. And you should just be aware of it. You could fully agree with it. That's cool. But a lot of people they'll just read this stuff. They'll take it as face value. They'll say, oh, yeah, these motherfuckers are purposely lying to us all the time. And that's now the base going forward. And it should be a conscious choice if that's what you choose to believe. If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice. What is that? I think that's a rush song. I think it's a rush song. Let's go. The broker dealer can lie without immediately facing consequences, which we saw. And here's another thing to highlight in addition to this realistically. The fact that the consequences aren't that fucking bad. Right? So I think in the last DD, this is what, yeah, these we were, I was on my little tiny setup.

But for somebody like Goldman Sachs, it's a cost that they want business dog. They don't even fucking care. So another thing to highlight is not just the immediacy component, which is there, but there's the severity component, which is the punishment is so non-severe that why would they care? They don't care. It allows firms to operate in a high risk environment without exposing how big their risk appetite is. Another example, West mentioned Merrill Lynch, find 450k in 16 for using securities held in their customers accounts to cover their own trades. That's fine. I need to click into this. Yeah, this looks okay. Run it. Let's see. Now for a quick highlight, sometimes people will ask me like, Eric, why, why have you become so obsessed and spend so much time looking at GameStop? And I've given the reason a bunch of different times, but I want to highlight a specific element of that because if you were to post on a place like X, and if you were to post, do you think Merrill Lynch is doing this?

And it is classic. This is one of the reasons why GameStop is so cool. So what I'm actually going to do is highlight this, grab a screenshot, and you know, the next step is just throw this shit on X so that people can come take a look at the fun facts for themselves and see what they think.

The findings stated that there were approximately 13,190 instances in which there were inconsistencies between the short positions held in the firm's accounts that required reporting to the Loper. And the short positions that the firm actually had reported to Loper in these instances, the firm had inaccurately reported its reportable options positions to Loper because of proprietary system flaw, cause the firm to omit the short contract quantities from being reported to Loper, confirm accounts that held short straddles the firm subsequently corrected this flaw. So we can look at this and we can say two things. The first thing is we can say, don't believe them system flaw, complete bullshit, they're lying. We can say believable systems do be flowing sometimes plausible. This one individual instance, I would be indifferent. One instance in different, there's 55 disclosures in here and it looks like again, you can look at 55 instances and you could say, well, that's obviously a big problem and it might be, it might not be.

And again, that's not to suggest that there isn't even if this says that there isn't, but I want to start there. Going back to what I tell you guys all the time, my goal is objective analysis. So read this Finra report and search for any evidence of purposeful purposeful misreporting or gross negligence of reporting. Let's see what it says. I'm actually curious what that'll come back with.

I'll let you know. Okay. The regulatory arbitration disclosures they indicate 55 regulatory events in one arbitration event disclosures about the firm and its control. These events involve regulatory action, civil judicial proceedings and financial matters that the firm is required to disclose. Failure to file suspicious activity reports, SARS. They were fined six million, who were failing to establish adequate policies and controls for reporting suspicious activities as required by the Bank Superse act. The firm failed nearly 1500 SARS over a decade due to applying an incorrect monetary threshold for reporting suspicious activities. You oversights suggests the significant lapse in compliance with regulatory requirements and potentially amongst and potentially accounting to or amounting to gross negligence. Okay. Misuse of customer cash. Here we go. Merrill Lynch was also involved in a case where it misuse customer cash generate profits for the firm. The SEC found that Merrill Lynch violated the customer protection rule by engaging in complex options trades that artificially reduced the required deposit of customer cash and reserve accounts. This violation exposed customers to significant risks and resulted in 450 million settlement with the SEC. That is a glaring issue to me. That kind of thing is not like the and again, you guys hopefully you can tell, hopefully by now, when I'm looking at this stuff,",

So, but I want to talk about this kind of stuff from their perspective. Negligent misrepresentation in annuity sales. There's a lawsuit filed alleging negligent misrepresentation by brokers regarding the features of a variable annuity sold by retired customer. The claim involves allegations of professional malpractice and failure to disclose high internal costs associated with the annuity. Give or take. This one is the worst to me. That one's like fucking egregious. That's nuts. Okay. Don't worry, y'all. We are now past the first page of this single DD. Lord, help me.

Naked short selling occurs when a seller, we already know all that. Market equilibrium and manipulation, the paper models market equilibrium with and without manipulators among short sellers.

This can increase the profitability of manipulative short selling because he faces less risk of a short squeeze. The manipulator can sell short more shares. So I get it.

It does not know how chaos theory can explain unpredictable and complex behaviors and financial systems. Okay, here we go. Interconnected systems. The section posits that the financial markets are interconnected systems where small changes can lead to significant impacts akin to the butterfly effect in chaos theory. This interconnectedness suggests that minor events or trades can trigger larger market movements leading to volatility. Minor events. What does that mean? What does what do they mean by minor event? Let's see if I can find that minor. I'm curious that because the term minor event to me is very specific. Okay. Let's see if I can flip through some of this.",

I have prior to myself an Acrobatist of Scientists. This is interesting. One of the interesting things about this is the timing of these. Like the majority of these is actually after the initial squeeze. So for a lot of these people, they were actually in a very, very quiet period. Let me grab a trading view. Then let's grab GME. So this person posted April 11th, 2021. 2021. Oh man, that's brutal. So I'm seeing a lot of the DD come through and hear where we saw one pop in June and then just down. Until this year.

It's not so much like I don't look at it that way specifically from the context of against short volume. But I look at it against the broader context of how the underlying is moving. That's the main thing that I'm paying attention to personally. All right, let's continue here. Yes, it's just. Susquejana. All right, I'm going to read this. Now we have, uh, appealing new DTCC regs to make things weirder, growing position, prompted me to start doing a deep dive, doubled in size since the start of the pandemic. Interesting. So this looks like they're just like exploring the the structural conflict of interest and whatnot from within Susquejana. You know, I don't see anything in here about the chaos theory. I'm starting to think that Upt just went fucking rogue. Upt didn't say anything about Susquejana. Yeah, I think Upt went absolute rogue. Yep, so they're rich. Other address saw.

And there are a lot of ways to very smartly decrease your tax liabilities, depending on how you structure. As your total resources start to grow, you spend more time learning about stuff like this. It was a couple of years ago that I started doing a ton of research and meeting with different kinds of attorneys and tax preparers to learn more about how this stuff works at a curiosity. Now, the interesting thing is that something like this, depending on how it's structured, can be illegal. It can be perfectly legally set up. So I'm actually really curious what it thinks about this. Because right now we're essentially just highlighting a tax shelter. So now we're getting into like the location of stuff. Here we go. Whether you think this is wrong right? Even loophole location is blank to 9.5 billions of taxes have been evaded as a result of this location. So yeah, because I mean like this, I understand the point that people are making.

But I'm curious like what the tax shelter angle means to them. Because I just, I haven't seen that yet. How is Citadel evolved? Well, it turns out they have an entity tied to the Ugglin house. Of course, it's right. The same entity connected. Yeah. Citadel operating multiple places. I'm struggling to understand what they're like. Connection between Black Rock, Swiss and Citadel, Palafol. Hey, but what's the, I don't understand the implication. Like why? Whether or not there's a connection between these entities, my default is rich, powerful entities all know and operate with one another.

And that's all it is. It's not, it's not like BlackRock and the other entities are all like, oh, we all have to go to this house together. It's just an economy of scale efficiency thing. So another great example of that is here in California, there's a lot of laws, annoying laws about vehicles. And the vehicles itself here, there's like, you can't have all different kinds of stuff. It's really, really strict. So there are places like Wyoming that people will set up LLCs to register the vehicle too so that it's not, it doesn't have to go through California registration and smog. So it's like there are specific entities that exist online to set people up to do those kinds of things. It's the same thing as something like this. It's just an efficiency thing.

The second GME squeeze to be so epic that the protective measures in place won't be sufficient. Okay, so we can conclude that this did not happen. I think I figured out what DFV knows. I am now very interested in this one. This one I'm absolutely going to read this whole thing because this I'm supremely interested in. If you look at the options volume out of the money, 16th, April, you'll notice that it's much higher than any other time throughout the history of stock. Yes. My belief that DFV knows that shittadella is no long positions in GME and only has calls and puts in GME. When your options expire out of the money and you have no other positions in the stock but shorts, you literally have nothing. Makes sense as to why the shorts have been dragging it out this long. You never give up in an option until it expires. That's not how that works. If there's a chance, there's a chance, you still have skin in the game, institutions don't work like this man.

That's just not how they're going to run position. If your options expire out of the money, no long positions, you have no leg left to stand on, no more skin in the game, nothing else you can do but cover your short positions. I don't understand what this means. They don't have any skin left in the game and any more legs to stand on. What? Why not buy your puts then for a year? The week of 16 April stock was 45 per share and going down. Yeah, this one's the thing tough.

Yeah, this one a little tricky. All right. Why trading halted in January? Well, I think we kind of know this. Don't we? The fucking market was about to explode. The Dredels plan is to route retail order system as possible. 70 to 90 of retail traders lose money. I hate statistics like that, but it's not fully inaccurate. By issuing a short share on the trade instead of locating it. Yes. So we know that we're doing this. This is same. This wasted it shut down trading and why? This will never not be funny to me. It will not be funny to me that I'm sitting here on a fucking YouTube live stream, really like trying to understand the theories and the assumptions about market, micro structure and stuff like that. And I'm learning from people called robbing your mom. Only shut down trading out. I love that they call them this. And that's why we just heard the last congressional hearing directly from TTC. Lauren says the market almost exploded and they made a video about retail trade. They made a video about retail investors doing research. What was it? Lauren, what was that? Do you have the video link to that Lauren? I would love to watch it. Reece says someone messes up option talk. Eric",

So my preference is if somebody doesn't know something about something, just don't talk about it, just leave it alone.

They're now locked into assuming that every share purchased during the runoff also wasn't for shares. Citadel page states our automated equities platform. Okay. Okay. Interesting.

The tricky part that we have to say is that again, this is one of the problems when people like to promulgate something that they want to be true or want to believe because when we say something like, headgees are fucked from 2021, the reality, like the overwhelming reality is that genuinely, like that as much as I don't like them, they're still here and they're still making buckets of money. So I like the message and I like the idea of like trying to call out the errors and stuff, but I think one of the problems here is that that like the headgees unfortunately are not fucked and they're continuing to make buckets of money as they tend to do because I don't want to go quite as far as saying something is like too big to fail because they can something can always fail, but they have so many disgusting internal efficiencies built that they're not, again, I wouldn't say that they're too big to fail, but they're not that far off of being too big to fail.

Roing City says in the congressional hearings during the 2008 financial crisis too big to fail, yeah, exactly. And that's why too big to fail is such a like nefarious concept because something is too big to fail until it fails, but there are massive, massive economies of scale that bigger entities have like these guys that make it really like again, objectively speaking, a lot of these hedge funds literally should have gone bankrupt during the squeeze in 21. The entities that were so short and did not cover, they absolutely should have gone bankrupt, but because they were in a sense too big to fail because it was going to start jeopardizing the broad market, they essentially were bailed out.

Now, from a practical standpoint, obviously, that makes no sense because I'm in markets personally to try to make money.

I'll still flip through it out of sheer curiosity. But it's 2024 now and we're not fucked. Things are still moving along, chugging along, okay.

Nobody's at any point in three months to talk about shit in the markets. It literally takes probably three to five years to genuinely get your fucking feet under you. That's not even at the point where I would consider that person supremely proficient or anything like that. I've come across plenty of traders that have done super well over three or four year periods. And they are exceedingly confident because they've crushed it for a specific period of time until they realize that they've only seen one element of the market. And then the market throws a curveball, something new comes out that they haven't seen yet.

Because they're looking at a lot of things that are slightly related, slightly not related like margin debt, for example, margin debt is way way way more complex than looking at a pickup and margin debt from different time frames again through a global pandemic, what that might mean. Also what the new financial picture might look like. So yeah, I believe like they're literally talking about fucking FDIC insurance. That's like end of world kind of shit. So to say stuff like my goal is not to incite panic, but then to say for those panicking, I think you can cash in on your FDIC insurance. That's inciting panic. Like that's what that is. Interesting. I mean, it's an interesting thing. It's cool to see somebody learning about economic functions, but it also highlights how complex economic markets are economics and markets are.

So that's at least my hope. All right. So let's see what GPT says. Article attached discusses the concept of everything short. Series suggests that several hedge funds have been strategically shorting a wide range of stocks to manipulate market dynamics. hedge funds like Citadel Melvin Capital and others develop significant positions in various companies. Funds are accused of systematically shorting stocks of companies that compete with their favorite investments. Sure I could see that. The author implies that these hedge funds engage in practices that resemble market manipulation. They might short stocks of companies like GameStop or AMC to suppress their price while supporting competitors like Amazon or Netflix. So here's the problem that we start running into here is when we're talking about systemic shorting like that to that scale. I'm not saying it can happen. It can but it becomes really really difficult to do so and the reason why it's difficult to do so is because markets",

So unless that there's other entities that are also in collusion that are like yeah okay we'll just let this thing get crushed. Sooner or later there will be entities even like Ryan Cohen. He does it not in an investing standpoint but in terms of scooping in on businesses and turning them around. Investors will do that traders will do that because it's if we see something that gets pushed down to a level that doesn't make sense based on the valuation. A lot of people will enter into that market and buy it because it makes sense it's such a value and this straight up has been the case. You can literally see it happening in GameStop. If we zoom this in you can see GameStop got absolutely punished and it's because objectively speaking the business of GameStop during this period did not look great. I'm not trying to talk shit.

Most of it's done at home via Amazon and then you buy the games on the console. So I've been playing a game called Starfield which is actually super cool. You get to cruise around space but then GameStop starts to turn things around pretty massively and that's why I'm so excited about the move from here because the move from here is market internal driven. This move happens because people are starting to see options activity. I saw the options activity. I start to get in because there's activity other people are in and it incentivizes participation in that way. That's great. Then what starts to happen here is different. This isn't being kicked off because of a lot of transactions in options markets. The options markets are busy but they're not crazy. It's nothing like we saw in the beginning of the middle of the year in the summer.

But if there's underlying value in the company that's seen accepted and understood, there will be people that are going to buy it because of the fundamental components of the company longer term. And that will in turn put the shorts in a really tough position. So it's just not as simple as saying hedge funds are doing blank because hedge funds have a lot of resources and power. There's a lot of different hedge funds. We can't bucket them all the same. They do different things. They have different imperatives.

Companies like Amazon and Walmart, they're fucking huge. So the idea that one of them is being suppressed to prop the other one up would be dubious. I don't think that's a fair assertion to make.

We've had every kind of interesting idea about what's driving price movement and stuff like that. But regardless of all of that, none of them have moved things quite like volume.

On balance volume. Okay. I'm going to take this from my other post. The commonality between all these graphs is on balance volume continues to increase. Okay. Okay. So one of the issues with this is like drawing any sort of standard technical analysis lines. I think these are each of Moku clouds, by the way, here if I'm not mistaken, is this right? But drawing technical analysis like this off of a squeeze doesn't really make sense in my opinion. And the reason why it doesn't make sense is because you have to apply a completely different style of technical analysis around squeezes. You can apply standard support. Like think about what technical analysis represents. It represents analyzing the relationship between buyers and sellers in open marketplace. So it's looking at price and volume. Well, price and volume as represented through supply and demand, those functions have certain inferences we can make from them that completely break down during a short squeeze. People that were buying GameStop at 500 were partially psychotic retail traders that are trying to see how much money they can make hoping it goes higher. And I say psychotic just because that's a massive amount of money to pay for a stock that just before was down at whatever. So",

So it would have worked if necessarily they weren't stock when they turned the buy button off and price was allowed to continue to move. But that's before financial ruin of the markets in which case nobody gets anything. So that part aside, the entities that are buying shares there, they're not buying it because they actually think it's valued at 5.13. They don't think that the company's fundamentally valued there. They're buying it because they quite literally are forced to cover short positions, which is great. Fuck them. But that's not standard supply and demand functions. It's very, very unique. So you have to apply a completely different methodology. So I actually think drawing lines like basing things off of this is a broken methodology. But just because I think it's a broken methodology doesn't mean it doesn't work, doesn't mean it's not efficacious. It literally doesn't mean anything like that because technical analysis is very much part, part science. So they're fully entitled to do that. That's just my personal opinion on it. Yep. So I saw it.

Short squeeze is not happening yet. This is great. Volumist king. The short squeeze has not happened yet. I understand what they're inferring here. But again, just for clarity, sake of short squeeze, absolutely as fucking happened. Probably the biggest one that the company will see at least uninterrupted. And I emphasize that point because the uninterrupted component is huge. Does this mean that there couldn't be a bigger short squeeze in the future? There always could be, right? The worst days, depending on what side of the trade around are always ahead. So that I think is completely fair. And to think that there could be a bigger squeeze in the future, I think that's completely fair. The problem is at what point does it get stopped? That's the problem.

So the probability of there being another short squeeze that's equivalent or bigger, I think would be difficult to justify. Again, from a practical standpoint, not from a structural standpoint, not saying that there aren't the conditions for it to occur. But at what and this is one of the things that I notice is missing from a lot of the diligence and positions people oppose is that we don't apply a practical methodology of the fact that it's going to be interrupted. Market forces, external, will interrupt it just like they already did. So they've already showed that they're not willing to allow the financial system to collapse because of this. And again, from that perspective, I don't blame them. I don't want the financial system to collapse either because of this. But it would be really cool to see if there's a bit of a line that's balanced where we actually allow some of the hedge funds and stuff to go out of business as they should.

And then it should be, I think, sequestered so that it doesn't destroy an entire financial system. But yeah, this, I understand the sentiment here, but I make that point for everybody because I know everybody's really, really interested and hopeful for Firm Moas. But one of the things that I haven't heard an explanation for, which I genuinely am interested. I genuinely, genuinely am interested in hearing is how does the theory of Moas apply if this, if the squeeze that's coming is supposedly bigger than the squeeze that already happened, if the first squeeze was already interrupted, I don't understand that logic. Roryn Cleedy says the thing is if you apply that practicality to a DD and post on Reddit, then you're down what into hell and call to shill. Understandably, because it's a community and group of people that have been manipulated for as long as they've been around.

I think a lot of the people that get called a shill rightfully so are people that are just bad-mouthing things with uninformed opinions and not something that's well researched. But for example, the comment I make that a lot of people would call me a show for on there is saying the statement that I don't see a larger squeeze happening if the first squeeze was stopped. So, but the way that I phrase it as a question, because it's a genuine question, the genuine question I have is how do we rationalize that there would be a bigger squeeze in the future if the smaller squeeze was manually interrupted by market forces?

Lauren says, retail traders are learning. Gotta give people room to grow absolutely. I still think GME will pop a little. Oh, absolutely. And again, I want to be super clear. That doesn't mean that I can't squeeze. I think GME is one of those companies that's literally primed to squeeze. I'm just clarifying the idea of... I think we need to be... I think we need to be able to answer the question of how does Moas happen if the first squeeze was cut.

Rune Clity says, would change in ways for it to continue, hold on. Rune Clity says, so let me preface by saying I don't personally believe this, but the answer to how could there be a bigger squeeze that regulation, both internal and external to the financial system, would change in ways for it to continue without interference. Right. But that argument doesn't make sense because the reason for interference previously was literally to prevent the meltdown of the financial system. So there isn't a",

But that argument doesn't make sense because the reason for interference previously was literally to prevent the meltdown of the financial system. So there isn't a scenario where there's enough regulation that would allow more risk assumption. Now, I do think that there's a world where the squeeze could be permitted to the point where individual hedge funds might literally go bankrupt. But I don't think even in a malgamation of a lot of those hedge funds would be enough money to yield like this massive massive squeeze. DCM says bigger squeeze because the first time there were several stocks squeezing all at once, two of those companies already went bankrupt. So pressure is already less. I don't think that explains it either, in my opinion. So to clarify the position I'm offering is the last squeeze was interrupted because there was a potential for literally the financial system to collapse. That happens when there's a certain amount of risk out that's uncovered for whatever reason and that there's enough variance and liquidity that can yield that kind of collapse. So if external entities stepped in to stop that from happening previously, I don't see how there would be a world where we would permit more risk if the last round of risk was already kept lower.

I don't think that at all. The pre-existing safety triggers and stuff like that would be things like circuit breakers. But yeah, I think circuit breakers are completely different than that. Roryn Clity says what external entities stepped in to stop the last one, the brokers. So the brokers across the board turned off the ability to buy shares. Lazy says do you think there will ever be any type of accountability for allowing it to get this bad? I hope. I think that there's a potential but the problem is that in general, the accountability component there is directly disincentivized from the largest constituents of the system. So I think that there's a conflict of interest from their perspective to actually gain accountability. So I think that you would need to have some sort of very aggressive entity that enters SEC, Fenra, like these different oversight commissions and organizations that actually doesn't care about the conflict of interest and the potential harm that comes from moving through it and pursuing it that way.

Lauren says they weren't expecting GME to do what it did and they took care and who they took care of is very telling. I agree with you, fully agree with you. BCM says the buy button was turned off because of a massive fake trade that was immediately reversed and that's why the buy button was turned off. The financial system wasn't going to collapse only some larger. I actually don't agree with that.

I don't know how they're arriving at negative beta here. Carlos says there will be no GME squeeze get it through your thick head. I actually don't agree with that either. I absolutely think there can be a squeeze. I think the nature and level of a squeeze can be different. But yeah. All right. Let's add a comment here. This will be 30 no. Be va. This way we can find that again. Very interesting. So to summarize the multiple dds we went through and just kind of at a high level what I'm seeing. I'm seeing a lot of really pervasive focus on manipulation, which is fair. The various entities and the relationship between entities, which I think is good. I see a lot of confirmation bias in trying to paint a specific picture that people want to see, which is very normal. I see a lot of loosely formed opinions with respect to future price direction.

I also see the overwhelming majority of what we've read did not happen, at least in terms of price performance so far of GameStop.

    "text": "the trends are that I can piece together from a high perspective. So a lot of work, a lot of work goes into these. The other thing that I definitely can pick up on is the level of interest in GameStop is insane in that people are clearly willing, like that one that was going through the tax shelters and stuff. That's a very edge case peripheral topic that somebody spent a lot of time digging into the very specific details that they were able to piece together, which is really impressive to me. The fact that people do that. It's very cool. It's one of the reasons why I'm so stoked and eager to continue learning about GameStop and what we can pick up. So I'm excited to keep working through the DDS that we have. I actually think what I'm going to do is split this though, because we're actually making pretty good progress at this point. And if I split the document, I should be able to move through it through the AI thing and hear a little more efficiently, which would be cool. So before we wrap, though, is there anything else that you guys want to take a look at? Obviously, we'll continue the DD. I think next Saturday. Yeah, next Saturday is good. We have a bunch of travel next month. So you'll see me on the mobile setup again. But yeah, let me know if there's anything that we want to hit real",

But yeah, let me know if there's anything that we want to hit real quick before we bounce. As always, thank you guys for hanging out. I think I've been seeing people share in the live stream around, which is awesome. I'm really appreciative of that. That really helps me because it helps grow our audience, which then helps inform where I get information from. And I essentially continue to cast a wider net because you guys are helping me and teaching me. So thank you all for for that. Anti-governments, this thoughts on archer aviation. These streams are really specific to GameStop. So I'm happy to talk about that. If you want, unless you think it's related to GameStop somehow, then I'm happy to look at it. But otherwise, you can always bring that up on like the Monday live stream or the Friday live stream, something like that. But yeah. All right, guys, abs. Hold on. Runkley says, do we ever put together a full-fledged meme stock portfolio that would be cool to take a look at if we already have it? Yeah. So I think we built that a little while ago, and I was running it for a little bit. And then I reconfigured the live schedule. So right now,",

So I think we built that a little while ago, and I was running it for a little bit. And then I reconfigured the live schedule. So right now, we can probably talk about it on Monday during the Monday live stream at some point. That would be okay. But yeah, right now the live streams are Monday is YouTube Wednesday is outlier pro. Friday is is just trading basics. Saturday GameStop Sunday outlier pro. And then Tuesday Thursday is kind of just trader hangout as it's coin now. It's just a chance to bullshit for a little bit and talk markets. So ECM King says, GME isn't a meme stock in my opinion. That's a completely fair opinion to have. I think it objectively is. But I think it's because people have a really negative connotation of meme stock and I don't think it's a negative connotation. I literally think based on the original definition when we started that series about meme stocks, it's literally stocks that are popularly talked about. And I don't think that that's a negative connotation at all. I think a lot of people apply a negative connotation that it's like some sort of like uninformed position or stuff like that, which I would agree. Like I don't think that's it at all. And I also don't think GameStop's price mover right now is",

I think GameStop has a completely viable underlying business and they're starting to pivot. So that's what I think. All right, y'all. Enjoy the rest of your weekend for the outlier pro members. Don't forget to do your performance AAR for the month so that we can review them tomorrow. Be an outlier. I will see you all later.",
