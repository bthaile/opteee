I'm not my, I'm actually very purposefully moving in line with you all on the live streams as I'm opening up new DDs. But for some of the older DDs that we've already taken a look at, we've gone through and we've kind of skim through some of the stuff just because again, some of them are pretty long.

One of the things to highlight on a side, when we're looking at this is my approach to analyzing stuff is genuinely to try and remain as objective as humanly possible. Like that is exactly what I try to do. The problem that I take with the word lie here is that it paints a picture holistically that the reporting is being purposefully misreported by everybody across the board into perpetuity. And that might just be the general inference. And I'm not saying whether that's right or wrong. But for me, I would frame it more as like misreporting. Whether it's driven by purposeful intent, that's something that we would get into in specific instances. But there is a reality that a lot of these institutions do have massive reporting functions. And it's not always perfect. Look at any job you've ever worked at and look at the required paperwork following, filing, process. It's never perfect. There's always errors. So all I'm saying is that I wouldn't feel comfortable chalking up the reporting. Always forever, unanimously across all instances being lies, being purposefully done. Is that the majority of",

And here's another thing to highlight in addition to this realistically. The fact that the consequences aren't that fucking bad. Right? So I think in the last DD, this is what, yeah, these we were, I was on my little tiny setup. So it's hard for me to read all the details. But I mean, the penalties are fucking jokes. Even a 600,000 fine, that sounds kind of aggro. But for somebody like Goldman Sachs, it's a cost to do a business dog. They don't even fucking care. So another thing to highlight is not just the immediacy component, which is there, but there's the severity component, which is the punishment is so non-severe that why would they care? They don't care. It allows firms to operate in a high risk environment without exposing how big their risk appetite is. Another example, West mentioned Merrill Lynch, find 450k in 16 for using securities held in their customers accounts to cover their own trades. That's fine. I need to click into this. Yeah, this looks okay. Run it. Let's see. Now for a quick highlight, sometimes people will ask me like, Eric, why, why have you become so obsessed and spend so much time looking at GameStop? And I've given the reason a bunch of different times, but I want to highlight a specific element of that because if you were to",

Most people would probably say, yeah, I believe so. And it's just because of the way that the question is framed and most people are distrustful of larger financial institutions. But if we were to take an actually well-framed objective question for this, I don't think a lot of people are aware. My self included that this is a fucking thing. I did not know this. And it is classic. This is one of the reasons why GameStop is so cool. So what I'm actually going to do is highlight this, grab a screenshot, and you know, the next step is just throw this shit on X so that people can come take a look at the fun facts for themselves and see what they think. Not GME, identifying continued systemic fraud again. Perfect. Unclothed salamanders says, hi, on topic of bone cone 35, please advise if be bone. It's a great question.

It was actually really impressive. But they stopped taking like the lower dollar amount submissions and like skipping over those for the expensive ones. But I tell you what, dollar 99 get my attention every time. I'm here for you. But like we talked about on Friday, the probability of being bone there was pretty low. So the probability for this coming week is I surmise also likely fairly low. We can take a quick look just so that we know exactly what it do be. Let's grab a good old GameStop. And then let's take a look at our probabilities. And then let's take a look at the probability of a touch just like Catholic priests.

Without admitting or denying the findings, the firm consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that the firm inaccurately reported certain of its listed option positions to the large option position reporting system, Loper, good old Loper, y'all know about Loper. In violation of New York sausage change American rule 906, the findings stated that there were approximately 13,190 instances in which there were inconsistencies between the short positions held in the firm's accounts that required reporting to the Loper. And the short positions that the firm actually had reported to Loper in these instances, the firm had inaccurately reported its reportable options positions to Loper because of proprietary system flaw, cause the firm to omit the short contract quantities from being reported to Loper, infirm accounts that held short straddles the firm subsequently corrected this flaw. So we can look at this and we can say two things. The first thing is we can say, don't believe them system flaw complete bullshit they're lying. We can say believable systems do be flowing sometimes plausible. This one individual instance I would be indifferent. One instance indifferent.

Popular private equity financing instrument floating price convertible securities can resolve the unraveling problem because the manipulator doesn't have to buy back shares in the open market can obtain as many conversion shares as needed by short selling the price downward just prior to the conversion notice date. The flawed structure of the floating price convertibles contract may actually give security holders an incentive to manipulate the issuers share price downwards. Damn. Huh. This can increase the profitability of manipulative short selling because he faces less risk of a short squeeze the manipulator can sell short more shares. So I get it.

Black Rock isn't just looking to kill off Melvin, maybe working with the government and said to make some major changes happen to the market. Okay. And goal.

I don't think that they're explicitly targeting poor people. I think big entities will target anybody that they can get money from or take advantage of. But, yeah.

We're going to have to get the apes to follow like standard paper writing format with like an abstracting conclusions. Now, this is where I connected that's form of theory. The majority of US markets have switched from mortgage-backed CDOs to CLOs, foundation following the 08. If GME squeezes again, Reddit research counterfeit US treasure, oh, Jesus Christ. The second GME squeeze to be so epic that the protective measures in place won't be sufficient. Okay. So, we can conclude that this did not happen. I think I figured out what DFV knows. I am now very interested in this one. This one, I'm absolutely going to read this whole thing because this I'm supremely interested in. If you look at the options volume out of the money, 16th, April, you'll notice that it's much higher than any other time throughout the history of stock. Yes. My belief that DFV knows that shittadella is no long positions in GME and only has calls and puts GME. When your options expire out of the money and you have no other positions in the stock, but shorts, you literally have nothing. Makes sense as to why the shorts have been dragging it out this long.

They literally can just continue the options position. You just roll it. And they absolutely have the money to maintain the position as long as they legitimately would want if that's the case. So I just, I don't think that holds any weight. I also don't think this idea of DFV knowing whatever this actually means. And then matching puts with calls, like that doesn't really mean anything.

What I've gathered are three months of investing, three months. You tell me what you think. The title of my post pretty sums up if I make any mistakes. Okay. So I'm realizing I'm going to have to go through these a little bit faster. So, here's one of the problems I'm starting to notice with some of these DDS is that they're like genuinely exceedingly inexperienced people, which is fine, right? And it's okay to put a DD out and it's okay to share your information. No problem with any of that. But these kinds of like really hyperpolic stuff from people that are really inexperienced in my mind, they get very little credence. I spend very little time on stuff like this.

So what you'll find is people really like to talk about this kind of stuff. It's why if you open up news, most people you'll find that like you'll get news fatigued. The reason why you get news fatigued is when you open up the news, it's always all this horrible shit that's happening all over the place. And it's because people are drawn to that like moths to a flame. For whatever reason, people love some bad shit going on. So this kind of stuff almost always will gain traction and is a very appealing angle for people. It's for that exact reason. It's because it's engaging. So it's always easy to talk about how things can go wrong, how bad things are, how the and the reason why I'm talking about this specific thing is because I've seen different versions of this throughout I've been trading 17 years now.

Because they're looking at a lot of things that are slightly related, slightly not related like margin debt, for example. Margin debt is way, way, way more complex than looking at a tick up and margin debt from different timeframes and again through a global pandemic, what that might mean also what the new financial picture might look like.

    "text": "of stocks to manipulate market dynamics. Okay. hedge funds like citadel melvin capital and others develop develop significant positions in various companies funds are accused of systematically shorting stocks of companies that compete with their favorite investments. Sure, I could see that. Author implies that these hedge funds engage in practices that resemble market manipulation. They might short stocks of companies like game stop or AMC to suppress their price while supporting competitors like Amazon or Netflix. So here's the problem that we start running into here is when we're talking about systemic shorting like that to that scale. I'm not saying it can happen. It can. But it becomes really, really difficult to do so. And the reason why it's difficult to do so is because markets are consensus-driven pricing mechanisms. So unless that there's other entities that are also in collusion that are like, yeah, okay, we'll just let this thing get crushed. Sooner or later, there will be entities even like Ryan Cohen. He does it not in an investing standpoint, but in terms of scooping in on businesses and turning them around investors will do that traders will do that because it's if we see something that gets pushed down to a level that doesn't make sense based on the valuation. So a lot of people will enter into that market and buy it because it makes sense. It's such a value and this straight up has been the case. You can literally see it happening",

And it's because objectively speaking, the business of game stop during this period did not look great. I'm not trying to talk shit. I know that people get sensitive about that. But it's completely true from an objective standpoint. It's a it was a brick and mortar based business that that's a tough way to succeed in an exceedingly digital market in a place where people aren't buying consoles and games physically in store in mass anymore. Most of it's done at home via Amazon and then you buy the games on the console. So I've been playing a game called starfield, which is actually super cool. You get to cruise around space. But then game stop starts to turn things around pretty massively. And that's why I'm so excited about the move from here because the move from here is market internal driven. This move happens because people are starting to see options activity. I saw the options activity.

This isn't being kicked off because of a lot of transactions in options markets. The options markets are busy, but they're not crazy. It's nothing like we saw in the beginning of the well, I guess in the middle of the year in the summer. So the movement that you're starting to see now is an artifact of people. Fundamentally valuing the company differently. That's important. So taking that all the way back to what I'm reading here saying that, you know, hedge funds are essentially manipulating the market to drive price down. It can happen. I'm not saying it doesn't. It does happen. But if there's underlying value in the company that's seen accepted and understood. There will be people that are going to buy it because of the fundamental components of the company longer term. And that will in turn put the shorts in a really tough position. So it's just not as simple as saying hedge funds are doing blank because hedge funds have a lot of resources and power. There's a lot of different hedge funds. We can't bucket them all the same.

So it's looking at price and volume. Well, price and volume as represented through supply and demand. Those functions have certain inferences we can make from them that completely break down during a short squeeze. People that were buying GameStop at 500 were partially psychotic retail traders that are trying to see how much money they can make hoping it goes higher. And I say psychotic just because that's a massive amount of money to pay for a stock that just before was down at whatever. So it would have worked if necessarily they weren't stock when they turned the buy button off and price was a lot to continue to move. But that's before financial ruin of the markets in which case nobody gets anything.

I understand what they're inferring here, but again, just for clarity sake of short squeeze absolutely is fucking happened. Probably the biggest one that the company will see. At least uninterrupted and I emphasize that point because the uninterrupted component is huge. Does this mean that there couldn't be a bigger short squeeze in the future. There always could be right the worst days depending on what's out of the trade around or always ahead. So that I think is completely fair and to think that there could be a bigger squeeze in the future. I think that's completely fair. The problem is at what point does it get stopped. That's the problem and we already know that they stopped the first one. They cut the first one short and the first one was overall lower magnitude. So the the probability of there being another short squeeze that's equivalent or bigger. I think would be difficult to justify again from a practical standpoint not from a structural standpoint not saying that there aren't the conditions for it to occur. But at what and this is one of the things that I notice is missing from a lot of the diligence and positions people will pose is that we don't apply a practical methodology of the fact that it's going to be interrupted market forces external will interrupt it just like they already did.

I don't want the financial system to collapse either because of this. But it would be really cool to see if there's a bit of a line that's balanced where we actually allow some of the hedge funds and stuff to go out of business as they should. And they should be forced to buy it at 500 price. Fuck them. But we should essentially allow those hedge funds to run until they are fucked and completely liquid. And then it should be I think sequestered so that it doesn't destroy an entire financial system.

What did the hell and call the show understandably because it's a community and group of people that have been manipulated for as long as they've been around. And I think that there is an element of an echo chamber where people don't want to necessarily hear too many things that are far too different. But from what I can understand and see from a lot of the ape community, it does seem like there's a growing appetite for healthy discourse and exchange of ideas. So I think that it's not necessarily that far out in the future where you can have a legitimate conversation about these kind of things. I think a lot of the people that get called a shill rightfully so are people that are just bad mouthing things with uninformed opinions and not something that's well researched.

The genuine question I have is how do we rationalize that there would be a bigger squeeze in the future if the smaller squeeze was manually interrupted by market forces.

Ron cliti says would change in ways for it. Allow it to continue hold on. Ron cliti says so let me preface by saying I don't personally believe this but the answer to how could there be a bigger squeeze that regulation both internal and external to the financial system would change in ways for allow it to continue without interference. Right. Right. But that argument doesn't make sense because the reason for interference previously was literally to prevent the meltdown of the financial system. So there isn't a scenario where there's enough regulation that would allow more risk assumption. Now, I do think that there's a world where the squeeze could be permitted to the point where individual hedge funds might literally go bankrupt. But I don't think even in a malgommation of a lot of those hedge funds would be enough money to yield like this massive massive squeeze. DCM says bigger squeeze because the first time there were several stocks squeezing all at once. Two of those companies already went bankrupt so pressure is already less. I don't think that",

DCM says bigger squeeze because the first time there were several stocks squeezing all at once. Two of those companies already went bankrupt so pressure is already less. I don't think that explains it either in my opinion. So to clarify the position I'm offering is the last squeeze was interrupted because there was a potential for literally the financial system to collapse. Happens when there's a certain amount of risk out that's uncovered for whatever reason and that there's enough variance and liquidity that can yield that kind of collapse. So if external entity stepped in to stop that from happening previously. I don't see how there would be a world where we would permit more risk if the last round of risk was already kept lower. Roryn clitty says the way you're talking makes it sound as though you think some sort of pre existing safety triggers were tripped. No, I don't think that I don't even know if those exist. I don't think that at all the pre existing safety triggers and stuff like that would be things like you know circuit breakers. But yeah, I think circuit breakers are completely different than that.

So the brokers across the board turned off the ability to buy shares. Lizzie says do you think there will ever be any type of accountability for allowing it to get this bad. Look, I hope I think that there's a potential, but the problem is is that in general the accountability component there is directly disincentivized from the largest constituents of the system. So I think that there's a conflict of interest from their perspective to actually gain accountability. So I think that you would need to have some sort of very aggressive entity that enters SEC, Fenra, like these different oversight commissions and organizations that actually doesn't care about the conflict of interest and the potential harm that comes from moving through it and pursuing it that way. But there's so much conflict of interest in lobbying that I think would be really difficult. Yeah. Lauren says they weren't expecting GME to do what it did and they took care and who they took care of is very telling I agree with you fully agree with you. DCM says the buy button was turned off because of a massive fake trade that was immediately reversed and that's why the buy button was turned off the financial system wasn't going to collapse only some larger.

So to summarize the multiple dds we went through and just kind of at a high level what I'm seeing. I'm seeing a lot of really pervasive focus on manipulation which is fair. The various entities and the relationship between entities which I think is good. I see a lot of confirmation bias in trying to paint a specific picture that people want to see which is very normal. I see a lot of loosely formed opinions with respect to future price direction. Example being the the one that's talked about we are fucked and then the other one that talked about the TA on GameStop. Which is again that's not a dig at any of them. It's just people taking guesses and trying to piece together what they think is going to happen. I also see the overwhelming majority of what we've read did not happen at least in terms of price performance so far of GameStop.

But I think it's because people have a really negative connotation of meme stock and I don't think it's a negative connotation. I literally think based on the original definition when we started that series about meme stocks. It's literally stocks that are popularly talked about. And I don't think that that's a negative connotation at all. I think a lot of people apply a negative connotation that it's like some sort of like uninformed position or stuff like that, which I I would agree. Like I don't think that's at all. And I also don't think GameStop's price mover right now is just hype at all. I think GameStop has a completely viable underlying business and they're starting to pivot. So that's what I think.
