    "text": "Do you know the answer to this question up here? It is pretty simple. This is called put skew. And the reason why it exists is because market participants typically are willing to overpay for downside protection. Now, markets are pretty smart. So you can also find instances where there's call skew, but more often than not in general, you're gonna see put skew. And this is simply because in order for somebody to logically take the other side of that trade, where markets tend to take the elevator down, the stairs up, meaning there's velocity. And that's where your risk direction is, and it's unlimited compared to your profit potential, which is limited. It doesn't create a super great risk profile in general, and that's why there's a premium typically in puts. Again, it's not always the case, but more often than not, you'll see it that way. But once you get sensitive to this idea of skews, you can actually look for where markets are pricing in the direction of things. Be an all-air sealer.",
