    "text": "High probability trades does not mean profitable. This is a massively commonly misunderstood concept, specifically for option sellers. Let's take a look at an example. We have one here where we have a 95 chance of making 50 bucks. Then we have just a 5 chance of losing a thousand. This has a negative expected return. If you run the system over the long run, it will lose money. The whole point is, as a trader, you've got to abandon this hyper focus on profit potential and high probability of winning. And you have to focus way more on the expected return. It's the only way to survive in this business long term. The good feeling of a high win rate is literally meaningless if it means you lose money. Focus on making money. Been all our sailor.",
