I mean it has some commonality with 2008 but it's not the same thing um this is a regional retail bank as opposed to an International Investment Bank it's a different Beast um also Dodd-Frank is in place now I know they weakened it because this clown in charge of SBB was part of the lobbying group who tried to get it weakened good job there um but regulations are there for a reason and after 2008 back when there was some sort of bipartisan consensus where we could get something done people actually looked into what the problems were and addressed some of them so I don't think we're going to see the same contagion and I'm only saying that not because I know anything sure just because of the regulations in place it doesn't seem like that is going to be the same sort of situation and we're also this isn't driven by sort of a collapse of a retail Market and exacerbated by a whole bunch of you know credit derivative swap derivatives right it's really a very old-fashioned issue as far as",
