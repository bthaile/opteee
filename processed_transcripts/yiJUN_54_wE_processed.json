We're going to talk about a course that he's launching up coming pretty soon here. But before we start diving into all of that, you and welcome back yet again. I convinced you slash trick you to come on again. I suppose, but it's awesome to have you on. Thank you for joining us. Yeah. Thanks. It's great for me. It's probably not as good for you. You really should have more friends, I guess. Yeah. Well, the problem is as soon as I start talking to people about options, their eyes promptly roll to the back of their head and then they fall asleep. So it is a small cohort of people who find any interest in these products. So yeah, I'm fortunate that you are one of those people. But with all that, before we get into this stuff on the course, I do want to talk just a little bit about the broader markets as per usual, because I think there's a lot of really interesting things going on. And I know that you have a different view on a lot of those things. So one of the things I want to talk about specifically is SVB, obviously, just a really interesting case. And at least for me, this is the second time I've seen this kind of scenario. The first time",

And at least for me, this is the second time I've seen this kind of scenario. The first time was back in 2008. And that was like my second year trading. So I had a very different eye on it. I wasn't trading around those events in 2008 too much, whereas what's been going on SVB at least as far as I've been able to decipher, I've been trading a lot around it. So I'm curious from a just structural standpoint, what do you think of the bank failure? What jumps to your mind? I think it's okay. First of all, I don't think any of us should be thinking about this shit because we don't know enough about it to make informed decisions that are better than the market. We just don't, because if you think about it, it's going to be like, well, sooner or later we'll find out what really happened. So we were really, if you're honest with yourself, you don't know really what happened. You're waiting for someone like Lewis or whoever to write the book. And it's really dangerous to look at stuff from the outside. I mean, seriously, what do we know? We've read the newspaper. I haven't even done that.

I mean, it has some commonality with 2008, but it's not the same thing. This is a regional retail bank as opposed to an international investment bank. It's a different beast. Also, Dodd Frank is in place now. I know they weakened it because this clown and charge of SBB was part of the lobbying group who tried to get it weakened. Good job there. But regulations are there for a reason. And after 2008, back when there was some sort of bipartisan consensus where we could get something done, people actually looked into what the problems were and addressed some of them. So I don't think we're going to see the same contagion. And I'm only saying that not because I know anything, just because of the regulations in place. It doesn't seem like that is going to be the same sort of situation. And we're also, this isn't driven by sort of a collapse in a retail market and exacerbated by a whole bunch of, you know, credit derivative swap derivatives.

I think it's always dangerous to attach too much significance to how this is similar to a previous event. One of the real problems with being long-vol, being long-volved, everything is different all the time because you're never going to fight the same war twice. So are there commonalities sure, but I think we have to be cautious about what we really know. Even from a statistic standpoint, right? Even if this is exactly the same as 2008. What's your sample size? Why? Right. So good luck drawing inferences from that. The markets are hard enough to draw inferences from when you've got hundreds of data points. So having said that, I did take money out of bank accounts if it was above the FDIC limit and stuck them into safer places like bookmaker.eu and bet online and draft kings. I think for the short term, they legitimately had less risk than a bank. So that was the only thing I did as any result of this stuff. Oh, that's interesting.

I don't want to say technically, but yeah, you know, how they moved around and what their volatility was. What the implied vol was, it wasn't based on any particular view ahead.

So yeah, I don't know. I can come up with some tortured analogy, but I really just care what happened rather than why it happened. And to be honest, I'm almost always long the financials anyway. They typically trade very cheap in terms of the bulk premium. I'm talking about the big financials like, you know, JP Morgan, American Express, that kind of stuff.

There's like the tradable stuff and then there's stuff that I just find interesting. And it sounds like you really wait the tradable practical side of things. Is there like a general interest that you have in like what happens in the market or what happens in the economy? And if so, like, what does that look like for you? I don't care about it. Yeah, figured. I mean, it's not that I don't care about it so much as I find it ridiculously uninteresting. Like I've never read the Wall Street Journal or the financial times. I couldn't care less. I mean, I'm much more interested in the, well, the sort of stats-based stuff, the gambling based stuff. Yeah. I come that up from that point of view. I mean, to me, this is no different from putting that on women's cricket. You know, it's, although actually it is a little bit different, it's like quite like watching women's cricket as opposed to business.

But I actually really respect the way that you view the markets also because I do think for a lot of people, they start diving into causation causality.

That actually leads me to a following question is you were explaining some of your interest in sports. Obviously, you like sports. Why do you trade the markets then as compared to sports? Is it scale? Is it accessibility? Like what? Yeah, what leads you to that versus trading or gambling around things that you find more interesting? When I first started, there was no sports gambling in the companies I lived in. There wasn't in the US outside Vegas either. Unless, you know, there was no market, you'd say. And I got a job in the financial markets, basically. That's how I started there. I still do sports, but not to the extent I have done from the past. It takes a lot of work. It's a huge amount of work. And I think it's harder than trading. That was my following question. Why is that trading? There are a lot of pretty clear risk premium that you can jump on.

    "text": "was my following question. Why is that trading? There are a lot of pretty clear risk premium that you can jump on. Like stocks go up. There you go. You've got a tide. You've got 8 a year to play with. Options are too expensive. So there you go. That gives you a head start. And also the transaction costs and trading are minimal compared to gambling. I was just doing some golf gambling a while ago. And the markets are like, you know, 1.15 on each side. That's a huge spring. If that was a financial market, it would be like 101 on each side. You know, the spread in the spiders, for example, is practically speaking zero. And that's a big difference. Right. Yeah. That makes sense. It's, in part of the reason why I ask is, I mean, I don't bet on sports at all. I don't really watch sports. I like to play them. But I do find it really interesting. I like martial arts. And I see I don't know if you bet on any of that stuff. But I mean, they're coming up with insane bets, like whether or not these dudes will touch clubs, whether or not they'll sit down in between like it's that I find just so cool that they find all of these different things to bet on. But does that lead to more or less opportunity in sports betting? Because then to me, it also means that there would",

Or again, I don't know how many of it works, but I find it interesting. A lot of those kind of bets are just complete sucker bets. Yeah. Like literally, you can bet on the coin toss at the Super Bowl, which is like absolutely insane, particularly because you know, it's a 50-50 bet. But the odds that are paying you are terrible. If you just want a 50-50 bet, you know, go and play roulette. You know, the odds there are a lot better. So I don't remember the question there. Most of that stuff is just complete garbage and any a pros not going to touch that. Prok bets on like, will this player run for more than this many yards? That's a lot of pros bread and butter because those lines can be really soft because the bookies put up hundreds of them. And it's like being a market maker in a way.

But that's what I'm curious if you looked at it because I know your stuff's obviously way more advanced than mine. I'm not showing, but it might just be the same as any other shop. You know, because like a garch model is basically a vol model that has relaxation built into it. And for a given stop, the relaxation times are relatively constant no matter what the stop, what the shop was driven by. I don't know that, but in this case, but I do know that as a general phenomenon, that's why garch models work so well is because they are relatively stable like that. Interesting. I had not thought about that. That's interesting. So another thing I wanted to talk to you about, again, this is, I know slightly outside of your preferred topics, but I am curious about your input nonetheless. I do find following the fed's thought process. Interesting. Again, this isn't to forecast what the fed's going to do. This isn't to forecast what the market's going to do in reaction to the fed. It's literally just the function of the fed I find curious. And I've been really surprised with the way that they've kind of jumped around based on these data points, you know, that we got from the bank failure, then from some of the numbers that came out today.

No, it's really cool because I have a follow on anyways to the target. So at a high level overview, what are we expecting them to learn over the course? It sounds like there's going to be a little bit of, and I look through the coursework and thank you for sending it ahead of time. So I had a chance to get some familiarity and there's good intro to option stuff in there to help build that baseline, things about the Greeks, so on and so forth. So kind of like building a foundation, then you guys start getting into some other things. But I'd be curious to hear your summation of, you know, before you take this course, you're starting at x point and it seems like that point can be just about anything, maybe a general familiarity with markets and options.

I don't try and a lot of times with books, people say the same thing four times. I don't. It's very dense. I say it once. You might have to read it four times, but my stuff tends to be very dense. So there are, I think 300 slides in this. And there's a lot of information in there. So we have to start with the mechanics of options, because we can't really talk about a lot of the, where the edges are coming from unless you understand that. So that's where the big problem with theta is. As people think theta is an edge. It absolutely isn't. And if I could get people to understand one thing about options, that would be it.

So I often say it's kind of like being a hunter. Except you don't have to get up early in the morning. Actually, you do. Right? Being an option trader is very much like being a hunter. But the thing you have to understand is you have to understand the characteristics of what you're trading. It's not the math that's important. You know, a hunter isn't a biologist, but they have to know the characteristics of this is where ducks are. If this kind of food is around, you're more likely to find a duck. If this kind of water is around, you're not going to find ducks because they're not going to be in a rapid situation or a waterfall or something. And it's like that would volatility. You kind of have to know how it all behaves. And then once you've got that foundation, then we can look at specific trades like time-based trades, like selling options overnight, selling them over the weekend, trading equity earnings, some longer dated stuff like cover calls, risk reversals, zero DTE stuff we go into.

This is the actual way you have to make the decisions to trade there. So I tell you Volts over PRIST. Now what do you do? Which options do you sell? When do you rebalance them? What do you do if this happens? What do you do if that happens? What do you stop from blowing up? All these kind of it takes it from a theoretical high level thing to this is exactly what you do to have to do this trade. So I think that's the big difference because James is completely a trader.

Obviously, there were marketing guys involved and they didn't want to say 1,000. And for that, you get it's meant to be 12, one and a half hour lessons, but it's going to be more than that.

So the first thing is, do you guys have like a course syllabus or something that you're going to publish so people can look through that before they choose to buy the course so that they can have an idea of what's in there? A little bit. I can send you our sort of sales cheat sheet, which has like literally a bullet point course list. Sure. What people can also do though is they can sign up, see the first class, and if they don't like it, they can just cancel at that point. So it's not so much what we teach you. It's more like the style of how we teach it. If you think that's going to work for you, that's fine. If not, that's cool. You know, you can watch the first one and then just quit. That's probably the easiest way to sort of get an idea of what's going on. It's going to be a VIX trade. So it's not going to be options at all, but it's a good sort of example for a lot of other things we're going to get to. Right. So that leads then to a follow-on question. So one of the things that I notice in a lot of your books is there's obviously a good deal of theory that then attempts to bridge the gap to practical application. In the course, can people expect",

So one of the things that I notice in a lot of your books is there's obviously a good deal of theory that then attempts to bridge the gap to practical application. In the course, can people expect to see practical application of these different theories that you guys are going to be talking about, i.e. not just back tests, and these are the results of that. But as in, this is a trade that I did at xpoint, and this is how it went like that kind of stuff. Some of them, one of the problems with options is that the trades play out over much longer periods than that typically would be used. But yeah, we certainly have some real examples in there. And we do talk people through, these are the actual decisions you will need to make if you do this trade. So a lot of the actual strategies I mentioned in my last book, you know, like the weekend effect. I think it's a paragraph, whereas the weekend effect in this, I think it's probably going to be about an hour and a half. So that's sort of one of the big differences. But we definitely do that. We've got about, I don't know, eight different strategies in there. And I can't promise that I do all of them at any given time because I have, at sometimes, I'm not allowed to trade",

The bigger problem is though, we don't actually have that much data. Because we're not trading options. We're trading implied volatility. And it doesn't move as quickly as stocks do. It goes into regimes and stays there. So it's really dangerous to, you might think if you test something over the last four years, you've got a thousand data points. In volatility terms, you might only have 10. Right. And it's really difficult. It's easy to fool yourself into making an inference from that that really isn't there.

And also, are they recorded if somebody misses it? It's definitely recorded. And obviously, if you watch the recordings, we had people from Europe ask about this. And so for Europe, it's much more of a big deal because people aren't going to get up at two o'clock in the morning. It's all recorded. And if you need to ask questions, which you can't do live, you can do it through DMing me through the Slack. So that's true. We haven't talked about the idea of diving in and out of the course. I'm not sure that would be workable. But like I said, we do have this first free class thing. Sure. Yeah. That makes total sense. And then another thing you mentioned earlier was the duration of the course. But then before we started recording, you were talking about kind of the your thought process on the duration of like the Slack channel and the interactions. Can you talk about that real quick and just clarify that? Because I think it's an important point for people. Yeah. I intend the Slack channel the last forever unless you know, Slack goes away or you know, something genuinely unforeseen happens. I still get emails a couple of times a year asking if my old Slack channel is still around. And I don't",

And I think that that's actually a big sales point for people in case they didn't know the the fact that you know, you get the course, you get the interactions, but then there's also a sustained interaction period post, you know, when the when the sessions are over, which I think is useful. Yeah. And I'm going to keep that closed because you know, it's people are paid for the course. That's the access they're buying if you like. Yeah. Cool. And then the the last question I got from some of my folks is, is there like a resource library or what kind of is there any documentation they can expect to get?

Because you're putting yourself out there as some sort of expert. So I really think this is the best course of its kind. And I think that's partly because it's written by two traders who really genuinely trade, but also understand the theory. We understand the problems you'll fall into. But we've just put a lot of work into it. I think if there was something better, I think we would have tried to write that. Like I think genuinely this is as good as can be done for what we're trying to teach. And I've told a lot of this stuff to trading firms and things. So I kind of know what's useful and what isn't. I think I can do it all the time, but I can write the slides on it. Well, I think one of the things in what I consider with a service like this anyways is people are getting to tap into kind of your collective experience in a very condensed focused manner, which that in and of itself is like pretty valuable, in my opinion. So I'm really stoked to see the course here. How it's going and stuff like that.

And with your books and whatnot, you really strike a good balance between theory and practical application. And when I was looking through the slides, I saw that same thing. And I think that that's really useful for people because they get to get a distilled version of theory from somebody who's already pre-filtered. This is the important theory from this is all of the theory. And then this is how to practically apply it. So yeah, I think that's right. That's what that needled.

    "text": "from my folks and whatnot, it's super helpful to get just an overview, right? Of the course, what to expect. When people, when people like sign up, do you have a link that you can share with me so I can throw it in the video description and stuff like that? Or what's the easiest process to get people signed up? We are meant to be coming up with a sign-up page. It's got, we haven't done it yet. It's like, it was meant to be done Monday. Things were going very, very slowly and then they started going very quickly. So the sign-up page isn't here. When I get it, I'll send it to you and you do whatever you need to do with it. And I would encourage people, even if they're not going to sign up, right? And I understand all the reasons why they might not. Even if they're not, I think tuning into the first lesson would be, I think people will learn from that. That can't hurt, right? Hour and a half of your time. Yeah, I think that's awesome. So I'm looking forward to it. And yeah, when I get all the links and stuff, I'll throw it in the notes below for people and then also throw it in our discord. But you and I always, honestly, a pleasure to chat, looking forward to catching up and seeing how the course is going. And yeah, we'll talk soon. Right. Thanks very much.",
