    "text": "What's up to all the outliers? Welcome. And if you're new to the channel, what's going on? My name's Eric and welcome to you as well. So today I want to talk about portfolio margin as well as margin. And I got a couple of questions about some best practices. So we'll talk about that as well at the end. So to kick us off, let's start with what is margin? Margin in a nutshell is leverage. It is your broker allowing you a little bit of fiscal freedom, essentially, to maybe trade more value, notional value of a product than you have in the account. Or it's when they're asking you to set aside potentially a smaller amount than otherwise required if it were a cash-secured position. So what I have here is actually a couple excerpts directly from the SEC. So we will go ahead and link to this in the video description below if you want to check out any of the articles I'm going to go over today. But you'll notice a few things. We have an initial margin, maintenance margin, and margin calls. Let's start with initial margin. This is essentially the amount of money that the broker asks you to have in the account up front to cover a position. And as you can see, very frequently it's up to 50 of the purchase price of a security. So this is right now we're talking about stock. We'll talk about options as well. But",

So this is right now we're talking about stock. We'll talk about options as well. But right now we're talking about stock. So if you want to buy 100 worth of stock, whatever it is, essentially the broker would ask you for 50 bucks. Then when we actually establish the position we have what's called maintenance margin. And there's something I want to highlight here. You'll see that for maintenance margin technically speaking, it says at least 25 of the total market value of securities in your margin account. So it means that your initial margin is going to be higher than the maintenance margin going forward. So this is just a broker protecting themselves essentially. The interesting part though is this part down here, which as many brokerage firms have higher maintenance requirements typically between 30 and 40. I typically see 30. So it's just important to note that all of the discussion that we have today is going to be specific to your broker because for regulation T, this is set by SEC and FINRA. However, your broker can be more strict. They can't be less strict. So most of them adhere to the 50 on initial where you'll see the variances on maintenance. All right, so let's talk about portfolio margin, the purpose",

So most of them adhere to the 50 on initial where you'll see the variances on maintenance. All right, so let's talk about portfolio margin, the purpose of this video. There's a big difference between portfolio margin and regulation T. Regulation T has already standing permutations that are ran to determine how much money you need to keep in your account at a given point in time. This applies to stock positions. This applies to options positions. And essentially, not all positions are treated as equals. And what I mean by that is, for example, your brokerage might look at an index product, let's call it spy, or Apple, they might look at them differently in terms of how much money they want you to set aside. So for example, more often than not, index products are going to be slightly less margined than none. And it's because there's a perceived lower amount of risk there. So when we're looking at portfolio margin, there's a couple of things that are happening here. The first one is this, and this is kind of an important highlight, is it's based on the, well, I mean across it out, that one, right? It's based on the overall portfolio risk, not each individual trade. Now, if your portfolio is concentrated into one product, then obviously it's still going to assess a",

Now, if your portfolio is concentrated into one product, then obviously it's still going to assess a higher risk there. Because one of the things your broker is including in their calculation is the overall perceived risk of your portfolio, part of that being how diversified you are. So notice how I say it's a proprietary account margining based on overall portfolio risk. The reason I say proprietary is because it's broker specific. Different brokers will have different computations on how they arrive at how much margin they want for a portfolio or for individual positions. So what I'm going to go over down here is for TD Ameritrade because that's who I use. So just make sure you check with your broker and what their requirements are. So when we look at portfolio margin accounts, a couple important notes. The first one is IRAs are not applicable. It has to be a standard margin account. It also requires a minimum amount of capital, typically 125,000 initials and then 100,000 maintenance. Again, check with your broker and many require a written test. It's super easy, but they require you to do it. For regulation T, you pretty much just need 2,000. But for portfolio margin because there's increased leverage, they're a little more strict.

For regulation T, you pretty much just need 2,000. But for portfolio margin because there's increased leverage, they're a little more strict. So rather than using those standard calculations that you see in regulation T, portfolio margin uses specific ranges for positions based on the product, as I was mentioning before. So they like right now TD Ameritrade using minus 15 positive 15 for stocks and option positions in minus 12 and plus 10 for large and small cap broad based indices. So notice that difference I was referencing before. And then they also goes into a little bit of detail on how they incorporate implied volatility calculation. So they use what's called sticky strike, sticky delta. Sticky strike is when there's a constant IV computation, sticky delta is when there's a slope involved. And essentially they run through their calculation and they decide how much they want you to have in the account. And notice this last note here, wider stress test parameters that result in a larger, larger requirement may be enforced at any time. Here's the deal. Margin is a luxury afforded to us. It gives us greater leverage, the ability to be more efficient in our portfolios. But this, their broker's not doing this out of the kindness of their heart.

But this, their broker's not doing this out of the kindness of their heart. They're doing it because it's a selling point. We want to be efficient. But at no point does that mean that the broker is not going to cover their risk? That is their job. So as soon as we see or the broker starts to calculate different volatility metrics and they see increased risk, you would better believe the larger requirements are going to increase. They're not going to cover your risk for you. All right. So a couple of things. This is the SEC site that I was talking about. I will link to this. This one is just a quick comparison of different amounts of capital required for different positions. This is again for TD Ameritrade. So when we're looking at stock, this is showing you that it's a long 100 shares of a random stock at 100. And it's showing you what the initial margin is, what the maintenance margin is, and then what the portfolio margin is. So this is assuming, again, we're a long 100 shares of stock that's valued at a hundred bucks. So we can see for initial, again, 50. We know that. So that's going to be 5,000.

And then for the portfolio margin is 31,896. So depending on the positions that you have on and depending on how diverse they are, you will see slight variance in what the requirements are as an entire portfolio is assessed. So the other thing I wanted to show you is this right here. This is what talks about their actual computations.
