    "text": "you you you where What's up, outliers, we have, I think, our final options trading for beginners session for today. So I am slightly, I don't know, like, I mean, we'll still do the live sessions on Friday, but I'm going to pivot away from like this specific focus necessarily on like a topic. It'll still be for beginners, but I'm going to leave it to be a little bit more open-ended. So the goal of this session for today is actually to walk through a path forward and to talk about three of the biggest mistakes that I see and hopefully the goal here would give you some ideas on how this trading journey will look like for you going forward. So I am very excited to get into this. I'm also very excited because I have a new self-inflating lumbar support thing so that I can apparently hopefully sit a little more comfortably looking forward to that. But as you know, we got to say hello to everybody. Let me grab this chat and let's get right in. So a few things right from the jump. As always, this is a live session. So feel free to jump in with anything that you want to cover. That is the entire goal. I'm going to get through some set material first and then we'll go more into like the open-ended side of things. But yeah, come with whatever you want to talk about. Alright, so the starting point for",

But yeah, come with whatever you want to talk about. Alright, so the starting point for the session today is three common beginner mistakes. And there's essentially an entire listicle series you can do off of this. You can do 10, 15, 20, 50. Like there's a bunch of trade-em mistakes. But the goal for this is to talk about it in kind of a broad sense. And the reason why I want to talk about it in a broad sense is because I think that by covering these broader topics, I think you will have some tools to then build out going forward that cover specifics. So as most of the stuff that I do, you're not going to get a lot of highly prescriptive things like never do blank. Because guess what? Like I've learned in my trading career that sometimes there is a time and reason to do whatever it is that you're never supposed to do. So I don't really speak in absolutes. So let's talk about where this begins. And it starts on this blank screen. But the first thing I actually want to start with before I bring up the first item that I think is a really common mistake is I want to ask you in the chat. So",

But the first thing I actually want to start with before I bring up the first item that I think is a really common mistake is I want to ask you in the chat. So if you were to summarize the top three biggest trading mistakes focused a little bit on options traders. Obviously, what would you guess they are? And you can throw one, two, or three. I want to give you a few seconds to think about that. And while you're answering, my guess is we are going to see a highly varied set of answers. And I want to highlight that the fact that I'm expecting a highly varied set of answers. Because if I don't see a highly varied set of answers, obviously, I'd be completely wrong. But my guess is that your answers are actually going to introduce my first point, which I'm excited for. So Rhys says for myself or all traders, whatever, it's up to you. Joey says probably a profit versus expectancy. That's a really interesting one. Roaring Titty is focusing on changing stops and not thinking about entries and exits. I like that. Brad says expiring too soon things that are out of the money. I think that's a good long song. He long song says not knowing how to roll covered calls. Another really good one.

So for those that are unfamiliar with like the military hierarchy crap. I just dropped my thing one second. I can grab that. I just scared the crap out of Thor because I dropped my little tablet when I was trying to grab it. And Thor was just like, yo, I am not here for that. He's literally sitting at like a alert right now. All right. We had to make sure that the homie was good. So for those that don't know, the military kind of thinks about different layers and levels very specifically with respect to how we organize stuff. So when we talk about trading, a lot of what I do is adaptations of what I've learned in the military. So one of the things here is we have strategic level. Then we have operational. And then we have tactical. So I'm not here to teach you about military history and orders, process, and stuff like that. This is all going to be trading focused.

Something like changing stops bad entries exits, I would bucket that here. Something like buying options that expire too soon like Brad's talking about, I would bucket that here. Something like not knowing how to roll covered calls very specific. That's very tactical. Taking profits early, which is kind of a dovetail off of Joey, I would probably bucket that here. That Lauren says for getting to look at theta, I would bucket that here. Ricky says taking profits early doesn't seem like a big issue better than watching your trade go red.

Right. The idea of take a smaller profit rather than let your trade run red. Right. That sounds not greedy. It sounds like you're doing the right things, but it's actually not enlightened at all. Unfortunately. So Ricky, it's a completely reasonable thing to say. I would have said the same thing. Like there's absolutely nothing wrong with that as a theory. The problem is it's a perverted theory that people don't fully understand. So we'll talk about that in a little bit, but ear market. Because what you brought up is completely fair and it's so common. And I want to make sure we talk about that specifically, but absolutely fantastic point. Vladimir says I close some calls. Reese says Eric might disagree. One of the biggest things I've learned from him. Yeah, exactly. Reese's spot on. I do disagree. Cedric says looking at macro economic events.

Everybody shout out to Roing Titty. One of the greatest names on earth says, oh, triggered. Cedric says, I am of the belief most money is lost, not in a recession, but preventing one. It's the same with taking profit, taking on trading. That confuses me a little bit. I think we'll talk about it a little bit, but the idea about profit taking is not most people, I notice, especially when I'll take a position on something, they'll generally think that if I disagree with a position that then I inherently mean the inverse, which is actually very rarely the case. But I think something like profit taking the way I would bucket it broadly is that it's very, very nuanced, which we'll talk about. And Mike says, hey, fellas, Mike, it's fellas and ladies to you. I would I will happily let you know, hold on, let me check my YouTube analytics right now. I am overflowing with female audience members. It's like, it's incredible how many, what's your guess?

It's like, it's incredible how many, what's your guess? If you were to speculate how many male versus female as a percentage, what's the percentage you would guess here? I'm going to start a poll. What percentage of Eric's audience is male? Less than 10, we'll do 25 to make it faster, less than 25, 25 to 50. Then we'll do like 50 to 75. Okay, so most, all right, well, I realized that the poll is, you guys are all way closer than I was expecting. I thought I might have misled you well enough. So I actually need to reconfigure my poll because apparently I didn't trick anybody. So we'll do like 80. I think there's actually enough responses in here. I can probably just guess. So I see 80, 99, 93, I see Lauren raising her hand, offering herself as the notification that there is a female. Lauren Titty is letting us know that there is a second female with us. So yeah, fun fact, it is 94.4 male, 5.7 female. And then it looks like the bulk for Brad says under 35, fascinating enough, it's not. So under 35 is 27.4 at 25 to 34. And then 4 18 to 24. So the bulk of my people, this is actually news to me, the bulk of my people are 35 to 44,",

So yeah, I mean, one of my favorite things to do, I'm not even kidding is when I go places like physical therapy and whatnot and like you're filling out the forms, I literally will fuck around and I'll say that, oh, I'm obviously a female.

I think it calls it not necessarily non-binary, but Joey says Eric is going to get Estrogen by accident one day. That would be hilarious because actually if you get some Estrogen, it can actually spike testosterone because testosterone starts to counteract the excess Estrogen. So maybe that's the way to do it. Roaring Titty says Native Americans recognize several genders as well. Yeah, definitely. Well, I think the problem is, well, I don't want to get into that debate.

But I just come from like, just treat everybody with respect as long as there's mutual respect. I don't give a fuck. That's how I feel. So back to trading though, a lot of the things that you all highlighted in my opinion fall in this bucket, the very, very tactical level bucket. And that's okay. This actually is in line with what I would expect a newer trader to think they should be focusing on is the very tactical level of things. Now, if you know anything about me or the content that I produce, you're probably going to be a little upset for this video about three common beginner mistakes because we're actually going to spend all of the time up here. And here's why. If you get the strategic and operational components of trading down, literally, the tactical level of trading will straight up take care of itself. It will take care of itself. And I know that sounds weird esoteric, but it's really not. It really is not. And you'll see why. So the goal here is to try and offer a way",

Cedric says strategic guess, valuing a company, even higher level than that. So in a trading way, well, it kind of like in a trading language, the way that I think about the strategic level, that was a fun squeal line, the way I think about the strategic level is like we're literally talking about things like philosophy. We're talking about self-awareness. We're talking about habits and dependencies. So at this strategic level, we're talking about literally what governs everything else we do. At the operational level is how we trade. What's our approach? What do we think we do? That's operational level. What's the broad mandates that we follow? Tactical level is the execution of the skill set. So let's now take a look at what Eric seems to believe these three mistakes are. We'll start with the very first one, lack of structure. Does this surprise you in the least that I would call this out? Like to me, as I think about the very first mistake, every single option trader makes, myself included, is a complete and utter lack of structure. 100. So for example, I",

Like to me, as I think about the very first mistake, every single option trader makes, myself included, is a complete and utter lack of structure. 100. So for example, I have another question for the chat. If you were to tell somebody, these are the first three things you need to learn in order to be an options trader. What are those things? What would you tell them? And I'll give you a few moments to throw it in the chat. You can list one, two, or three, whatever you want. But I want to know from each person that's willing to participate, what are three, what are the three things you would tell somebody that says, hey, I want to be an options trader. What are the first three things I should do? What are those? And again, what I'm going to highlight is something that I don't think most people consider. So so far, Cedric says, understand the mechanics of options and why they are used completely fair. I think that that's very reasonable. Joe says risk management also completely reasonable. Elon's song says, block some time to learn, gotta create a space in order to pick up the skill set makes a ton of sense. Off Putin says paper trade first. I also think that that's a fair answer.

Paulo says learn technical analysis. You got to figure out what you want to trade. That Lauren says learn the Greeks. We need to know how options behave. I'd rather be skiing says risk slash money management. So we've seen that one, the very first one twice now. That's the only thing we've seen twice so far. Create a plan system, create rules to follow that plan and never deviate. Let's talk about that one just a little bit in a second. Joey says purpose and portfolio fit. Gotta know what we're trying to do with our money. So let's Brad says learn to control your emotions. Huge one. We're actually going to talk about that one. So let's go to I'd rather be skiing's comment specifically the create rules to follow that plan and never deviate. So if I were let's let's say a jujitsu player and let's say that I'm a white belt. I'm brand and I actually technically I'm a white belt because I've been a jujitsu dude my whole life essentially for like 15 years but I've been in a gee like four times.",

Is it fair for me to say to a white belt. Create your own approach to jujitsu and never deviate from it. Make your own and never deviate from it. Do we think that that's reasonable for me to tell a brand new jujitsu player? No, doesn't make sense does it? But we say all the time in trading. We say it all the time in trading. We tell new traders make a plan and never deviate because it sounds good. It makes sense. But guess what?

But it's like non-traditional. That's why I make the joke. It's like in a traditional sense, I literally have been in a kimono like literally less than a handful of times. So in a traditional sense, I am absolutely a white belt. But yeah, I mean, I've been grappling the vast majority of my adult life. It's actually super fun too. Like I said, it's always hilarious to me. Like if I'm traveling somewhere and I go to a new gym and they're like, what level are you? Again, I can say with a clean soul. Like I am a white belt. But that's not my skill level. I don't think. But it's my technical level. So pretty fun. So anyways, in this context back to trading, as you guys could tell, right?

So Brad is starting with the alphabet. What are the letters? What are the symbols we use to represent noise? And then other folks like Vialobo, Paulo, Vladimir, I'd rather be skiing. They're going with more the practical approach. Right? So those are like two giant differences between the methodology that we literally just summarized if somebody was to start to learn English. We have the structural approach. Alphabet. And then Joey used like specific words or phrases. And then there's kind of a more experiential approach. This is more go watch a movie with subtitles. This is talk with kids. As you're you know outplaying with them or whatever. If we look at this, there's two kind of general approaches here, but what's common behind all of this? The main commonality I see is we're starting with basics. However, we get to those basics, but we start with basics. Okay. So now why am I going through this example with you?

Is because I'm trying to highlight a completely different model that we apply in trading. So one more example and then I promise I'll tie it in. If I were trying to teach somebody math. Right? Let's say that they're new to math. What are some of the beginning ways that I would teach them math? I would probably start with things like derivatives or maybe I'll start with like proofs. Now obviously not. I would start with numbers. I would start with addition, subtraction. Maybe, maybe hit them over the head with some pendoz. Maybe then move them to algebra. So, notice is taxes. That's the last thing I would teach somebody that's new to math because I wouldn't want them to quit on life before they even started. I feel like that would just be absolutely absolutely brutal. Absolutely brutal. So when we look at the learning process though for something like math, what I'm highlighting is regardless of your background with math, there's a general approach you would take. You would start with some basic shit. You would then start with some less basic shit. Then you would go to some moderate shit, then some like medium moderate shit.

This happens with exams. This happens with quizzes. This happens with projects. Yes, I actually had fucking math projects. You want to talk about a demoralizing event. Do a math project. So when we look at the process of learning math or really anything else, it's a very building block approach because exactly to Brad's point, still got to learn numbers. He's 100 correct. It's the same thing when we're talking about learning English. If you're going to learn English to be able to speak, read and write, you still have to know the fucking alphabet. So there's basic things that you learn. Yet, if I go back up to what you guys told me, you would tell a brand new options trader they should start with. I saw things like risk management, which is good. There's nothing wrong with that. But that's pretty specific. I saw something about probability of profit versus expectancy.

So if we're talking about first steps, there is stuff like learn technical analysis. Shit. What is technical analysis? If I'm a new options trader, what the fuck does that even mean? So what I'm highlighting and hopefully delivering together with a bow is that the first step for a new option trader is to build a fucking structure to learn because you are in the wild west. There's nobody out there telling you what to do. There's nobody out there that's quizzing you on what you've learned. There's nobody out there giving you practice fucking problems. It is you, the individual. It is all you. So the whole point here, and this is again, why I built this exact thing for us. And this isn't even what I would consider to be like the ultimate end state. This is just something to offer somebody so that you have something because I recognize that there's a giant gap for this that people want to start talking about things like probability of profit versus expectancy, which is a really important lesson. But should that happen before compounding interest is well understood?

I would guess because you know how that goes. Sometimes those kind of math problems can be like really, really specific. The point is is even people that are really well seasoned traders. My guess is if you go through these starting modules like this, you'll probably find a bunch of shit that you don't know. Probably. So even though we're trying to operate down here on using intraday gax in zero DTE SPX options to inform entry periods, we might not know some of the fundamental concepts that govern literally the process of trading or learning. Notice how the humor of all of this is and I will continue to reiterate this point because I think it's very important is that the question I say is most common option trader mistakes. I haven't even mentioned the fucking word options yet. I haven't even said the word because it doesn't matter. It options themselves are just vehicles. We have to get a lot of other things solidified first before we even think about options which leads us to the next common mistake.

Maybe they've studied options for a few months or a few years and they're like, well, let me, this is going to be my strategy because I'm supposed to make a plan that I never deviate from. So my plan is going to be to buy seven day options that are out of 15 delta because they're really cheap and it controls my risk. That's what I'm supposed to do. That's another thing that we covered that is super important is risk management. So if I buy these call options, then I'm controlling my risk from the jump and then I'm going to exit the trade every single time. It's up two dollars because the other thing I was taught is that I'm supposed to manage my winning trades because I can't let a winning trade turn into a losing trade.

They're focusing on the entire wrong stuff. It doesn't even matter yet. And that's why I try to highlight, I'm calling it the big four trade process because in my opinion, these are the big four steps that have to happen if you want to be a successful trader. Every single trade, these four steps have to happen. So before I determine if I want to sell a 30 DTE option, 10 DTE option, five delta, or if I want to buy the 15 delta, none of that matters. If I don't have a completely clear line of sight on what the profit mechanism is, what is it that I'm making money from? The second step is to create a signal. We need to measure the profit mechanism as it sits. We need to know when the profit mechanism exists. And we need to understand the qualities of the profit, the profit mechanism. So that leads us to our next spot. And",

And we need to understand the qualities of the profit, the profit mechanism. So that leads us to our next spot. And what do you notice so far? This is again a video about option trader mistakes. What's the, what's what do you notice? I still haven't even said the word options. I got through the first mistake with not using the word options. It's in there because you do need to learn about options once you develop structure, but the mistake of lacking structure is nothing to do with options. The next thing broke trade foundation. The first things as part of the big four trade process is not about options at all. Literally at all. You don't get to even worry about options until you get here. That's all there is to it because here's why. If I'm worried about if I'm going to buy a 30 delta call or buy a 20 delta call, that's what I care about. What happens if the underlying goes down? If I buy a 30 delta call or if I buy the 10 delta call, 15 delta call, what happens? Underline goes down. Any guesses? Lose money. That's exactly correct. Reese is 100 correct. You fucking lose money. And Joey adds a little color around it, which is important. You lose money depending",

I understand that if something crosses below a 50 day moving average on average for this specific product, it'll fall to a maximum of x percent before after certain amount of days. It rallies back up above it. That's all simple research to do. And once that's done, then I can either sell the put or buy a call. It doesn't matter. I'm going to make money either away. So then I can say, OK, I can fairly reliably identify this profit mechanism as it sits. I understand when it happens because I've tested different signals. I understand the behavior of the profit mechanism. Then I can figure out what structures generally fit with the profit mechanism. Again, something goes up short call. I'm sorry short put long call either or totally fine. And then I can build strategies about those structures that let me maximize things.

If I'm bullish in here, the next part of what I need to do is say how bullish in what time frame? Do I think that this is going to skyrocket from 211 to 225? Maybe, maybe I do, maybe I don't. It depends on the individual trader. But what I'm going to tell you is that if I think it's going to go from 211 to 225 in the next week, I'm going to put on a different trade than if I think it might take a month to get from 211 to 225. Or maybe I think it might catch up to this high in here and then stall out. That's still up. I can still make money on it going up. But instead of buying a ratio called diagonal, maybe I sell puts. Maybe that complements the portfolio better. But the point is we have to clearly identify what it is we're trying to trade and then we have to study it so that we understand how it behaves.

If I look at this and I'm like, yeah, okay, based on my research and what I think is possible, maybe using prior reference moves like here, it consolidated for a while, started marching up and out. Maybe I'll give it another couple days because based on again, my breath of experience, learning, technical analysis and studying signals, then I'll take a look at, give it another day, see if it continues the rally. And if it does, then I favor a breakout move to the upside, potentially. Okay. Well, if I do that, then I would not want to sell puts. I would rather buy calls of some sort. Then I have to go through the rest of my trade process to see that it lines up. But this goes back to this. I cannot overemphasize this point enough. I think between these first two, this is probably the downfall of the overwhelming majority of traders.

    "text": "the downfall of the overwhelming majority of traders. I genuinely, we feel comfortable saying that you guys know, hopefully, that I don't like giving bad statistics. I don't like saying numbers that aren't based on something. So this is, I'm postulating here. But I would feel pretty confident in that as a measure. Like I think that's probably pretty damn close, as my guess. So I'm going to take a pause on the first two, most option, most common option trader mistakes. Anything jump out at you here? Because there's something that jumps out at me compared to your answers from the beginning of the session. It shows me at the beginning of the session, most of you are here looking at individual strategy level decisions. We're talking about the ways that we manage individual trades. But from my perspective, I think this accounts for the vast majority of options traders that don't succeed. Because again, what I can tell you is that if you are good at finding specific profit mechanisms and you're good at measuring, creating signals, understanding the characteristics, your probability for failure becomes minute. As long as you maintain good overall trade hygiene, things like managing risk, as you guys point out, that's massive. You have to manage risk, have to manage risk. But you can manage risk perfectly and still fail. If we can't find things that are doing what we think it may or may not do, and then building stuff around it, first",

That's your first action item. Now, I would highly encourage you, you don't have to do this, but I would highly encourage you to pop into the Discord and share. Share what you think you're going to focus on. We literally have a beginner's, we have an entire beginner's channel, and it's free for everybody that's in the free area. It's, everybody can access it. It's completely free. You can join. And then you can figure out if what you're focusing on makes sense. But guess what, even if you don't want to join the Discord and do that, I'm completely agnostic. I honestly don't carry their way. You can go to my website, because I literally built it for you.

Re says not to sound defensive, but you ask an options question to the answer did involve options. No argument at all, though. Yeah, definitely that's the point, though, right? Is the whole point of asking it in the context of option traders is because option traders forget this shit because they're not thinking about it. That's exactly the purpose of that question is because option traders become too focused on options. And they put the cart so far in front of the horse that you can't even see the fucking cart. So yeah, completely agree with you. That Lauren says, what exactly do you mean by learning road map? You tell me, what do you think that that means? It's a great question, by the way. But I'm very curious what that means to you. And if anybody else has any ideas on what they think a learning road map might be, what feel free to chime in, I'm going to try my super cool back pillow thing.

So Cedric is on it. So this is a road map. And then again, you can get this on the website. And then what I do actually is at the bottom, you can take a look at a more in depth syllabus. So what I do is I give you a starting point. Again, this is not the whole answer in my opinion. This is literally a starting point. And the reason why I give this as a starting areas because I do think you need to take the time and figure out what holes you need to plug, right? Because maybe you already understand compound interest. Okay, cool. Then you don't really have to spend a lot of time on that. But my guess is if you for the next three months decided, okay, month one, I'm going to start with module one. And again, I'm just using this as a framework. You can make your own.

So you should be able to look at something like this and have solutions for all of them mentally. Whether or not you want to take notes in a trading plan, entirely up to you, I do, but totally up to you. But like, for example, setting financial goals, I guarantee you, if I walked all of you through what I do, the people that are in the mentoring program on the Patreon, I guarantee you, if I walked all of you through that, you would have completely, completely insufficient financial goals, completely insufficient. And that's not to dig it anybody. But it's just because it's something that we don't think about. We just kind of start moving and we forget that we have to think about this. And some people, they're financial, they think they have financial goals. But then you ask them, what are the financial goals? Oh, I want to be financially free by the time I'm 40.",

Okay, cool. What's enough? How much is enough? Well, I don't need that much. Okay, well, that's what you're saying right now. What if you have a kid? What if you have another kid? What if you decide by the time you're 40, you want to enjoy life a little bit more and you don't want to eat ramen every day? Consider that. Right? So the point is, we as traders want to get so far ahead of ourselves down to this shit that we completely foresaic completing the basics of setting up an absolute rock solid foundation for what we were trying to do. So again, that's my guess is that if we went through this in depth, this idea of setting financial goals, my guess is just about every single person in here would have underdeveloped financial goals. And that's not a dig. Hopefully, it's a shot across the bow that it's something you probably need to think about. Probably because again, I've done a bunch of these mentoring sessions at this point and it is universal across everybody. So if that's",

Probably because again, I've done a bunch of these mentoring sessions at this point and it is universal across everybody. So if that's the case, it's probably generally applicable to a much larger, larger sample. Same thing here, risk profiles and tolerance. Let's do a hypothetical for the chat. What's your risk tolerance? Just whatever that means to you, what is your risk tolerance? And I guarantee you, for those that answer, there's going to be a common theme. I already know there's going to be a common theme. Vladimir says, hi, he says 1 drawdown, Sam Cleman says extreme. Roy Titty says not good enough. Cedric says if I know the value of a company, Elon Song says medium, Reese says depends on conviction. So what do you guys notice about essentially all of these answers? Paul says 1 drawdown. I'd rather be seeing says a percentage of the portfolio based on risk reward of a trade. Cedric is on it. These aren't numbers. If we're talking about risk tolerance, whether we think about risk tolerance as a function of total portfolio risk, what you put on an individual trade again, it's an open ended question by design. But there were two people that even loosely defined it. And the other thing I can tell you is that for the people that",

But there were two people that even loosely defined it. And the other thing I can tell you is that for the people that save 1 drawdown of portfolio, that's essentially impossible to trade. Like if you think about a 1 drawdown on the portfolio, that's almost impossible to achieve even in the best returning assets. So for the people that quantify it, that's still insufficient because if we rationally think about 1 of the portfolio risk, we would be overutilized as soon as we do anything. So when I think about something risk tolerance, this is again why setting financial goals is so important. And why having this in order is essential? Because how are we going to go down here and worry about options if we don't even reconcile with ourselves the way we think about risk and what we're okay with? How does that make sense? It doesn't. And the reason why it doesn't is because most traders skip this entire process of building structure, building a solid foundation. Again, the leading mistake, I see options traders make. And again, I don't say this from a whole year than vow perspective. I did this exact fucking thing. We all do it. I didn't do this in the beginning. I didn't think to do this. I didn't know to do this. But",

So this is again, a generalized starting point that I think new options traders can leverage for themselves. This is not comprehensive, but I think this is a good starting point. Then we look at we have our roadmap, we know what we're doing now, we know what we're focusing on. So now what's our next action item? I gave you your first action item.

And the reason is because most people, if I ask them, talk about a profit mechanism. It's such a broad question that a newer trader doesn't even know how to define that for themselves. So I'll help you. What are some basic profit mechanisms you can think of? You guys start, you guys tell me first, and then I'll give you some ideas. I'd rather be skiing says, what do you mean by profit mechanism? It's a great question. What do you guys think? So for a rather be skiing, that video is for you. And let's see. Reese says shares.

Brad is on it, but I'm waiting specifically for Roaring Tittie. Check out the chart for volume. Nope. This is exactly why I want to work through this example. I want to make sure that this is crystal clear. So Roaring Tittie, we have news comes out that provides a catalyst. Then you check the chart for volume or whatever and you see volume expanding.

And in the meantime, cheers. I got to take some aside of benefit. So in Roaring Tittie scenario, we have news. We have a catalyst. We have volume that's expanding. We have volume. We have faith in the titty. Let's take a look at this. Let's take a look at Nike. So Nike had a new CEO. That's news. Right. That's a catalyst.

It has something to do with the chart itself. And think about it. If you put in a dollar and the news breaks, does your dollar change? Doesn't. Roaring Tittie says support and resistance close. That's moving in the correct direction. The thing that makes you money is the stock moving. So let's use an alternate scenario. Let's say Nike announces a CEO. Let's say stock volume goes up, but it's highly constrained. Buyers and sellers are on top of one another. You have news. You have a catalyst. You have expanded volume. You might not actually make any money. Or you could have news. You could have catalyst. You could have an expense and volume. And it could go down. You could lose money. So what I'm trying to do is get all of you to think about the specific mechanism that leads to making money. And we'll go into a couple examples.

    "text": "the specific mechanism that leads to making money. And we'll go into a couple examples. Mel just got home so I had to make sure I let Thor run out and go run over to her. So first, let me take a pause there. Roaring Tittie. Does what I say makes sense? My guess is you're inherently thinking of that. Like I don't think I'm saying anything that's necessarily revolutionary. But hopefully the point that I'm driving home is the requirement to break things out and down into these requisite pieces. That's my goal. I'm hopeful that that's the point that you will take away. So when we think about a profit mechanism, it is how something functionally makes you money. So let's think about a few of them. We just covered one of them. So we have something that can have, let's do profit mechanism. First one, easy. Price direction up. Another one, price down. Another one, volatility up, down, the RP or relative. Roaring clitty says if something is trading sideways, you can make money selling options. You can. And the way that you do that is either through volatility or you can absolutely classify that if you would like. You can absolutely do. I'm value. Now your time value stuff will almost always have a volatility component, but you can absolutely break out something like theta decay. Cedric says yields. That's exactly correct. That's another very good one. This can be dividends. For anything. Stocks, ETFs, bonds,",

Cedric says yields. That's exactly correct. That's another very good one. This can be dividends. For anything. Stocks, ETFs, bonds, they have yields. So all of these are absolutely profit mechanisms. Now, Cedric says merger. Merger itself is not a profit mechanism. Because again, and this is why this point is so important is because mentally we conflate things. A merger can happen that doesn't do anything. The stock cannot move. That's not the actual mechanism. That's a signal. Same thing with roaring titty. If we think about signals, so literally just get rid of this and think of it this way. Profit. Mechanism. Signal. What you what you all are on to now. Captain Chris says, yo, I'm in public and everyone keeps hearing you say, titty. Yeah, man. Well, we have the titty in here. So I'm a say her name, loud and proud, so that everybody there around you knows that we have roaring titty in the house. It's actually essentially vital for our operation here to acknowledge titty. And I think everybody here has a strong affinity for titty as we should. So now, let's think about what, funny enough, titty. Let's think about what titty said. Share by back.

But here's Cedric says it's a change in demand. It is a change in demand. But again, a change in demand is not a profit mechanism. A change in demand is simply a change in demand. Demand can go up. Demand can go down. And if we don't see anything, then price doesn't inherently have to move. Same thing with like a merger arbitrage. Price isn't dictated to move in a merger arbitrage.

Joey says main is underlying movement. That's absolutely correct. So the primary profit factor here is going to be delta, the movement of the underlying completely correct. So the first profit mechanism is price movement up. The second profit mechanism is long theta and time is passed. The third profit mechanism, whether or not it happened, I'm not sure we could take a look, is if volatility changed. And in this case, volatility would have gone against us. So that wouldn't be a profit mechanism. And it doesn't surprise me. Let's use this as a great foundation for a hypothetical, not even a hypothetical practical question. Why is volatility expanding here? The stock price is going up. Normally, volatility contracts when stock price is going up. Look carefully at the chart because your answer is there. Why, oh, why is volatility? Brad says because the gap up with news, nope, that's not it. It's good news. So Joey says it went up more than expected, more volume. Nope, not at either.

    "text": "you probably wouldn't know that and that's okay. You're not supposed to know all of it upfront. You're not going to. But that's exactly why volatility was increasing is because we're getting closer to earnings. And again, as you surround yourself in options more, you will learn more things. And this is one of those things that we typically will see volatility, implied volatility expand leading into earnings starting about two weeks out. It's common behavior. I know it's going to happen more often than not. So, in fact, let's talk about profit mechanisms. Is there something there? Any ideas? What profit mechanism exists based on that phenomenon I just told you that I know implied volatility tends to expand about two weeks out leading into earnings. Longval, bingo. Reese is correct. 1 correct. So the way that we think about profit mechanisms is the specific thing, the specific thing that leads to making money. Now, what's the signal? Well, the signal in this case is knowing that earnings is coming up in a few weeks and volatility tends to expand into earnings. That's my signal. The profit mechanism itself is the movement of implied volatility. Roryntitty says longval, longvalu. Nope, it's long in this context, it's volatility. Most of the time when you hear people say vol, it refers to volatility. But sometimes it can mean volume, but that's less frequent. Normally, you'll see context dependent, but normally, you'll see it as volatility. Roryntitty says, if you take earnings",

Normally, you'll see context dependent, but normally, you'll see it as volatility. Roryntitty says, if you take earnings out of the equation completely, would the gap up not increase vol? Not necessarily no. It doesn't mean that it would or wouldn't. We can't really tell because there's other things at play. So, prime time example, it gapped up here, right? But I can tell you that 30-day vol went from 27, 7, 9, 6, 3 to after the gap, it went to 27, 6, 4. So, 30-day vol contracted. And then if I take a look at 7-day vol, it went from 25 to 23. So, this is an example of a gap up and vol went down. That's why it's not a discrete answer, right? And that's why I can tell you definitively that the behavior largely is going to be attributable to earnings. Does that mean that the gap up didn't have an effect or the news didn't have an effect? It absolutely could have. I can't decouple those entirely. But here's the other thing I can show you is that leading into this gap up, do you notice the slope of volatility? And again, it's these yellow lines. It's positive sloping. So, even before this news broke about Nike CEO being replaced, it already, even",

That's not an absolute, but it tends to contract. So, here, I see something that's going up, and I see volatility going up. That tells me something's up. Don't always know what right out of the gate, but something's going on. And in this case, I can clearly see a few things, but a big one of them is this earnings on the horizon. So, Cedric says I'm confused. What is difference between IV and volatility? There's no difference. They're different, different things related to the same thing. This video is for you. So, Cedric, that video is all about volatility. So, it's going to talk about all different kinds of volatility, implied historic forecast, realized, future realized, it'll break down, vol entirely.

Changes in implied volatility certainly would be a profit mechanism. So, you'll notice here, in the profit mechanisms, I literally already had those written out for you, right? Volatility up down, relative volatility plays. This is not a comprehensive list. There's tons of things, relationships, correlations, tons of things. Now, the last thing though that I want to highlight on this idea of profit mechanisms and their corresponding assessment is that do you think all price up profit mechanisms are built the same? And we actually already did a preamble to this a little bit earlier. So, you will actually already know the answer. Rises, no, Cedric says no, I'd rather be skiing, says no, exactly. You guys are all spot on, correct. So then what does that mean? If all price up profit mechanisms are not built the same, what is that then tell me? Cedric says depending on the risk you take, not that's not wrong, but that's not what I'm leaning towards. It tells me very something very important about this step here. This next step.

Rowing Titi says depending on trading goal on what you pick, that's correct for sure, but zoom up one level for you as well. So if not all profit mechanism price up in this example are built the same, what does that tell me about this signal? Rises IDK what zoom up a level means. It means take your thought level from where you're at to a higher level thought. So kind of like a broader thought is the way to think about it. Depending on how the movement moves, now we're getting much closer, we're getting much, much closer. Lance is leading us in the correct. There we go. Joey is on it. Joey is on it, spot on.

So what I just gave you is homework. This is the next action step for you as a beginner, advanced, wherever level you're at. It doesn't matter. You still have to do this. So we need to open up a war doc started trading plan. We need to open up an excel sheet. And we need to create a trade log. And we need to start outlining all of these different profit mechanisms.

So here, the way that I'm going to look for positive drift is different than the way I'm going to look for momentum, which is different than the way I'm going to look for breakouts. Which is different than the way I'm going to look for post earnings announcement drift. But these are different signals or characteristics that qualify this mechanism. So then I need to tie signals to all of these different variations of the profit mechanism. This is a specific profit mechanism. Price direction up with positive drift price direction up via momentum price direction up via breakout to the upside. This is a defined profit mechanism. It's very specific. Because now I can say okay, I'm trying to look for things that are going up and I'm going to look between things that are exhibiting momentum or breakouts. How do I find things that move like this? That's where we start playing with signals. Maybe it's something that crosses above of 50 day moving average. Maybe it's something that's been consolidating for the past 10 days, but then it starts to break above the high of the consolidation period. Lots of different ways to go about it. And this again is trading. Guess what? We still haven't even talked about options. We've been going for what? 90 minutes.

It doesn't matter if you're an option trader, a trader, swing trader, day trader, value trader, whatever you are, this all has to happen. And then depending on how comprehensive of a trader you want to be, then it might be more or less. That's all there is to it. Tedrick says, I used to just look at value. This is so complex. Yeah. I mean, that's the beauty of trading. Because again, like while somebody like you might be a value investor while the market's going down, I'm making money. That's the difference. That's why there's so much work that goes into this is that the whole point of doing this kind of thing is so that you can build an approach that meets your objectives. I've had two negative years. My entire trading career, the worst year was down 4 in change. It was my second year trading. That was my worst down year. I don't have some sort of crazy impressive positive return. I have a good return. But I've built a system that moves me in the exact precise direction that I'm trying to go. So to Tedrick's point, if Tedrick enjoys",

So to Tedrick's point, if Tedrick enjoys doing something like value investing or whatever the approach is, it's totally cool. And if that works well for them, that's totally cool. It's like a very Warren Buffett-esque style. But again, I purposely compare my returns to the SP 500. And then I have in my tracker Warren Buffett's returns as well. Specifically, Berkshire, we bucket it up to Warren Buffett, but it's not just him. But the point though is that I definitely out return Warren Buffett, and that's not better trader than him by any sense. He has scale that he's dealing with and yada, yada, yada. But I do have a better return than him. And I also have a better return variance than him. So the whole point here is to develop something that works for you long term. Roryntitty says this hurts my brain. I know. It's a lot. So then, oh, that'll probably hurt your brain by zooming it in. So then let's let's simplify it a little bit. We can start very, very simply. And then maybe this will make it a little more palatable. So I'm going to group these so that I don't completely lose them. Let's take a look",

I'm a new trader. The first thing I'm going to focus on is the fundamentals of the markets. So for the first month of my learning experience, I'm going to focus on these. That's the first month. That's what I'm going to focus on. So talking about the outlier big four, don't even worry about it. It doesn't matter yet. I'm going to focus on just this.

I'm going to learn about the markets for the next month. Now, I'm going to start getting my house in order.

Once you get down to outline fitting structures, you don't know what structures are. So now we have to learn options. This is where we learn options. Then we build strategies, optimization. That's all future state stuff. That's not stuff that beginners have to worry about too much. This is where we learn options. So now you might be asking, well, Eric, what's the third thing? We've gone through two things so far. What's the third thing? Any guesses what the third thing is? The third most common option trader mistake. We got to swap out our spin drift. The more we got plenty of mingle orange. Reese says no more guesses. Joey says ill fitting structure. Tommy says sounds like to be successful. The whole process has to be completed.

The other thing I would feel very confident in generalizing is that somebody who goes through this kind of process is probably light years more likely to be successful than somebody who doesn't. So I would feel really confident with that. Tommy says not looking at downside risk management, that's fair. I see saving. I think that that's good. I don't see the answer yet. Let's think about it. Practicing is really good. Now, if we think about where we would practice, probably somewhere in here, hopefully, at least that's where I would practice, let's think about it. Let's say that we have two traders. We have trader A and B. Sedrick says how are you going to capture the profit mechanism? Ah, that's step three over here.

Yeah, exactly. But then again, going back to I'd rather be skiing your earlier question of I've gotten lazy. So if you're telling me that you have this tool that you know can fix what you're doing, then why would you get lazy about it? That doesn't make sense. That doesn't jive.

We're worried about what new regulation is coming out or what Senator is cheating based on their position and insider information. We're worried about bitching about the market makers and what we think they may or may not be doing. We're worried about a lot of shit. And what I find fascinating is as traders, we spend so very little time worrying about the very one thing we can control ourselves. The only thing you can control as a trader. And we skip right over it. So here are in my opinion the three most common option trader mistakes and action steps on how not to do it. I gave you the outline here for lack of structure to create your own structure. I gave you the way to start thinking about building profitable strategies that are centered on defined profit mechanisms and the ability to measure signals that help us find those profit mechanisms. The third and final thing that I'm showing you is that you have got to take time to start introspection. You have to look at yourself and you have to understand your tendencies. An easy way to start this is again literally go through my website and see what you think might align with you. We did this yesterday actually. Somebody asked what they asked what",

An easy way to start this is again literally go through my website and see what you think might align with you. We did this yesterday actually. Somebody asked what they asked what I think my largest cognitive biases are and we ran through it. So disposition effect. If you have a trade log, you can answer this. If you don't have a trade log, you literally can look at your brokerage statement. It's not going to be as informative, but I could still see it straight from a brokerage statement. No problem. That's one of the things that I do. Again, when I'm talking with people about this stuff, because what you'll notice is that I think I have one in here. Do I have one in here? Whoa, I have a giant blind spot. Hold on. I'm literally about to have to edit this. So this is now going to become 24 trader decision-making cognitive biases. As you look at this, actually, can you do you have an idea of what needs to be added here? And I'll zoom this out so that you can see most of them. So we can get past the disposition effect, high win rates, can't go broke, taking profits, Goldilocks, skill gap analysis. This is interesting. But there's a really important one that's missing.

And there's a cognitive gap between their perception of reality and what reality actually is. So cognitive dissonance. So the idea behind cognitive dissonance, and I guess I can get rid of bias if that doesn't need to be there, is that we essentially fail to connect reality to what it is. And it's really easy to do this. It's really easy to do this. Off Putin says this is much more rigid and organized than I care to be. Yeah, it's, I don't like this either. It's work. Nobody wants this. But what I can tell you is that something like this is a primary driver of why I've been successful as a trader. Hopefully we'll continue to be. We never fully know.

One of the first questions I have for you is what was your maximum portfolio risk? So let's say on, it looks like you're mostly looking at shares, which is totally cool. And I see that you have total risk as a dollar amount. What's your total portfolio risk? Like let's say, all equity trades and I trade 2 of allocated capital per trade max. Yep. So then, so for example, though, my point is is when I look at this, well, one, it doesn't look like you do that because you're holding equity. So you actually, you can't risk 2 of capital max per trade if you're holding equity. Why is that? Why do I say that? So if you tell me you risk 2 max per trade and I'm telling you if you're holding equity, you're not doing that. Why is that? That's not it. And also a giant shout out to I'd rather be skiing for being brave and sending this in. So first thing I'm going to do is look, I'd rather be skiing up with three fake internet points.

So first thing I'm going to do is look, I'd rather be skiing up with three fake internet points. Because he's the only person that took me up on that. And that's not easy to do. They have somebody look at your stuff and give you feedback. It's very vulnerable. So straight up, straight up props to you. So now, but why is that? Well, let's take a look at an example. I'm going to save this and then I think we can probably close this for now. Cedric says, if you're trading equity, it's harder to manage your risk. No, not not harder necessarily. But there is a dynamic aspect to it. So I don't want to I'd rather be skiing. I'm not going to dox your trades and stuff. I'm just going to pick an example though of something here. I'd rather be skiing says I used position sizing was 2 loss tradable capital. So not 2 of all capital is much smaller than that. Yeah, that's okay too. That's not so much my point though. My point is, is why does that not matter? Because you're risking more than that. So let's say you like Nike and you buy Nike here and you're going to risk 2 of your capital on Nike. Right? So we're going to do 2 of our capital on Nike",

So let's say you like Nike and you buy Nike here and you're going to risk 2 of your capital on Nike. Right? So we're going to do 2 of our capital on Nike here. Well, what happened? Something very specific happened here that does not care about what we defined as our risk. You gap down. There's nothing to be done here. So you got in just proverbial again, I'm not doxing it. I don't even think this is on your list. I'm just picking a random ticker. But we're defining it as 2. But it gaped out. We have more than 2 risk on. If we use a stop, it doesn't matter because this blows by your stop because it's a gap down. There's no controlling this. So now, again, let's play the proverbial. When I ask how much portfolio risk is on at a given point in time, then we obviously can have what our perceived risk is. And I think it's completely fair to use the stops. Right? Royne Clity says, what if only 2 of your capital is in the stock? There you go. Literally the exact point I'm driving towards is I think it's completely reasonable to use what you anticipate getting stopped at because here's the other thing. Let's be realistic. We can't make trading rules based on stuff like this. Right? Because this happens. So then",

Let's be realistic. We can't make trading rules based on stuff like this. Right? Because this happens. So then how do we actually define the total risk of a portfolio at a given point in time if we're trading something like an equity or an option that you can't get out or even a future that there's periods of time that you technically can't get out or don't have offsetting positions is by the size of the position. But then the total portfolio risk is still different. So I measure a few different things, but one of them is absolutely I use the most severe day overnight day drawdown and I just leave it in the sheet as a as a reference. So like for example, what we can do is we can say, all right, let's say for the individual stocks that I'm trading, let's say I'm trading Nike, I'll go back and I'll say like what's the worst overnight move that I've seen and this is if I trade something a lot, I wouldn't necessarily go through all this hassle if it's something that you know like I just anticipate trading once, but from an options trading perspective, you tend to do the same stuff over and over again, like in the same name, excuse me, there's",

So I develop a footprint for all of them. So what I'll do is I'll say, okay, over the last 10 years, what is the biggest overnight gap the stock had that I'm trading? Now I at least have a reference. Again, it could be more than that that the worst days typically are ahead of us. So maybe I can buffer a little bit, add a little bit more, but I at least have an idea of the total portfolio risk. And again, I personally wouldn't use that as my planning factor, but I would absolutely want to know that in my trade log. Because again, what is a terrible scenario is if we don't even think about that, and for whatever reason, there's a giant global macroeconomic event that causes just widespread market panic. And then we have 15 trades on that are sized on a presumed 2 max risk, but they all somehow again, highly unlikely, but let's say not even all of them. Let's say 80 of them gap down 10.

But the reason why you should at least be aware of this nuanced little branch is because the probability of this branch snapping and you falling is very low. It's very, very low. The probability of having 30 positions on your portfolio opening up in 20 of them are down by 10 on a gap down. It is so low. It's not zero. So let's say that you think you're putting money into your trading account and you're like, I don't need this five years. I'm okay. And you go through that experience because you're aware of it. Then you can come out just fine. It's not necessarily the worst thing ever. But let's say that you're trying to save up for a down payment on a house and maybe you want your money in like three years. Then you open up your platform and you see that happen. I guarantee you your decision making capability is completely fucked. It is going to be entirely compromised because you little just gotten punched straight in the forehead from something you didn't see. And now you're trying to process the fact",

That's what I think about here. So yeah, just a couple ideas on that. Now, I mean, my dinner's not here yet. So I'm happy to keep going. We can dive into really anything that you guys want to hit. I have a generally open agenda until my B-dubs gets here. I'm actually pretty stoked for some wings. Not going to lie. Anything that you guys want to talk about? And then I'll get caught up on the chat. Brad says I left a comment on the other video, but are you able to check out the unity calls today? Several five K buys for 8 million premium paired with swaps, GME a lot. How do we know that they're paired with GME? Just out of curiosity.

And then depending on that, we can determine, you know, what makes the most sense if it's something like using options because we want leverage or because we want exposure to volatility or because we want something that collects theta, like those are common reasons to trade options. Equities themselves are just much simpler products. So I think that's essentially the way that I would navigate through when it makes sense to hold equity versus options. I think that's completely fair. Paul says, do you think DJT could have a short squeeze? Well, let's see. We need this. It doesn't look like it right now. It's only shorted 11 days to cover is super short, less than like four days. Yeah. So could it happen? Sure. Like things definitely could go down.

Great question so when looking at something like a short squeeze, there are a few things that are primary drivers. Actually, that video that I sent you is, is that because um, yeah. So the way that I look at it. Short squeezes become more probable in a few scenarios. High short interest. So like greater than 20 I think. And then large days to cover those are the two main things I would look at personally. And then exactly to off Putin's point, um, there's definitely squeezes that are driven by things like gamma. That's super comment. Well, not super common, but an relative in the world of squeezes. That's a common cause for squeezes. So yeah, there's different origins of a squeeze.

And a lot of them think there's so much further than they are that like trying to talk to somebody like, for example, if I made a post actually, I think I did make a post about this. Let me see.

I probably would do it on a YouTube live stream because I honestly much prefer these and I'd rather talk to you all. It's way better than like responding to fucking Reddit posts, I think. But I can collect like different questions and stuff there and see and kind of integrate them. So yeah, let's take a look at that. All right, gang, super fun. I hope the session was useful. I hope that those common mistakes make sense. I hope that you have a pretty clear roadmap on how I would go about doing things. And then as I said, I entirely encourage you to pop in the discord, go into the beginner's section because there's one there built for you. And you can share what you're working on with each other. I obviously will do my best to jump in for the Patreon folks. We have a specific room that I obviously will do my best to prioritize called the learning lab so that if somebody has like a roadmap, they built I can give you feedback. But the goal is to share the things that I really think are transformative for me and hopefully can make a difference in somebody else's trading career and approach because what I can tell you unequivocally is trading is not easy to start.",

But the goal is to share the things that I really think are transformative for me and hopefully can make a difference in somebody else's trading career and approach because what I can tell you unequivocally is trading is not easy to start. But once you build the skill set, it's it genuinely is tremendously simple. And it is one of the very few things you can do that there are no clients, there are no meetings, there are no customers, there are no partners, there are no bosses. It is truly one of the few things you can do in this world that is as solo of an endeavor as you can think of in all of the positives that go with that. Because even if you start a business, you're still responsible to people. You still have to you know pay roles, you still have to make sure that your customers are happy. That is really, really challenging for people. And trading is completely different. Trading doesn't have any of that. Trading is just you. So whatever you're able to do is dependent on you, tons of autonomy. But there's also drawbacks to that. A lot of people struggle to handle that amount of autonomy, which again, that's one of the reasons why we have our community, the outlier community is to help support one another and that into add some structure. So that's the idea. That's why I think it's",

So that's the idea. That's why I think it's worth your while. And even if you trade and realize that trading is not for you, you will be better off as a human being by at least going through the process of attempting to trade understanding risk better, understanding yourself better. It's a win. The main thing is just don't lose all your fucking money. And then it's a win. I'll see you guys on the GME live stream tomorrow. At 5 p.m. Pacific time. And then yeah, I'll give you a Google form, Gendop. And then we can set up some sort of AMA, which hopefully will be a good time. I would definitely enjoy interacting and sharing anything that's useful. So that'll be fun. All right, gang. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.",
