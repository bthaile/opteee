    "text": "We time for a GME update because we have some big news on what's going on today, the 11th of June that I want to walk you guys through now again to be clear. I am an option trader. That is my perspective on this stuff. It's how I got alerted to the most recent price movement because I noticed unusual transaction volume. Obviously it was roaring kitty didn't know that at the time. So I started placing trades based on that. I'm familiar with GameStop, but I am nowhere near as read in as you guys are the ape community. I consider myself a guest in the house as it is right now. I traded the last squeeze, but there's people that have been here over that entire duration really, really involved. So I am having a blast learning about this entire thing. What you guys are working on. Now from a trading perspective, I want to walk us through some position updates and the way I think this thing could go into the expiration next Friday because that's really where all the interesting stuff is set to happen. Now the very first thing we have to talk about is not this tweet, although I think it's funny because we even have somebody like Timothy Sykes now trying to badmouth roaring kitty. I just can't help but find it funny that everybody is trying to say something negative about this guy that roaring kitty is a shell that he's",

I just can't help but find it funny that everybody is trying to say something negative about this guy that roaring kitty is a shell that he's trying to manipulate people that he's falling off the saddle. It's like the dude has hundreds of millions of dollars. Chill out, bro. He's doing okay. And more over than that, he is the greatest sense of humor on planet earth. If we take a look at this tweet from earlier today, it's one of my favorite things because everybody's talking about him trading options and they're saying like, oh, does this guy understand options? Does he doesn't he know about faded decay? He bought premium. It's like, bro, he's a CFA. He is a 68 million relatively short term options position in something like GME. And that's what he's doing. My favorite part is that his sense of humor, I can't get enough of it. It's so funny. He's trolling everybody as if he's now just learning the basics after putting this position on. Obviously, the dude knows what's up. So there's actually one other tweet. This one, that's hilarious because again, his sense of humor on this whole thing is something that I think can inspire just about anybody. He's obviously poking fun at how close he was. He's becoming a billionaire. And then, and you know, obviously",

He's obviously poking fun at how close he was. He's becoming a billionaire. And then, and you know, obviously GME had a rough couple days, which looks like we're probably through. So if you take a look, GameStop, it completed the equity offering. So what that meant was when this first launched, we started seeing massive selling volume accumulate. This is from the seventh of June. Then the 10th Monday, we saw a continuation of that sale volume. This is shares entering the market. They're selling shares into the market that provides a lot of downward pressure. But take a look at today, the day that that volume abated, the day that they announced that it was concluded. Look at the sale volume, minute skill, and take a look at all of these people buying above the recent averages. Shares are being accumulated in DRS. You can see it happening essentially real time here. And it's being represented in price. What I find so cool about this is that means that we lost some ground from essentially 38 were opened here. And then it got pushed down all the way to kind of 25. And then today, it's up over 22. And it's still after hours bidding above 30. So there's plenty of buying pressure here. Now how this",

Because if we pull up, we're in Kitty's position here, the 20 calls out here in 21 June, a few things stick out to me here. The first one is there was another positive 4,092 contracts traded today being added to that. And you can see the current open interest is over 166,400 contracts. So there's people still accumulating in this. The volume for today was 18,879. So there's people just piling into this in droves. There's also a massive, massive change going on here at the 30s. These are people that are being cheaper trying to get slightly cheaper exposure to leverage is compared to going super deep in the money. Couple other really important points here. Everybody that's freaking out about theta decay for him. I don't think they understand the game that he's playing and why he's letting these options that are now deep in the money continue to run because if we take a look at the last price 3049 of GME, that places him over 10 in the money. The amount of extrinsic value left in these options is",

The amount of extrinsic value left in these options is about 1, actually a little bit less than a dollar. So as this goes deeper in the money, the extrinsic value of those options will decrease as intrinsic value comprises more of the premium. So if there's an even more significant price accommodation, this can be massive for him for a couple of reasons, which I will show you right now. If we take a look at his last position update, and again, today's the 11th of June, this is from the 10th of June, and I'll give you updated numbers here so that you can follow along a little more easily. So he still has obviously, as if yesterday, 120,000 of the 20 calls this represents a notional value of 240 million. That's how much money he would need in order to exercise this option and take full delivery not using margin, which he has access to. Right now, these are not trading at 681. These are trading at 11.3. That means his total gain on the position as of right now is 67,495,200 bucks. He's up 67 and a half million dollars. He still has 29.4 million in cash.

And he's getting really close to one of the most interesting ones in my opinion, which would be a cashless exercise. What that means is if the total gain on his position is large enough to cover the total cost, so if the total gain is over 240 million dollars, he can exercise his options and use the gain to cover the entire position. He was very close to that. If not over it, if I'm not mistaken. So he obviously has no problem waiting and allowing the position to play out. He still does have 29.4 million dollars to back him up though. So he's not quite there yet for some sort of cash transaction, but he's not super far off either because his shares will accumulate that he could always offload if he needed the cash, but he won't need to probably because he can always take it on margin where he doesn't have to put up the full 240 million dollars. His broker will request a subset of that because he will have marginal value from the rest of his positions",

Best case scenario for him is if this thing continues to bid up and he can execute that cashless exercise that I'm highlighting, which as of right now does not seem outside the realm of possibility to me. Now the last thing that I want to highlight from just an options trading perspective that I find interesting. Look at the call transaction volume today compared to the puts and look at where they're being hit at, meaning most of them are being taken at the midpoint. So it's people you can make heads or tails necessarily if that's a bought or sold position, which doesn't matter so much in this instance, but look at the overwhelming number of calls transacted 600,000 today compared to 260,000 puts massive callsque. Normally you'll see the inverse when you see this kind of callsque that's people pricing in massive upside potential. Then if we look down here at the OI open interest, let me scoot this in just a little bit so that you can see the rest of that number. You'll see that the",

This is the inverse and then some massive upside being priced in and interesting on top of that, not really resonating into or kind of flowing into the 14 June expiration. It's not resonating with these shorter term options players for this week because the total OI for 14 June is like 176 and the put OI is 173, something like that. So there's actually just not that much flow through into this. The last thing I want to talk about is what happens if he chooses to sell? I've heard a lot of people ask that and it's",

The last thing I want to talk about is what happens if he chooses to sell? I've heard a lot of people ask that and it's okay question. One, the market makers would make them a market. It would be there, but he would take a massive haircut because everybody knows this position is out there now. So if he attempted to start unwinding this position, we would all pick it up. Again, me, I'm a random dude sitting in my house and one of my scanners picked up his buying volume and I didn't know who it was or what was going on. It was just anomalous, which necessitated a trade from me. So think of really all the sophisticated traders out there with incredible technology around this. They'll see it in a heartbeat and they will happily fade into it to follow that down move. The floor would come out if he started trying to unwind this in a big way. So do I think that's what's going to happen here? Probably not. It doesn't seem so much like his M.O. The other thing that I try to remind people that he can do is if he chooses to close his option position, which would bid the market down, he probably would give up some of this gain, but he still would make millions",

The other thing that I try to remind people that he can do is if he chooses to close his option position, which would bid the market down, he probably would give up some of this gain, but he still would make millions of dollars and then he could always just gain exposure again. Buy more, right? He now has way more money that he can do it with. He didn't even go all in on this first run. So he's working on some stuff in the background that obviously I'm not too privy to yet, but maybe you guys know better than me. Again, I view myself as a guest in this whole saga. I'm learning more as we go. I can't help but be completely fascinated. If you're in markets right now and don't think GME is one of the most fascinating things that you can be involved in, I don't know what you're looking at because as you can tell it literally gets me excited. It's so cool to see stuff like this. So all of that is to say, if I look at what I think he's going to do and what it looks like is happening, as this thing starts to rally, if we get that gamma ramp, which looks like it's happening, and we start to see price accumulate even more, he has the opportunity for a cashless exercise, which to me would be threading the needle",

Because then if he does that exercise, the market makers have to go find a bunch of shares on the open market that's already pretty limited because you guys are super smart, DRS in your shares, which is going to bid things up even more because it is a low, low volume pool that they can pull from that they're all trying to pull from. So that looks like the primary play here. He could always exercise part of his position, sell part of his position. There's no rules, meaning he can do whatever he wants with each and every one of those single contracts. What I can say is that I highly doubt he would do anything all at once. I don't think there's a reality where he hits the button to sell 120,000 contracts. He would get murdered on the spread and the market makers would have a field day with that. He would probably have to phase out in 10,000 lot. And even that would be picked up super fast. You get two or three of those out and it would be seen nearly immediately. So one of the coolest things you",
