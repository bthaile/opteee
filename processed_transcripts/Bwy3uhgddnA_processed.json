    "text": "It's easy to get overwhelmed with trying to figure out how to start trading options. They're complex, but there are very easy ways to start and then kind of work your way into the depths of options, depending on what you're trying to do. So take, for example, your a standard stock trader. You find things whether it's based on momentum, value, so on and so forth. You can easily transition into trading something like the wheel, which uses cash secure puts, then you buy the underlying, if you're assigned, and then you sell calls against it. Or you can trade my preferred version of that, which is called the coverage triangle, has some nuances to it, but the same idea. Or you can go really simple, and you can trade long calls on something that you think is going to go up just like you would as a stock replacement. So we go further out in time with those long calls deeper in the money and we use it for leverage. A couple ways to start and then work your way in, being on your CLator.",
