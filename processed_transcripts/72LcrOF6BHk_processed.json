    "text": "What's up outliers? Happy Friday. Welcome to another options trading for beginners session. Believe it or not, we're running out of these. I have a handful of more that are in the docket. And then we're going to switch this series a little bit into something else. So enjoy these while they're here because they ain't going to be here forever. All right, let me get this chat over here. And let's do a quick rundown. First, if you're here, don't forget to say hello. That's the whole point of doing a live stream is to hang out with you all is compared to making videos by my loan sum, which is way less fun. Although I'm not even going to lie, the video that I made today was pretty enjoyable. I like, I looked down at the time and I realized like I had been, I'm essentially at like what? 25 minutes was that video earlier today was nuts because I ended up just kind of rambling about this story because it was nuts. But really fun all the same. We are loaded up on beverages. We have the black berry lemonade from Waterloo. Then we have Mandarin orange from Croger. And then we also have a spin drift raspberry lime. So I am essentially almost positively going to need a pea break, but I am not going to need a break to go get liquid because I have quite literally a plethora of them. So I'd love to",

So I am essentially almost positively going to need a pea break, but I am not going to need a break to go get liquid because I have quite literally a plethora of them. So I'd love to hear how your trading week was. And I want to say a lot of everybody, I see we got Tom Benoit, the sheet, what the sheet could you see, Brenna Gayson, Elon Songs, Mac chicken, OG, what a name. I love that. Kenny Wu, love that Reese Eric. It's my doppelganger. In case you guys didn't know, there's another Eric, which is really, really cool. Steven running D Gen, aren't we all D Gens at the core? Shrey J Mike, we got everybody hanging out. Shane Soldner, that's a hell of a name too. I would have, I'd like my mind goes soldier there, which would have been completely wrong. All right, so what's the deal for today? Well, there are two big things. The first thing is I want to work through this list with you guys, understanding common options trading misconceptions. That's the first thing. The second thing that I want to work through with you guys is taking a look at specifically what kind of misconceptions you've heard. And as always, my intent to go through this session is we should me and are all over. So if there's a specific thing we're talking about from this",

So I just want to encourage people at no point are you bothering me or anything like that. All right, that part aside. Um, Brennan Gates says you see news on Andrew left. Yeah, man, you must have not seen the news on the video that I put out about Andrew left. I spent like the first half a day, or I guess like half the afternoon talking about this dude. So that video is for you because I am aware of Andrew left. And I actually think it's a really, really interesting update to the to the GME story. H says love the content. Thanks for putting this style of information out there. Awesome. Yeah, I love that. That's great. That's absolutely great. Steven says, let's look at Bitcoin. Yeah, I'm happy to start there.

So the reason why is a lot of the sessions that we're doing, they're predicated on this idea of, you know, understanding the theory and the background behind options trading. Now one of the things we're going to do today is actually review a trade that I took off last week so that we're integrating more and more and more practical application. That's where this all goes. You can understand the theoretical, the theoretical aspects of options trading inside and outside ways backwards. Whatever other dimension there is. And it doesn't matter unless you can figure out how to use them to make money. So we're at the point in our journey together. I don't even know which episode this is at this point. You guys might know better than me. I can't even see it. It's kind of annoying actually. The title cuts it off here. What episode are we on? Is this like eight seven something like that? Eight maybe. And so we're at the point now where the groundwork has been laid. And we need to start pivoting the way we think",

I mean, I don't know. It's not doing anything exciting to me. To me, it needs to be above this level before I really care. Essentially up there. This is the way I think about it. Because Bitcoin has been pretty range bound for a while, right? So it started basing down here. So I care about it if it's down below this. And then, okay, sometimes I do stupid things. Like the stupid thing I did there was not change this. I thought I changed it, but I didn't change it. And wait. Okay, so I didn't mess that up. What's happening right now? Why are these alerts? Are these like not good till canceled? What's happening here? Oh, duh. Because it's N24. See, I like I just said, I do stupid things sometimes. So anyways, it's because so in case you didn't know what was going on there and why there was a problem, it's because they're good for this expiration, which is essentially is now.

Like this was a bit of an inflection point in my opinion. Then it just glide, slope down. We based out here. So this tells me obviously people are willing to transact at this level. And it's starting to drift back up. But I mean, to me, this point of control is going to be a little bit of a problem. It looks like it's already starting to break through. So this can definitely start to look like support once it gets all the way through. But it just looks like a lot of congestion right here. So essentially, before it starts getting above those levels, I don't necessarily see like a massive story here. I maintain a position in Bitcoin just in the underlying itself. But that's mostly just because Bitcoin, I think, is interesting. And I view it as a disruptor. And that's the reason why I like it. So a slightly different thought process towards these.

So I'm not so sorry about that to be completely honest, because I know I've been pretty clear about it.

He's typically on top of some of these broader trends. And this is a really important one, because one of the very clear things you're seeing is strength in small caps. That's super important. The reason why it's super important is because that in and of itself opens up a series of trade opportunities if you are a discerning trader.

    "text": "Now I want to be abundantly clear. This took longer than I thought and I told you guys that as well because I originally structured the whole IWM slash Russell trade under the idea that we originally were looking at rate cuts so much earlier in the year and then everything changed. And guess what? Markets do that. Markets change. And that actually goes into one of the misconceptions we're going to talk about in a little bit because one of the hallmarks of a trader is the ability to adapt to changing environments. So again, going back to the community as I'm doing YouTube live streams on Monday talking about the stuff that I'm doing. There was a while back that I told everybody that I pivoted out of small caps and then I pivoted back into small caps when I saw them start doing what I thought made sense. So if you can start identifying broader market relationships, the idea of doing that sooner rather than later is only going to help you. So there's a reality behind time and tenure in markets and it just takes time observing things. You can't fast track that. You can only see things as fast as they happen. So what I recommend to people is just take the time even if it's just for a few minutes, it doesn't even have to be all the markets open. But take the time on a daily basis and try to look at a",

But take the time on a daily basis and try to look at a few things consistently for a set period of time. So for example, pick something like the Russell and just follow it for a week, just a week, but make sure you look at it every day for that week. I guarantee you you'll learn something. I literally guarantee you you will learn something. What it is, it depends on what you know going into it. But by being specific with some of these things that you're literally drawing concerted focus towards will help you. So yeah, that's one of the really important things that happen this week. There's another few things that I think we can draw from this past week, one of which is the market's perception still of the rate environment that we're in. So if we grab this and we look at news, right? So this is from this past week and we take a look at some of the things that have happened. What's happened? Well, home sales came in a little bit light. That matters. Again, this once you start getting the habit of analyzing these things, the first flow of my thoughts when I see this is how we're small lending banks doing that",

There's immediately trade themes that you can come up with just from this information. Now, this is the cool part is you could decide if you're trying to play more thematic things that take way longer to unravel or you could literally play the digestion of this information. Because even though as a retail trader, your propensity to be first in line to see this metric come out and trade it is essentially no. It's probably never going to happen. That doesn't mean that you still can't make money trading information like that as the broad move gets priced in. Because this is exactly how we get into these instances where stocks become so beat down or so elevated. And that's because price is not always rational. It gets pushed to these extremes. And then it slowly oscillates back to normal levels. It's very common. It'll continue to happen.

And it's this idea that in order for new information to be integrated into market pricing, it's not an instantaneous thing. And people have different ideas about it. So it leads to what we call noise price noisiness. So something like this that's just kind of bouncing around and then it just randomly hits 163367. And then it decides, up, that's it to the downside. And then it starts going up from there. That's noisiness. This is not a clean dissemination or integration of information. And it leads to extremes. Tradeable events. So to wrap down this thought here, let's take a look at a couple other things from this past week. So we had the composite from SP PMI. We had the services, global services and global manufacturing PMI. Why would all of these matter? Why do I care about these metrics? And for those that don't know, I want you to take a guess. If you do know, you don't have to answer because you already know the answer to this. But if you're not sure, if you know, I would love to see what the guess is. Shraja is a great question.

Shraja says, what are your thoughts on XLB strength despite poor housing data? It's a great question. It's not causal. It's not causal at all. So just because home sales are up or down, one, the miss was minor, very minor, literally 3.89 versus 3.99. So this is not any sort of giant miss. But the other thing is you have to again zoom out into the broader macroeconomic picture. What do you think home builders would be doing in an environment where they think rates might start to come down? What would they do in that scenario? And that in there lies most likely than not the answer to your question. The sheet, what the sheet says rate cuts or not depending on PMIs? Yeah, that's great. That's exactly it. And Jason's concept of build based on what I was just talking about what the builders might be doing in this scenario is exactly correct. So that's why because this missed by 3.89 versus 3.99 is why XHB doesn't care. There are other factors right now that are overwhelming that data. That's the cool thing, right? Because this is new home sales. This isn't new home builds. This isn't build permits. Take a look at build permits this next line. 3.90 versus 3.4. It essentially tells you the inverse of that, right?",

Take a look at build permits this next line. 3.90 versus 3.4. It essentially tells you the inverse of that, right? It's important to look at individual data points. The example I was giving before when I said looking into those when you see these, it's just to get people thinking about where to look after you see these data points. But it's not that they're causal relationships because they're not. Shane, Shane says I don't know what those things actually mean. That's literally great. I'm glad you said that. Let's take a really quick look together. We don't have to dive super far into this. And the other thing is I actually want to steer you guys away from looking too far into economic indicators because it is a little, I'm not exactly sure it's the best use your time. Is the easiest way to describe it. But there is usable information. So when you look at stuff like PMI, you can see a sent wool. Oh, it's this. I was like, where the fuck did I just get a check ping from? So this is looking at a certain set of data, right? And you can see essentially what's built into the data, what's built into the surveys and what you can deduce from it. Now, if you think",

Now, if you think about what's topical right now in the market, it's anything related to inflation, anything related to cost to produce things. All of that is under a microscope right now because we've been in an elevated rate environment for some time. That will change. That's not always going to be the case. That's this is not always going to be the most important thing out there. And that's the cool part about markets is that during the bull market that we saw essentially from 2010 until COVID-ish, there was a bunch of other things that mattered way more than stuff like this. So the idea is to try and identify what matters at a given point in time from a broad perspective and then find supporting data points that help us assess where we're at in the specific broader picture so that you can come up with ideas. So that's why right now stuff like PMI is actually really, really important. So Shane, that's what the data is. It tells us different economic assessments really. And you can take a look. There's different people that do these. So this is SP global. There are some that there's ISM. That's another really",

I grabbed the website again. SP PMI. Oh, it's right there. I'm an idiot right there. So do you see? I'll throw this in the chat for you so you can take a look. And then you can take a look at the actual reports, right? And you can see what's in there. The sheet also is not correct. It's a great guess, but that's not it either. Fantastic.

Another important one believe it or not, GDP, which is a recent one from this past week. And GDP came in good, actually surprisingly good. I think the market and most people in general were pretty surprised that where this came in 2.8 versus 2 expected. That was much higher for the prelim for Q2. That was interesting. Then there's PCE, which is another important inflation style metric, 2.9 versus 2.7. So what I'm highlighting right now are just some broader macroeconomic measurements that matter to the current market to varying degrees. And you should just be aware of them. So as you look across the previous week, these are some of the important things I think that show up here and that you should be aware of. So that is that. All right, let's get over to some of these misconceptions. What do you guys think of this very first one? This first one says this is how you make 500 a week selling covered calls or easy, passive income.

He's cool. And I like the stuff that he does. We have very different approaches to trading, but I like his stuff. I just want to see what else is in here. There you go. 91 win rate. Who doesn't like a good win rate? And believe it or not, that'll actually be one of the things we talk about in here. In this back here is why, in my opinion, that's probably one of the worst possible things to focus on as a new trader, which no big surprise there. I think it's hilarious that that's a common thing. So anyways, what I'm trying to highlight to you, it's not to go through and poke at these other YouTube videos and stuff. What I'm trying to highlight is the shit that's put in front of you as a new trader. And the fact of the matter is, options are complicated. They are not impossible by any stretch. You do not have to be a genius to figure that amount. I am clearly proof of that. However, this, it's not, it's not a place for either of these is what it comes down to. Could you make 500 a week selling covered calls? Of course you could. But what this comes down to is this is how you",

Of course you could. But what this comes down to is this is how you make 500 a week. What are the things that just trigger in your mind? 500 every week. That's not going to happen with that. Not going to happen with that. And but it leads you to believe that that's true. And the issue with that then is then you start this world of trading with this really contorted mindset and it sends you down the entirely wrong path in my opinion. So that's why we don't like these ones. The idea of easy passive income in my opinion, it also sets traders up for the wrong experience because it's focusing on this idea of easy. And then as soon as we start having to do difficult things to be successful at this, well, we struggle because we started thinking that this was easy and passive. So to both of these in the beginning, I would offer a counter data point for you. So I'm going to go to my website because I'm still building this out for you guys to have kind of some different resources available.

So if we're looking at something that you can make 500 a week selling covered calls or it's easy passive income, then how, how, how is it the case that we see these issues that after five years in the market, generally speaking, 7 give or take of traders continue trading where even a small cohort of them are not profitable. Why is that? If it's easy passive income or if this is how you make X number of dollars a week selling covered calls, why is that? Or this, why is it that of the 7 that continue trading? Why is it that such a large number of them underperform the market on average by 6.5. That's what this number is, by the way, I know it's a little confusing. Why is that? What I'm highlighting to you is all of this stuff in my opinion sets you up with the entirely wrong mindset to be successful in this long term. I would encourage people to actually do something slightly different, which is this. Understanding why this matters to us, right? So this kind of sucks if you think about it. The average",

So I'm real eager to see what this whole thing looks like for Yabola at 61. But my guess is I'm probably not going to do the same shit that I can do today. Then that's probably what I'm guessing. And then if you're lucky, you get to enjoy that 16 years. It's good. 16 years is good, but you only get one shot at this life thing.

And then before that they go in there and they start doing a full spar, we move them at 30, 50, we ratchet it up. Then what happens? What's the difference in that experience? Well, in the latter experience, you are prepared to get punched in the fucking face because it's going to happen. But if you start this without that expectation, when it happens, it completely derails you. So if you walk into this trading world like most of us do, hoping for quick easy money, and that's your base expectation. And as soon as you start to realize that it's not quite like that, it becomes very difficult to continue because you're like, well, this isn't what I thought it was going to be. Do I want to continue doing this? Which is a great question to ask yourself. But if you go into this understanding that in the beginning, it is hard. In the beginning, you have a long way to go. But however, if you're able to turn the corner, then all of a sudden it becomes worthwhile. I thought I had another thing in here, but it's in here. Here. This is it. This is what it's all about. So for those that ask, like how long does it take to get really good at this?",

If you spend five hours every single day without fail for five and a half years straight, you'll hit that typical 10,000 hour mastery, mastery level, five hours every single day for five and a half years. A lot of people grossly overestimate how hard they're working and how fast they're learning. And it leads to this over here, which is a very common wealth depleting effect. Then we have a terrible experience. And then we have a choice. Do we continue this path or do we not? Because here is the beauty and this is the absolute truth. Trading for me at this point genuinely is easy. It is mindless. What I do as a trader is easy. But that's because literally all of the work is done before I click a button. Everything is done before I click a button. All of the hard work is completed before I have the luxury of being able to put a trade on by tapping my screen. That's the reality.

If that were me, I would be focusing on the proper risk mitigation. That's what I would think. G33 says stock goes up, call options go down WTF. That's easy. There's a lot of reasons why that can happen. You're fighting a lot of things with call options. You're experiencing stuff like faded decay, where the value of your option is eroding every single day. You're fighting things like changes in volatility. So if the stock moves up a little bit, but not enough to overwhelm faded decay, you'll lose money. Or if the stock moves up a little bit, but not enough to outpace faded decay plus a change in volatility, you'll lose money. That's the tricky part with options is that it starts to bake in new elements into what can happen in our trade. So for example, if we're looking at something, we'll use GME. If you're looking at something like GME and the reason why I think this is a good example, I'll explain why I think it's a good example. Because let's say that you're trading GME and let's say, let me get rid of this.

Let's say that you're bullish and let's say that you've been in this game for a while and you're trading GME from a long while back. Well, one of the problems that you will face with something like GME is because it is heavily volatile. So your options are going to move as volatility chains. Take a look at both the 30 day and the 7 day vol for literally the past week. It's moved meaningfully. So if we take a look today is what, the 26th. So if we go back to the beginning of the week here, your 30 day vol was like 171 and it landed today like 137. That's a direct input into the value of your options and it just cratered. That does not help you. The other thing with options specifically is that you need to move in a certain time frame because you're holding at the king asset. So for example, let's say that you go back between the two squeezes that we've seen. Let's say that you're somewhere in here and you're like, man, there should be another one soon. I mean, you had a couple in here. So let's even cut those off. Let's say that you're getting in somewhere around here like early 23 and you're just you're hoping for a movement. Nothing's happening.

Let's say that you're getting in somewhere around here like early 23 and you're just you're hoping for a movement. Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening. Well, what is happening is your options are eroding. So what that means is that if you eventually get a move, you now need a bigger move to compensate for that holding duration that you were in and for a lot of GME options traders as far as I can see, they structure their trades terribly and they're using these really short dated options that decay super fast. I talked about that as well in the video today because what I saw was this surprised me actually the fact that more people opened these yesterday into today. I did not expect that and I called that out in the video by the way. And the reason why I did that just for to call it out here in case you haven't seen the video is I think it's important for people to realize that people get shit myself included wrong all the time. So I would have guessed something else here. I literally would have guessed that the vast majority of these people would be rolling their options out further in time, but there was clearly enough yesterday into today to have a net positive inflow into these which that genuinely",

I should know better. Now, if I take a look at where they're moving into though, it's very clearly here, right? The 25 strike next week. There's 10,500 OI against 15,000 new volume. So there's already essentially a very clear ad 4000 plus going on here. What's going to happen? Well, they're losing seven cents every day on something that's worth 65 cents. So you have your 7 decay on something that's at 65 bucks. 10.77 of the options value decays every day. And the fun fact is that's going to get worse. As this gets closer to expiration as a percentage of the remaining premium, this will get worse. So that's a big problem here. So all of that is to go all the way back to whose question was that? Where was it? G 33. That was to answer your question about stock goes up, call options go down. That's why. It's not, it's not that relationship isn't as you're describing it.

Do you put it in TLT or do you do something else with it? Yeah, it's a great question. So the majority is going to be put into things called box spreads because they get a better yield. So here's a video about box spreads. And then there's a log for those interested in learning how to analyze box spreads. That's what I do with my money. So capital that's not being utilized, I use box spreads for a bunch of different reasons, but it's because they're highly, highly adjustable to whatever timeframe. There's a couple really important traits when you're trading something called a box spread. The first one is you need to use a European style option that has no early exercise. That is a massive risk if you're trading box spreads. And especially if you're not expecting it to be there, there was somebody on Reddit that traded a UVXY box spread that they didn't know this. So this isn't actually what happened by the way. This is, oh, let me squish this down. I think this person is trolling somebody else, but this is a joke, right? But they're",

So again, this person I think is trolling somebody else. I forgot the name of the person who actually did the real trade. But this is what that person thought. This person thought that they were putting on a box spread, which if you're buying a box spread and you're doing it correctly, it is a risk-free trade. However, if you're not paying attention to the products you're using, there can be a ton of risk. And that's what happened to the person doing this. They were using UVXY because they were able to get a shit ton of money. Because there's risk, but they didn't realize that. They thought it was risk-free. So they thought it was a really good risk-free return, which obviously wasn't. So that's a big problem. WheelStrecht Joe says, any European style option have a dividend.

I don't think so because most European style options, at least like these, they don't have an underlying, like they would be cash settled. Let me see you're a quick. Do any European style options have a dividend? It's a good question. They do not. Oh no, this says index style options. And then this one says, no, European styles do not usually pay dividends. So yeah. Because what they're doing is they're equating right away European to index options. Rudevega says, what's a European style option? Yeah, a good example of that are the indices. So like SPX, this is a European style option. You'll notice that there's no underlying, right? There's no volume. There's nothing that trades here. So European style options are options that have no early exercise. And they're typically cash settled. It's one of the two types of options that exist. There is American, which is mostly what you're used to seeing. And then there's European. I think this is in here. Yeah.

    "text": "used to seeing. And then there's European. I think this is in here. Yeah. So we would have went through this in one of the earlier videos that we did, but it's totally cool to go back through. So the main component of a European style option is that there's no early exercise. Now there are a lot of reasons why that matters. It matters in terms of pricing. It matters in terms of risk assessment and things like that. But the other component is that many European style options are also cash settled, which is a really important component, because there's no underlying that moves. It's just settled to the value at that point in time. So that's why using something like a box spread in a European style option is so important, because early assignment induces risk that otherwise wouldn't be there, which we're not trying to have. Tom says, are you only using box spreads for capital allocated to the CS strategy? No, I use box spreads for everything, man. Any unused cash in the portfolio, I will absolutely put into something unless I'm planning on using it soon. Now normally I leave a little bit of money easily accessible, right? So like, because like as a trader, I also don't know what opportunities are going to come up. So I'll leave like a few hundred thousand dollars that I can tap into whenever I want. But like the majority of unused cash is going to be",

So I'll put it in typically a box spread. Now to your point, a lot of times that includes capital that's already allocated to other trades, but it's not being utilized yet. So it's not always in one single box spread, right? Because I need to de-conflict by time the different box spreads that I have out against when I think I need that money. So it makes a giant difference in terms of when I want to use the capital, how I set up the box spread, how many of them I need to have on at a given point in time, how much the box spread is worth. All of that is variable, but it's all going to start with trying to use the capital. Now, this is relatively new, especially from what I would have been talking to you guys about. Because if we go back to pre-COVID, pre-interest rate increase, there was like no yield. So if you put money in anything trying to earn something on the cash, it didn't really matter, because you're earning so little that really are just sacrificing liquidity. It didn't really matter that much.",

Good question though. All right, let's get on now to our next one. The market should have done X. What do you guys think about this? Why is this a misconception? What's wrong with this idea? Yeah. What do you guys think? The market should have done X or Y or Z. The notion here being that the market should have done something else. Brennigate says, unforeseen circumstances. Nope, not it. That's not it. The market is irrational. That's not it either. Hater says we don't control the market. There we go. Rude of Vegas says no self accountability. There we go. M. Ram says, views to narrow. You miss something. Could be. Enig says the market will do what it will do. There you go. You guys got it. So the market should have done X is stupid because it infers that what you think should have happened, you surped what happened. The reason why I did whatever it did is because the rest of the market did that. That other thing that you said shouldn't",

So the problem here is that for this kind of trader and for this kind of mindset, you breed massive problems because you start to overvalue your assessment of what should or should not happen over whatever is happening. And it's a really weird concept to get used to, but at some point, you literally have to relinquish yourself to the market. I know it sounds really weird and esoteric. But what it means is even if you have some of the highest conviction ideas, if the market is not agreeing with you, you have to reconsider them. So for example, a great version of this is the big short, specifically when he had these custom swaps made, essentially on the mortgage back securities. And the premium that he was paying on them was literally about to make his fund go insolvent. Is much as that turned out to be the coolest story ever where Michael Burry stuck to his guns. He really knew it was going to happen. And then it happened. You had better believe there was a massively healthy dose of fucking luck. All",

You had better believe there was a massively healthy dose of fucking luck. All the hard work in the world went into identifying the opportunity. The luck component really came into the timing of the opportunity because he almost had to close his positions because he was way too early and he was going to go insolvent. He actually had to go death con five and essentially disallow people from pulling their money out of the account because if they did, essentially the play would have died. So that kind of thing is really important to acknowledge because even when we see these really, really cool stories, you like who doesn't love what Michael Burry did. It's one of the coolest things ever. But he was super fucking close to that whole thing not working, mistiming it and having an entire fund blow up. So while it's really cool to look and acknowledge those really interesting scenarios, it's important to understand survivorship bias, which is exactly what that is. We're looking at a successful result for maintaining conviction and we're not seeing the litany of unsuccessful results stemming from the same exact strong conviction. So what I'm highlighting with number two here is nobody, literally nobody gives a flying fuck what you think should",

We're looking at a successful result for maintaining conviction and we're not seeing the litany of unsuccessful results stemming from the same exact strong conviction. So what I'm highlighting with number two here is nobody, literally nobody gives a flying fuck what you think should happen. Nobody cares. I don't care. Nobody cares what I think should happen. Nobody cares. It is really important to understand how to interface with markets. This other idea of markets can remain irrational, longer than you can remain solvents. I love the saying, but guess what? If the market is remaining irrational for a long duration, what does that tell you? Is it irrational then? Maybe, maybe it is. I'm not saying all instances is not. I just told you in the beginning of the stream that prices can get pushed to extremes that don't make sense. That can happen. But what I'm highlighting is this idea that it's almost like where people will place themselves way higher than they should be in a hierarchy and essentially saying that maybe the market is doing what the market thinks it should be doing and maybe we're just being ignorant and stubborn and we don't like that it doesn't align with what we want it to do. This idea of the market being irrational, longer than you can be solvent is complete bullshit. It's worrying about the wrong thing. It's literally a giant series of bias that are happening in that",

This is another thing that I'm working on for resources for you guys. It's this one. It's a giant list of all these different decision making faults, cognitive biases and all that kind of stuff. All that really fun stuff. There's a few things in this kind of scenario that really, really stick out to me. But this one is a massive one and there's cognitive bias and there's another one that I'm thinking about in particular. I want to see if I can find it quickly. No, no. This one. This one right here. Line spot bias. It's the perception of being less biased than other people and that essentially your desire to assess others is more severe. That's what that boils down to is when you say the market is irrational or can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent, that essentially means that you think you're so unbiased in your analysis of things and the market is biased.

And take a look. I actually find this comical. Take a look at how many subtopics are in this one. Nine. How many are in this one? 11. How many are in this one? Seven. And then you get to trader, behavior and decision making. How many are in here? 32. And this isn't even all of them. There's more that going here. And then I keep going down and I realize this one has 10. This one has 10. This one has like four. This one had nine. You get the point. What I'm highlighting is literally the densest section in this entire syllabus is this right here.

I swear if this is a penny stock. Okay, it's not, it's a reat. What kind of spread? It has earnings coming up. You have to tell me, yeah, you have to tell me what position you're thinking of. In a nutshell, as I look at this six-month daily, bullish trending, Anec says call put, what kind of spread though? There's diagonal spreads, calendar spreads, vertical spreads. You got to hook me up. To me, it looks like it's had a massive move. This almost ran like a small cap, essentially displaying very similar small cap behavior, meaning like the Russell 2000, like a lot of stuff in the Russell moved like this.",

    "text": "calendar spreads, vertical spreads. You got to hook me up. To me, it looks like it's had a massive move. This almost ran like a small cap, essentially displaying very similar small cap behavior, meaning like the Russell 2000, like a lot of stuff in the Russell moved like this. And I see upward sloping standard deviation channels. I see the moving averages now all aligned as they should be. I see a little bit of topping behavior going on here. So for me, I like to see a break up above that of some sort. To the downside, it looks like it's channeling at this. So a break down below that, something like that. Inex says, sorry, bro, you speak like Chinese for me now. That's totally cool. So what I'm highlighting are different kinds of option spreads. So I forgot which part in the series it was. You'll have to go through the titles because I obviously don't remember. But there are different kinds of structures you could put on. So a spread is a generalized type of option structure, but there's a lot of different kinds of spreads. So there are things called vertical spreads, diagonal spreads, calendar spreads, butterfly spreads, iron condors, like those are all different kinds of spreads. The way to think about a spread in an option trade is essentially when you have an additional leg of some sort that offsets components of another leg. That's kind of the idea. More or less.",

The way to think about a spread in an option trade is essentially when you have an additional leg of some sort that offsets components of another leg. That's kind of the idea. More or less. So the way I would look at something like this personally is then if you're not sure like what kind of structure makes sense, then I would start it with what's the thesis. Do we think up, down sideways, which way do we think that RWT is set to move? And then from there we can work, I mean, this is a great example of like building and framing a trade. We can work through that together. I could open up the door for the pup. But that's where it starts. And it says I think up, but maybe hedging also those are literally completely different things. Hedging is the process of reducing risk of some capacity up obviously is a bullish direction. But if we're hedging that means that we want to reduce downside risk, which means we think something is going to go to the downside. So I would offer to you that you have right at the origin of your thesis, you have conflicting thesis in my opinion. So I think you have to start with defining what thesis you have. So for me, again, I see something that's trending upwards here. I don't really love REITs",

I don't really love REITs right now, but the main reason for that is for those that don't know, I have a bunch of real estate that I've been building out into over time. So that's a part of the reason, right? Like I'm not looking for more real estate exposure in the market because I have it off and in the kind of physical sense. So for me, I wouldn't look to trade this in any sort of like significant holding capacity. Now the other thing for me is it has earnings coming up. And I would want to know how it's performed during previous earnings. So we can see oh, oh, wait, this is a REIT. Now I'm very confused. Now I'm very, very confused. Because what?

Paul says some reads, pay good dividends. Yeah, but that's the problem, right? Like again, people fuck up the idea of dividends. It's I would take capital gains every single day of the week and twice on Sunday over a good dividend. Like I don't really care about a good dividend. I'm sure this, yeah, this is a great dividend, right? 8.65. This is beautiful for the product. But what I care about is the price performance. And guess what? Like that dividend doesn't help you when you have an underlying that's gone from fucking 20 down to two back up to seven. So yeah, like literally screw the dividend. People get too wrapped up about dividends. And I would always take a much lighter dividend, much lower percentage with something that has much better capital gains.

So I don't like it for earnings. I wouldn't trade it for earnings personally. And so that would mean for me, I would wait until after earnings and see what it does. Ram Alama. Yo, thank you so much for the donation. Really appreciate it. That will go towards my dinner tonight, which is going to be Mexican food. Ram Alama says, felt content to enter a short iron condor. It was GME, which was unsuccessful, but excellent experience observing movements, thoughts on iron condors. Thank you. Yeah. Great question. So I do not like iron condors personally. It is not what I would trade at all. So the issue is they sacrifice too much in too many places. And I do not see them as overall like a favorable structure pretty much at all. So it's not what I would trade personally is what that boils down to. Matt says thoughts on ASTS. Let's see. Oh, this looks good. I mean, this thing is up and out.

So the way I look at something like this is if you didn't get in today, it's getting late. Like really late. That's how I would do this. So this is okay. In terms of like a breakout play, but really, this is the day I would want to enter on a breakout here. And then if I didn't get in on this breakout, I would definitely want to get in. I would have wanted to be in today because these are lower risk entries. So I don't dislike it. It's definitely moving and it's moving really well, but it just becomes a higher risk entry that I would have to manage the risk tighter and tighter in my opinion. So yeah, I don't dislike it. Paul says they're safe though iron condors. Yeah, who fucking cares, man? Like that's again, like that's a problem with traders is you guys can get too focused on safe. If you want safe, put your money in a safe, right? Like if I'm looking for safe, the market is not where I'm going to take my money. When I'm going to the market with my money, it is for a return. And more often than not, the reason I get a return is because I'm taking risk. I'm not safe. So like I have a special place",

And more often than not, the reason I get a return is because I'm taking risk. I'm not safe. So like I have a special place in my heart when I hear traders that are wanting to hedge all their positions, they don't want to have downside risk. How do I reduce risk? The way you reduce risk chiefly is by sizing trades. That makes sense for you. That's the first way before you ever put the trade on size the trade. So it makes sense. That's your first risk reduction tool. Size your trade well. After that, it's managing the trade. But this like for iron condors, for example, just put on a short strangle and then manage the short strangle if you need to. So I think the problem is again, like this obsession with risk aversion. And I think it's a problem. Ramalamus has preferred strut for sideways moving stock or a bin in that stock and trade something else. I think you're focusing on the wrong thing in that equation personally. So if there's a sideways moving stock, I don't care if the price direction is sideways. That's not one of my profit mechanisms that I leverage as a trader. So when I think about the way I trade, there's a handful of profit mechanisms, things that are directional or volatility. Right.",

And the reason is because if I want to trade something that's going sideways, which is actually a beautiful segue, great question. I don't know if you realized how good of a question this was, but it is a perfect segue into the trade that I was going to show you guys in something called path. There she goes. So what do you guys think I did in here? Why am I talking to you guys about this trade? Any ideas? Talk to me about what you see. And then I got to talk. I got to step away for just one second. All right. Then Wallace says, VRP trade. Yep, you got it. Exactly right. So this is something that is moving sideways. Right. But the basis or the theory for my trade is not price sideways. Don't really care inherently if prices sideways. What I do care about though is if something has variance risk, premium, and this does. So essentially, you can see I highlighted it for you.

And you'll notice that it actually started the variance risk premium for the short term time frame started building. And for the long term time frame looked completely static. It declined precipitously due to this drop. But it was still plenty attractive to me. So how did I trade this position? How do you guys think? How would I have traded variance risk premium in here?

Great to see you. But how much correct it was a short strangle. So I offered the 13 and the 11s at an average of 40 cents. 40 cents. So what does that tell you? Well, unfortunately, I needed to put on 10 million of them in order to essentially get any sort of size on that I wanted. But the basis for the trade is literally as simple as it gets. It's something that showed really good variance or premiums and it still does. So this is still completely well within play and this is built around or right here. It's literally still in my variance or premium play scan. So there's different ways that I can come across the positions and it's generally built based on a portfolio need. So then I'm generally looking for different ideas. But the big filter here is I don't want stuff with earnings. So you'll notice it doesn't have earnings coming up. And yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. So just wanted to give you guys an example. The management of the trade was super simple. All I do is figure out where I want to manage it to the upside set an alert where I want to manage it to the downside set an",

All I do is figure out where I want to manage it to the upside set an alert where I want to manage it to the downside set an alert or rest orders to close the position either or is completely fine. And then just let it go literally just let it go. And I ended up taking it to expiration just because it was behaving exceedingly well. But for these kinds of trades, I very often will manage them early. The only reason for that is because as you get closer to expiration, things like gamma do start to skyrocket. So the overall return on risk is not as good in like the last bits of the trade, typically the last week and a half two weeks. That starts to get not good. The sheet says this is over my head a bit. That's a great question. So talk to me. What about this is over your head? What questions do you have? That's the whole point of these. And I'm glad that you spoke up and said that. Rudebega says, what was the DTE? It's a great question. So the trade was put on 14 June. And it went till 19 July. So that's the first component to the trade. So is about a month 14 June to 19 July.

So you know that fuzz I picked off my dog's face, he's digging in his bed again. So, stop. And he has more fuzz on his face. Yep, that sounds perfect. Good for him. So the sheet, tell me what questions you have. Who's sane sauce? What was your return like? That's another great question. So the trade was at 40 bucks. So let's just call it 40 per lot. The sheet says variance, risk premium. What is it? Great question. So the first thing I'm going to do is actually give you a video that you can go deeper into detail on the concept. But I will summarize it for you. Simply put, variance risk premium is the tendency for implied volatility to be higher than realized volatility. So that means that there is a risk premium being priced into the options where we're pricing in a higher vol. Obviously expecting slightly higher volatility than we realize. So that leads to an opportunity. That's the general concept behind that. So great question. And that's precisely what it is. As always,",

I'm happy to dive in. Now to figure out what this was, not HV. HV is the same thing. So in this context, as I'm framing it, realized vol is historic volatility. Same thing. Now, volatility can be really quirky in that there are different kinds of realized vol. You can have future realized vol, which is kind of weird. But you don't have to worry about that. I actually think in I think in one of the earlier videos we did, but let me see. I think I have a video that really goes into volatility pretty deep. Yeah, here you go. So this video goes a bit deeper into the concept of volatility so that you can kind of see. Tom says, how do you go about picking an expiration for the type of trade and how do you see VRP for a certain amount of time before placing the trade? Yeah, so I can care about persistence or magnitude of VRP that will depend a little bit on the opportunity itself. So in this case, it's a little bit of both. I saw persistence over",

I saw persistence over time and and then in terms of expiration, that's more about the portfolio. It's less so about the individual trade. But like if there's earnings coming up, obviously, I'll see how I feel about the earnings. If there are other trades that are going to be coming down, it's mostly going to come down to how is this thing going to fit into the portfolio. VRP plays, there's sloppy, right? I'm not really trying to maximize each element of the individual position because I'm just expecting to put on a fair number of these things, have a fair number of them work like total shit and in the aggregate, have them make money. So it's an important differentiation, I think. But yeah, DTE, I think to give you at least something resembling an answer would be something between two weeks and 45 days, 50 days, something like that. I think that that's fair. The sheet says, or more important, let me see, the sheet says so IV above HV is basically on the indicator, you know, that's exactly it.

    "text": "that that's fair. The sheet says, or more important, let me see, the sheet says so IV above HV is basically on the indicator, you know, that's exactly it. Or more importantly, the change in IV versus HV versus before, great questions. And the first one is that's correct. So this indicator is literally plotting a few different things. It's plotting imply volatility for different time frames. The plots you see here are for a week and then a month. And then these white lines are historic or realize volatility, past volatility. And you can see there's two different time frames. The dark is like 30 day realized. And then this is five day or one week realized. And then the purple lines with red, those are actually tracking the variance between those two. That's variance risk premiums. So notice how between this bright yellow and this white line really big gap. And then you can see between the bright pink, how it turns super red. It's essentially that like the near perfect inverse of this. So that's essentially what that indicator is showing me, showing me volatility so that I can visualize it. Benoit, I won't get tired of that name, Benoit. So hilarious name. It reminds me of Archer. I don't remember if the dude's name is Benoit, balls, whatever that guy was, but that's what it reminds me of. Benoit says, what's the most appropriate profit mechanism to focus on capital preservation of a small account? Okay,",

Benoit says, what's the most appropriate profit mechanism to focus on capital preservation of a small account? Okay, well, I personally don't like those, right? Like the idea of capital preservation in a small account. If the goal is to preserve capital, it would be like dollar cost averaging into an index ETF using some sort of moving average momentum following strategy to play positive drift. That's kind of the the way to preserve capital. Now, beyond that, assuming that we want to trade and depending on what small capital means, let's just call it like sub hundred thousand something like that. Then in that scenario, if the goal is to like really try to grow the portfolio, which would be my approach, would be trying to grow without having massive drawdowns would be primarily direction strategies. So things like ratio diagonals, I have an old series on the playlist from, it was called small stacks and it's still there. That one hasn't gotten nuked yet, but that one goes through this entire process of trading a small account. Now, I traded both the coverage strangle and the ratio diagonal, the ratio diagonal provided a much better return in that portfolio, but the coverage strangle provided a little bit of like a keel where my PL wasn't highly",

So yeah, that's essentially the way that I would think about it. I personally would be trading ratio diagonals and believe it or not, I have a video on this exact thing for like what account or what strategies I would use in a small account, which is right here. So you can check that video out. And then I funny enough, the small stacks segment pops up. So I'll give you the first video in that segment here. And then it looks like there's 16 parts. It was a three month experiment. I made 26.85 over the three months. So not terrible, not great, but we still have money. So that part's cool, I guess. That's not so bad. Behemoths says what delta do you use for strangles? It's not a fixed thing. It's highly dependent on the individual product. I would say general bans though would be anything from 40 delta's out to five. If I had to ballpark an average, it would probably be like 30, I think is a fair average normal go to delta.

And again, like I know what you guys are trying to do and it makes total sense to do that, where essentially we're trying to come up with like simplified heuristics for how to use these things. But the problem with that with options is that is another, it's another bias that you have to find it one second. It might not be on here. Anyways, there's another bias essentially where we seek to oversimplify things. And I think that's partially what that is. Like just trying to come up like what DTE to use or what what delta to use. Like I said, I totally, totally understand the origin of the questions. But it essentially will always be a variable component to some degree. And the reason for that is that that's the whole concept behind options is to have that kind of variability. Because without it, right, like if you didn't care about any of that stuff, all you would do then is trade the simplest expression which would typically be the underlying itself. Let me see what that bias is called. I can't. Oh, fallacy of a single cause. Oh no, that's not it. My bad. I'm",

    "text": "essentially when we try to oversimplify a lot of those components, we lose a lot of the details associated with them that kind of make them what they are because they actually are kind of these, I would honestly, I would almost call them like magical concepts because the cool thing about options is that there's a lot of variability that go into them. And in my opinion, that's that's kind of the benefit of them is that you can very, very carefully structure them to be what you want them to be. So yeah, I think in this context, you can come up with general heuristics, which again, it's normal. And I think it's a good thing to do because in doing that, you essentially simplify the way that we're analyzing information so that it's more palatable. But I think it's also important to make sure that we identify like what components make the most sense for what we're trying to do. And then make sure that we're prioritizing the correct components. So like for example, when I hear something about the Delta selection, you guys tell me, when you're selecting a Delta, what's the trade off? Let's say that we're picking the same expiration, same product, all everything else is the exact same. But what's the trade off when you're picking Delta's? There's a few things that come to mind to me. So price to risk ratio, that's part of it for sure. Think of things like how",

Think about things like management. Right? So what happens if I sell a 40 Delta strangle versus a 10 Delta strangle? What are the things that you guys can think of? And I want you to specifically to think about the overall P and all of the position. I want you guys to think about how the path of that position will look. 40 Delta strangle versus a 10 Delta strangle. You guys tell me what's the difference? Depreciation, that's not it. It's a good guess, but that's not it. Risk of assignment, that's part of it. Bingo, Tom has it. Tom, Tom summarized it really well. So what Tom is highlighting is that you can make more money, but you're in a scenario where it's much more likely to give you problems. What's another thing? So let's take a look. Let's take a look in here, for an example, and let's say that we're looking at something that's like 45 days out. Let's just pretend that these were liquid. You have to use the monthly. Fine. We'll just use the 21 days. So using the 21 days, what do",

I don't know why these are, oh, because the 10 and a half is to like this 14 Delta or 10 Delta or something like that. There's another really important component. There's another Greek that you guys need to look at. Gamma, bingo, that's exactly correct. That's exactly correct. It's gamma. So the reason why we care about gamma is because that tells us that the path of our returns has the potential to be super painful. If you have an option that has a higher gamma, it tells us that its Delta's can move a lot, and it tells us that the overall position will move tremendously more. So if you take a look at this 36 Delta option here, it is a gamma of 28. If you take a look at the 14, 10 Delta, whatever this actually is because the options are kind of messed up here, this one has a gamma of eight. So that means for every one point move in the underlying, down here, your deltas are going to move by 28. And for every one point move in the underlying here,",

Much, much, much different behavior of the position. So that's why the decision of selecting deltas matters a lot. And that's why there's not a set answer on what Delta to pick for something like a Strangle because it heavily depends on the product. It heavily depends on how this thing fits into your portfolio and how you want to manage it. Those are all the nuanced details. So for example, let's say that, I mean, let's literally go through an example. But before that, actually, let's take a quick look. We already saw this one on this idea of how much effort goes into being successful. I think we already talked about that. We can kind of, this is perfect timing. We've talked about a bunch of those already. We can skip over that. Here, this is a great one. So we actually talked about this before. So do you guys remember when who was it?

That whoever I did that example with, they did this exact thing where we focus on some element of a structure and not on the profit mechanism. So the misconception here is that a structure somehow makes a trade profitable. And it doesn't. A structure is just a way to capture a profit mechanism. Profit mechanism is what makes us money. So that's actually a great example of what we were reviewing before. Now, to take this example into this example now, this idea of a profit mechanism, if we're thinking about trading VRP, let's just pick something random. MSOS looks okay. That I don't love. GME looks great, but this is a unicorn. I would not have naked options and it's same thing with Chui. Let's use something like MSOS. We use something slightly different. So MSOS, let's say that we want to structure a variance risk premium trade in here. Let's just say for whatever reason we like it, it doesn't look bad to me. And it doesn't have earnings coming up too soon. It doesn't look like. So now",

Let's just say for whatever reason we like it, it doesn't look bad to me. And it doesn't have earnings coming up too soon. It doesn't look like. So now let me just double check really quick. I'm going to change this time frame so that it is just a little further out. Yeah. So it doesn't have earnings coming up just yet. So we have a little bit of time here. So let's say we want to structure our strangle. Let's say that we want to keep it in a primary expiration and we're stuck between two. You can either do 21 or 56. Neither one of these are optimal. So for me, depending on how the portfolio fits and all that kind of stuff, I'm going to trend towards this one, the 56. A little bit longer in duration, but for this style trade, I don't care about that. And it's for a bunch of different things. Now opening this up, let's see what's in here. Benoit says pot ETF could be affected by political, of course. Yeah, that's the thing is everything as risks, right? Yeah. And I obviously appreciate the call out, but that doesn't matter to me. I'm coming in here literally to make money. So I expect to take risk. So if we take a look at something like this 32 delta and this",

And the reason why that matters is because this is not a portfolio margin account. So we can see what the margin of requirement would be for most people, which is super cheap, 837. So in this case, we'd be taking in about 83 bucks and we're putting up, let's just call it like 850, something like that. So it gives you a 9.8 return over that 56 days. Now that does tell me that the risk in this is elevated because that is a pretty high return. Now the other thing I need to see is how do I want to manage this? Well, my break even to the downside is let's call it six six bucks, something like that. And that puts me at a 45 dollar loss if we get there. And to the upside, it's about let's call it 10 bucks a little bit less than that. Like 986. And that puts us at an 80 loss.

I would come in here and I would say, okay, I need to start getting out of this trade if it gets up to 986. So let's call it 970. I need an alert for up or above that. And then down to six, I need an alert a little higher than that. Give me a minute to see it. So give it like 614, something like that. At or below that. And then trade goes off. So then the other scenario would be, okay, maybe I can trade this. What is this? A 14 delta and this 14 delta. And we can compare this in this case. I am making 30.

I have a much higher probability of this trade working out. So let's just use the worst scenario for a quick example. Let's say to the upside, my risk is at 1130. And I would be realizing a 124 loss. So if we look at 1130, the probability of hitting that in 20 September, look at the probability of a touch. What's the probability of us hitting 1130? 17.8 probability of being stopped out to the upside within our time frame. And then I forgot what it was in the other trade. It was like nine something, right? 971 I think it was like 980. So let's say in the same time frame, what's the probability of us hitting 980? 37 chance.

If I wanted to analyze, okay, I don't want to take it all the way to expiration. Let's say that I hold it until there's maybe 14 days left, something like that, something about two weeks. So something around here. What's the probability then? If instead of managing it at the equivalent of this 20 September expiration, I'm managing it in the same DTE equivalent. If I were to leave two weeks left, which would put me here at like the 30 aug. Now what's the probability of me hitting that 980? That probability is now 27 chance. And then the 1130 is like a 9.7 chance. So this is the game. And you have to figure out what makes the most sense. There is absolutely no right or wrong answer. But that's the exact process you can go through to see what makes sense. Let me know if the answer is a question for you guys. Hussein says, would you consider Delta for regular options calls puts?

Of course, Delta is one of the primary inputs for literally every single trade that goes on unequivocally. The sheet says all things equal look for the highest ratio of Delta gamma. No, not at all. That will change massively. Again, depending on the disposition, what I'm trying to trade the underlying thesis. So I would not personally look for that. No, it's a good guess. But yeah. Tom says, if I myself picking Delta based on strikes that align with my perception of support and resistance, yeah, it doesn't matter. So like picking the Delta at those levels doesn't matter. Because again, like that's not necessarily where the trade management is. You could essentially think about the idea of structuring the trade so that you would manage it at those support and resistance levels. So let's say for example, you thought resistance was at 907 and you would want to get out for something that is above that. You can do that. You can structure your position so that it makes sense for management. But make that selection based off Delta and putting your Delta where you think that is to me. It's not, it doesn't make sense. It doesn't align. Unless you're just managing it when it gets to the strike inherently. But",

But if you were doing it that way, then it at least would make more sense. Benoit says, what time of day do you typically put on trades for new positions? This is a great question. Typically towards the end of the day, it depends on for a new position, like a net new position. If I manage and trade, sometimes it'll be throughout the day, kind of whenever it comes up. And then I do put trades on and off in the morning again, like sometimes people I think they get too binary when we have conversations like this. So it's important to reiterate that it's not that I never put trades on earlier, but I typically will put them on towards the end of the day. There's a different kind of liquidity that happens then. And you miss the first hour illiquidity and volatility rush, which I don't, I don't want to be a part of just because you get way sloppier fills. So unless there's a specific reason for me to get filled or to enter at those times, I typically avoid it. Iceman says, when managing a trade that",

No. So I assume we're talking about this trade that we were looking at. So specifically looking at the idea of like a short strangle like a variance risk premium style trade, because the reason why I'm coming with that assumption is because that answer also would depend entirely on the strategy and what's being traded.

When it's time to manage that position, that's why those things get defined before entry. And it has to marry up to the thesis. It's really, really important for those things to line up.

So you too will piss off everybody that asks you a simple question when you respond with it depends. Shane says, based on what I've been told, having a set rules is beneficial. Can be I agree? So here's what I would say. I think it depends on the strategy as you design it. So if you have a strategy that's a little more geared towards discretionary, I don't think being purely mechanical is good. And I think the trader needs to maintain discretion. However, it also cannot be a random selection of things. So the way I look at that is I make sure that whatever rules set I'm applying generally makes sense. That's the first thing. So the next thing is to make sure exactly as Tom highlighted, because if your strategy is baked on taking 50 profit, that's okay. But it needs to have an effective expected return based on that parameter. So the first decision that really depends on what route I would take that answer is if we're trying to devise a more mechanical strategy, if it's more mechanical, then yes, we need to decide how",

    "text": "okay. But it needs to have an effective expected return based on that parameter. So the first decision that really depends on what route I would take that answer is if we're trying to devise a more mechanical strategy, if it's more mechanical, then yes, we need to decide how that mechanic mechanical approach will play out. If it's a more discretionary approach than no, then I think that that can actually be a problem and it needs to be a little more individualized to the opportunity. The issue that you have with things like taking things at a blanket 50 profit is it really does depend on how you're managing the losing side of the trade and does it maintain positive expected return. Paulus says why 50 and not 30 or 80? The reason why places like tasty trade do that is because they're trying to provide people a generally applicable set of rules to simplify things. That's why. So when you think about something like why 50 is because it applies to a lot of strategies in a lot of circumstances where it generally is okay. It loses a lot of specificity, which obviously I look for, I care about the details. So that's why I don't do something like that. Now for me, if I'm trading a more mechanical variation of something like my zero DTE SPX strategies, for those kinds of things, I have a more mechanical profit taking approach applied and it's because it's like",

Now for me, if I'm trading a more mechanical variation of something like my zero DTE SPX strategies, for those kinds of things, I have a more mechanical profit taking approach applied and it's because it's like a numerically based strategies the same thing with things like earnings plays. But for things like ratio diagonals where there's a lot more discretion involved, I don't apply that same methodology. So it does depend quite a lot on the strategy. It's a good question though. Fanta Veraplane says, Hey, do you think GME is a good spot to write covered calls? I am conflicted because IV keeps dropping, but I would like to make some money while the stock trade sideways. I mean, yeah, if you have long shares and you want to write calls against them, then that's okay. The component of IV contracting, that's one component of the trade, but like GameStop still has high IV. It's 90 and a half percent. So you're going to get still a completely healthy return for selling calls. Now to your point, you're not going to make as much if IVP were higher, but that still doesn't mean that you're not going to make money. You still absolutely will make money. Provided that it does what you want, meaning not go blow through your short strike, then obviously the short call will lose. But when trading something like covered calls",

Provided that it does what you want, meaning not go blow through your short strike, then obviously the short call will lose. But when trading something like covered calls for me, volatility, specifically IVP or the relative volatility level, it's secondary. I don't care as much about that. As long as I'm getting a decent amount of money as far as I can see, on what I'm capping in terms of upside potential and I'm okay with that trade off, then it's fine. But I wouldn't not make that kind of trade just because implied volatility is low and it might go against you temporarily because that doesn't really matter. If you're going to hold the trade, then it still would make the money. It just would be a potential loser in the interim. So yeah, I wouldn't care about that at all. Next question. Our next misconception, options are too risky. You guys should know the answer to this one by now. It's not that options are too risky or not risky enough. It is simply that options take whatever risk you give them. That's it. It's literally all there is to this. You can structure options trades that are very risky.

If I'm 21 and I have 15,000 saved and by the time I'm 35, I know I want to have over a million bucks. Well, it tells me a few things. It tells me I'm going to need to have a better rate of return and it tells me I'm going to need to get really good at saving money. So if I get to the point where on average, I'm able to save 1,000 a month over the course of 14 years and my return, I can target something around 15 on close, but not quite. So you can see if I save just 100 more per month, I would be at 640,000. So depending on what this number feels like to you, then and again, it's important because when you're 21, will you be able to put this away? Probably not.

Depending on how much money you make at 21, but it's probably not going to be enough to support that. But what I'm talking about is this on average because you had better believe by the time in your late 20s, early 30s, you should be putting away way more than this. And if you're not doing that, you're not living essentially a viable lifestyle for your broader objectives. And you need to go into what I like to call monk mode. That's what I spent most of my early 20s and what I call monk mode. And it's so that I could really amplify this and maximize my contributions as much as humanly possible. So then you could say, well, maybe I am able to save that extra 100 a month, makes a pretty big difference. And now let's say you look at a slightly different return variance profile where you say, well, plus or minus 3, how can I do? And well, you realize if you're able to do 3 better than this 15 and that puts you at 18, now you're at 823,000. This takes somebody from a 15,000 account saving on average 11,000, which is a lot. But again, if you're able to get to this point and compensate later in your compounding approach on average, it'll still work out",

Then over a 14 year time span, by the time you're in your mid 30s, you can be very close to having that million dollars.

And now all of a sudden, that's now completely possible. And you have 1.3 million. So then we could say, well, instead of then saving that much money on a monthly basis, maybe I save 800, which is even more doable, but you've given yourself a longer runway. So what I'm highlighting is going through this process. You literally can use this tool. It's why I fucking built it on my website because I use this all the time myself. But it'll give you a lot of clarity. So then going all the way back to this idea of like being a greedy degenerate.

Well, if I realize that the path of being a greedy degenerate can include stuff like this where I might have really good years, but then if I have one not good year, it actually can really derail my growth. So for example, portfolio one here, both starting with 100,000, portfolio one has a 10 return, 10 2, 10 5. The best year in portfolio one does not outperform the worst positive return from portfolio three. They both have generally positive years, but portfolio three is one negative year. That one negative year, even though they have a better average return of 8.6, their compound annual growth rate is 6.87 over this five year period. So what I'm highlighting is that this drawdown is a massive problem because this drawdown of 25, it needs a 33.3 return to recover back to break even. So when you make these mistakes as a greedy new trader trying to grow a small amount of money into a big amount of money, the only thing we do is move the goalpost backwards. That's it. So that's the way and that's really the general tip and advice I would give to somebody that's struggling with that is to develop a process in a roadmap that you believe in, that you're comfortable with, that you're willing to commit to and then commit to it because the world of",

In my early 20s, when I compared myself to all of my friends, I was actually worse off than a lot of them. And then in my mid 20s, I started noticing a little bit of a difference. Then in my late 20s, I started noticing a pretty big difference. Now in my early 30s, I noticed a massive difference between me and most of my friends. Where at completely different places financially. And it's because of adherence to this, while a lot of them in their early 20s were fucking around. They wanted to go out to the bars, have a bunch of fun, which I get that. That's really attractive. That's super fun. But it's really difficult to essentially become a self-made millionaire without making sacrifices of some sort. They got to come from somewhere. And if you want to do that in a relatively compressed time frame, like by your late 20s or early 30s, you have to sacrifice even more. But if you do, it can be very worth it. That's the tip.

Let me know if that answers your question, silly Russian. Now going back to this, who saying says, because of things such as time volatility, price movement, up or down, that's not it actually. The reason why this is a common misconception and why this doesn't matter is like, you don't need the underlying to go to your strike to make money on a long option. As long as it goes in your direction, the option will make money. Again, Ceterus Parabus, everything else remaining the same. Let's look at an example. If we look at, let's go to Tesla. And let's go here to 25 June. Let's buy. This might be even better actually. Let's go to the 12th, something that's not as aggressive of a move. Because then the 13th, there is a decent size move.

I realize that when I talk a lot, my nose gets itchy. I don't know what that is. I actually think it's like my nose hairs that are vibrating too much. Fun fact, by the way. All right, let's see these options. And then let's do something that's like 37 days out. And let's pick out of the money option. Let's pick these 190s. So let's pretend that those got put on for like 590. Now let's fast forward to the 13th. Let's see what happened here. So on the 13th, we had a little gap up, a little bit of wall because we gapped up and started closing back down. But you can see we're not at our strike. Our strike, I think, was 190, something like that. Yeah. But look what happened. We got in for 590. It's trading for 1120 now. This option made a decent amount of money. Yet it did not hit our strike. It went in the correct direction. The other thing notice, this isn't some really short term dated option. These are 36 DTE options. And this is looking at the passage of a single day. Yet the trade made money. How is that? It's because you don't need the underlying to go to your strike in order to make money. Like that's literally the punchline",

It's because you don't need the underlying to go to your strike in order to make money. Like that's literally the punchline to this. It doesn't need to do that. You can make money with this kind of position as long as you get in a accommodating move. This is another really common misconception. All right. We got another question here from Paulo. When do you roll a strangle into a straddle versus realize loss? I don't really roll them into straddles very much. And realizing a loss typically happens at the predefined PNL target. I don't bother rolling things like straddles or strangles too frequently. If it's not working, it's not working. I'll close the trade except that it didn't work and then just move on to another trade. Something like that. There's not a giant benefit to me to keep attempting to force the trade to work. I tend to take slightly more care in terms of how I'm selecting PNL targets and stuff like that. That's not to say again that I never will roll, but that's definitely just not my go to. I typically will do a slightly simpler approach on setting targets ahead of time. Next one. Buying is better than selling your vice versa. This is one of the most common misconceptions I see.

That's another kind of tied version of this. So if one was better than the other, why would anybody do the other? Just doesn't make sense. So the way to think about buying or selling is they both have their strengths and weaknesses. They both have their pros and their cons. But one is not inherently better than the other. They do different things. That's the way to think about that. This is a really common one. You guys, I bet you some of you probably think this right now. There's 40 of you on the stream right now. My guess is at least one of you probably think this that if you're selling options that going further out of the money is safer. What does that mean to you? And why do you think I might frame it as that might not be the truth? That might not be the case. Any ideas? And then silly Russian says absolutely going to dive in your resources.

Benoit says it's just less likely to happen, but when it does, it will be worse. Will it be worse though? So for example, let's flip the script here. Let's look at here. 22 April to 29 April. Let's go there real quick. 22 April. Let's say we sell a call. We know it's going to go up. Let's sell a call. We'll sell two calls. Because Benoit, what you're seeing actually is not fully correct. And I want to show you why. So in this case, let's pick a 30 Delta short here. Let me, I'm going to throw this in the chat so that I remember. So the 155 calls is at 440. We'll just do it at the natural price. So we'll do the sell to open here. And these are a 31 Delta. So 0.31 Delta. Now let's take a look at these ones. So to open the 190 calls, you're going to get 53 cents for those. And then those are at a 0, 0, 5 Delta. Cool. Now, let's go forward. What is it like a week to",

Now, let's go forward. What is it like a week to the 29th, I said? Cool. That's right. Let's see what happens here. So our 5 Delta's, which were the 190's here, they become 47 Delta's. And they represent essentially like 785, something like that. So now we sold something for 53. We got to buy it back for 785. So that's a negative 7732. loss on the 0, 0, 5 Delta. Now let's take a look at these 155's. These are now trading for 3282. So we sold something for 440. And we have to close it out for 3282. That's a negative 2842. Negative 2842 on the 31 Delta. So what do you guys think about that? Does that align with what Benoit showed us? It does not. Why is that? Why does it behave that way? There's a few things you have to pay attention to. Benoit says, but the position size was very different. The risk capital wasn't the same. It's a one lot for both. So the margin requirement for both of these is not going to be wildly different. It will be different to your point, but I don't think it will be wildly different. Let's double check. So we went back in time again.",

    "text": "wasn't the same. It's a one lot for both. So the margin requirement for both of these is not going to be wildly different. It will be different to your point, but I don't think it will be wildly different. Let's double check. So we went back in time again. We're going to check at these. What is the 155's? Yeah. Let's see what the margin requirement is for these. These want 2600 bucks. Now let's take a look at the 05's. These want 2,100 bucks. So no, I also disagree with you there, Benoit. The position size is actually not that different. This is T margin. They're going to require very, very similar sizes based on a naked short call that are only this far apart. So also good guess, but also incorrect. It's super simple. The reason why these don't lose more money as a gross dollar amount is because they have a lower delta. It's literally the start of the trade because remember, these 155's are going to have a higher gamma and a higher delta. So after we get that first 1 move against us, these 155's are going to move against us 31. These 5's are only going to move against us 5. That's it. That's on the first 1 move. The gamma on these super far out of the money options hasn't started to change that much yet. So maybe on that next dollar move, you only lose 5 bucks again. In this case,",

So maybe on that next dollar move, you only lose 5 bucks again. In this case, your gamma already gained one gamma. So your 31 delta's became 32. So you lost 31 bucks on the first point move. Now 32 bucks on the second point move. So you have what? 63 bucks lost on a two point move. 10 loss, two point move. It's exactly why that the severity on these is not going to be as bad because they're further away. Now the caveat here is that the return on the risk is slightly different because these you're only collecting 50 cents. These you're collecting 4 and change. So the return on the risk has a slightly different profile. But the further out of the money, that that's the tradeoff. That's why you make so much less is because there's a lot less risk total in this position. Now you have to also think about the realized PNL or the realized loss against what you stood to gain the return on your risk. And if you don't have such an extreme example, but let's say you have an example where the underlying just goes to at the money. So let's say that let's just pretend that there's a move that takes these 155s and it",

These you sold them for 442. They'd be trading for 1010. Right? So that would be your loss. Now let's say the same move happens for these 190s. You stood to make 53. You get a 15 point move. So these 190s would look like the 155s. Ish. A little further out. These would still show a lower loss, but it would be a higher relative loss to what you stood to make. So I think that's what Benoit was attempting to convey in that scenario. But that's only one scenario in a gross dollar amount. You'll still do better in terms of reducing your risk.

    "text": "kinds of things all the time market makers trying to get them, somebody's trying to get them. And it again is handing the keys of control over to somebody else. And there's no reason to do that. It is all about taking as much responsibility as you can and figuring out how you can affect outcomes. That's what the entire entire focus is here. That alone. Nobody's out to get you. Nobody cares about you. They're just trying to make money just like other people are trying to make money. But by focusing on the things you can control, taking responsibility for things don't go your way. That feeds the system to eventually optimize it and find something that works. If you think something is out to get you, then it's really difficult to manage around that. It's not. The way that the market is out to get you is that it's competitive and it's looking for easy money. That's a thing. And that will be the case. And you have to learn how to operate in that environment. So these are 12 misconceptions related to options trading and obviously a bunch of individual random offshoots we took along the way. But I had a blast. I love talking about this stuff with you guys. The next session for next Friday will still be in options trading for beginners. I have a couple of other things that I want to work through with you guys. And then we're going to",

I have a couple of other things that I want to work through with you guys. And then we're going to transform this into what I would call an options trading boot camp series, which is just going to be pivoting it more to the practical application of this. And it will be less theoretical concepts. But I hope the information is useful for you. And as always, if you guys have any questions, let me know. And the last thing I'll note is tomorrow I am doing that GME live stream. If you guys want to check that out. And if you're not a part of the outlier discord, it's completely free to join. I encourage you to do so. Tons of cool people in there and great learning resources. So enjoy the rest of your evening for those that want to do the GME live stream. I'll see you tomorrow. And then for the outlier pro members, I'll see you Sunday for a market prep session. And thank you very much for TGO1 for the 20. Really appreciate that. Thank you. That will go directly towards my dinner. That'll hook me up with the burrito carne asada burrito. That's the that's what we're targeting here. So thank you very much. I appreciate that generosity a lot. Thank you. Awesome",
