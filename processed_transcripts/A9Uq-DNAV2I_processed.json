    "text": "another crazy day in GameStop we had tons of call volume we have volatility moving around and then player two has entered the chat with roring Kitty coming back with this tweet of this dog 00 a.m. today kicking off a pretty interesting move to say the least in chewy that we'll take a look at and this is another instance actually where my option scans picked up the move so then I was like what's going on in chewy I played it today because how could you not on the movement but then I was wondering what was going on and then I came across this tweet a little bit later and it all kind of made a little bit more sense now let's start with a quick recap because we haven't heard from roaring Kitty in a while his last tweet was on 17th of June and then today we had this this I do not know the lore behind and as you guys know I am here to keep it a buck I'm not going to talk about stuff that I don't know I know about options and trading you guys know way more about the background behind all of these things I just have peripheral information so my current understanding is that this is a dog emoji that they replaced he replaced the eyes with these green eyes so that's a purposeful move as compared to the standard eyes that the normal Emoji has and this",
