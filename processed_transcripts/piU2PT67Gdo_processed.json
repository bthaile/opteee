    "text": "What's up outliers? Welcome to outlier options trading tips where you learn something new in three minutes or less today. We're going to talk about the heavily appealing alluring low DTE far out of the money options. And we're going to talk about why these are almost always a terrible purchase or even a sale for that matter. So here we have Tesla for the example and everything's crunched down because we're on the vertical screen here, but I'll walk you through what you're looking at. You're looking at an options chain for seven March that expires in three days. And if we take a look at these three 35 calls way out here, they are a super, super low Delta, zero point zero two Delta and they're very cheap. They're 13, 14 cents that seems so cheap. You can just throw these on for less than 15 bucks. You get a big move man would these make a lot of money. So what's wrong with them? Well, there's two things that are very wrong with them. The first thing is if we take a look at something that's closer to at the money, let's take a look at these two 80s. The volatility on these two 80s is about 77.6. The volatility on these three 35s is 99.4. What does this mean? It means that the volatility in these is jacked up. And it's because these are the tails that counter side of the trade demands in even higher",

And it's because these are the tails that counter side of the trade demands in even higher premium because of how little money there is to be made from the sell side. Against what the severity could be if there's a very big move. So on a relative basis, these are really expensive to buy. That might lead you to think, well, then I should sell them. Well, not quite the reason is because for stocks like Tesla, the probability of outside moves is pretty high. It's still in frequent the size of the move you would need in order to make a bunch of money on this. But the issue is one losing trade from the sell side can wipe out not even like a couple winners, but we're talking dozens of winners. So that's why it's dangerous from both sides of the equation. Now the last thing is if we take a look at the probability of us hitting 335. And within expiration, you're looking at about a 0.2 probability. This here is a one-stinter deviation move. So then you might say, well, okay, from the buy side, it looks bad because it's really low probability. So then I should sell it. Again, the problem is is that the tails are a little fatter than",
