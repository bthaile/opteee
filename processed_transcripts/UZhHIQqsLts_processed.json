    "text": "We're two and a half years into a bear market. If this market makes a new low, it's going to be the fifth longest bear market in history. And everyone is discouraged. The breakout, last fall of the day is failed. The markets acting terrible. People are fearful and they're looking away. And they're going away. The running away, exactly classic fool rookie move. Major trends can occur. Change three to four days. It can change everything can change. And now it's like, well, the war is escalating. The government's probably going to get shut down. We have two idiots running for president. One's my idiot. There's a lot of reasons to be very nervous right now. And the market is down trending down in four days. This market could look completely different. You're always three to four days away from a major market turn up or down. And right now, the feeling I get from talking to people, seeing the market in my PL is we're getting really close to a new bull market. And everyone's looking down.",
