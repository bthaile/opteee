But let's take a look at what we got going on. So in the back, you are going to see my built C7. This is kind of my pride and joy. This was my dream card growing up, and right now it's a little over a thousand to the wheel, which sounds really cool, but it's kind of not, I run it turned down because you can't apply that to the ground. So it's not as useful as you might think. Then we have Eric's tire on forum because with powerful cards you go through tires pretty damn quick, also a couple of surfboards if you need. And then we have the forward Raptor, which this is kind of more or less the daily, go to the gym, go on trips, super comfortable, a lot of room inside, and then we have the new toy, which is the McLaren. So kind of a different ride for every occasion, every vibe, which one are you taken, being out on our sea all day.",
