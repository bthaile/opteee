    "text": "for essentially the the next few series the other thing I noticed here is that if we look at the call open interest compared to the put open interest if you look at the videos that we did the past few days these used to be much bigger disparity for the calls even excluding roaring Kitty's position there was still a lot of participation skewing this these are now starting to normalize we typically would see more puts than calls people tend to hedge to the downside with options rather than speculate to the upside in Mass at least obviously an anomaly here that we're looking at so it looks like there's still a little bit more to the story perhaps roring Kitty will let us know but he also is the master of mirrors he has my head in a blender trying to figure out what's going on here and it's super fun to try to figure it out so I'm really thankful to learn along you guys about the history of this stuff and talk about options so thanks for sharing so much with me if there's anything else that I can help with or if any questions you guys have just let me know and see you guys later",
