    "text": "What's up, you guys? Take another look at roaring kiddie's position from yesterday, because I was in the middle of making a video. He dropped his position and I shared a hypothesis that I don't think is accurate. So I want to walk through what I'm seeing, what it could mean, and essentially why nobody can tell definitively what's going on here. Now, a couple of things. You guys have been sharing so much of the background of roaring kiddie, the way he behaves, which is actually really useful for me. And one of the things you guys said is, hey, he seems to exercise his options lock. He'd take another look and absolutely. And as we take a look at this, it absolutely could be the case, but it's kind of a bit of a stretch in different ways, depending on the scenario we're looking at, but some of them are very plausible. So let's quickly recap what his position was on the 10th of June, which is long 5 million shares at 21.274. And he was long 120,000 of the 20 calls at 5.67 4 cents. Now, a couple of things right out of the gate. These are big positions. When you're trading 5 million shares, 120,000 contracts of options, you don't just enter a single order to get into that position. It's something that you scale into over time. And the reason being is you don't want to bid yourself up. The other thing is in order",

It's something that you scale into over time. And the reason being is you don't want to bid yourself up. The other thing is in order to get essentially reasonable fills instead of just getting killed by submitting some sort of market order to get a fill at that, you again, would scale into the position over some time. So that tells us an important fact, meaning he averaged into these positions. We can also determine that and confirm it by the fact that there's more than two decimals on all these prices, meaning the average price paid varied more big positions scaled into over time. I'll kind of checks out. The reason why that matters is because that tells us specifically on these calls that some of the premium he paid was above this price. Some of it was below this price. How much higher and how many of those contracts we don't know and same thing to the downside. So it makes it really, really difficult to pinpoint what the premium he would have paid on the exercised options, which is what we're using to try to determine if that's what he did. So I'll show you what I mean by that. Now, a really probable scenario here is that he could have exercised 40,000 in 10 of those 20 calls that accounts for",

Now, a really probable scenario here is that he could have exercised 40,000 in 10 of those 20 calls that accounts for the number variance here. It doesn't account for the cost variance here, which is important. It could, but it doesn't outright equate, which is unfortunate because if it did, it would have been a much easier problem. But I guess that would have been less fun at least for me because I like looking at this stuff. So we'll kind of walk through the math of that. Now, one of my favorite scenarios that I have to give a shout out, just because it's so off the top rope is this scenario that he might have sold all 5 million shares and then exercised 90,000 in 10 options, which we'll take a look at that scenario as well. I think that's probably lower probability, much lower, but not again, impossible. So let's take a look at some math. What I did up here is show you the original position on the 10th of June for the equities and then the same thing on the 13th of June. Now, one important admin note is actually when you multiply his new basis of 23 4135 by 9,000,000 shares, it's crazy to use these sides of a positions in GameStop for retail trader.",

Now, one important admin note is actually when you multiply his new basis of 23 4135 by 9,000,000 shares, it's crazy to use these sides of a positions in GameStop for retail trader. It's hilarious to me. But as you do that math, it actually doesn't come out to this. It comes out to like 210, 74, 9 and change. The reason why that matters is because I'm using what he has here on the platform, which might account for some other costs or whatever the case is. I can't say for sure, but just noting that variance. So if we take a look at the difference between what his equity position was and what it became, we can figure out essentially how much he bought and how much he bought per share. So in this case, the cost variance between these two is 104, 374, 465. The share delta we already know is 4,000,000,000. So that comes out to a cost per share of 26.9. Now, let's take a look at this scenario here where we exercise 40,000 in 10 options. That essentially brings us to a slightly different number. The combined assigned or exercise basis in this case would be 25, 67.54. We're taking the strike price, adding the premium. This is what the broker would calculate within the platform here. This is different than what the exact transaction costs would",

This is what the broker would calculate within the platform here. This is different than what the exact transaction costs would be for the shares on the market, which would be at the strike price. But after these shares are added at the 20 purchase price, the broker could then marry the premium paid in the scenario. So that leads us to 25, 67, 54, which is quite a bit off on a percentage basis as well from this 26.09. It might not seem like a lot of 41, but that's definitely a lot on a relative basis. And if we take a look at that exercise cost in the scenario of 40,000 and 10 contracts, the cost variance between what we see now as the difference between these two, which is 104, 374, this would show it as 102, 727. Close, but still off by 1.65 million. That's not an insignificant amount of money. Now, this could be explained by the fact that this is a small subset of this 120,000 lot position.

It's not crazy. And because this is a smaller subset of this, that absolutely means that there can be a higher variance from the average. So that's within the realm of possibility for sure. Now, another scenario somebody threw out the crazy one I like is exercising 90,000 and 10. The problem is the variance is massive. Now, this is wrong here. This shouldn't be comparing it just to the equity. It should be comparing the total cost in this scenario. So the total cost here would be 231, 104, 275 and his cost was 210, 744. So that's a big variance. I just probably wouldn't see that happening because the other thing is it would not account well at this point because now instead of it just being essentially a third, it becomes three quarters, 90,000 and 10 to the 120,000. So then the probability there of a big variance from this average price goes down. So I don't see that one quite as plausible in this scenario. So all of this is to summarize a few things.

We don't fully know and the impact doesn't seem to be severe at least as of now because when we take a look at the way that GameStop behaved today, really inside day, it had lower than average volume. This is looking at a 22 day period for the average just to be clear. And it was mostly sale volume today. We also saw just in terms of price of very inside day. The range for today was 1186.

But there's still people in this for sure. And it's super deep in the money at this point. It's one delta. Now there are a couple other centralizations that I see at the 30s. There's 57,802. But today there was massive volume. 46,010. We don't know if that's opening or closing just yet. But that's just something to note. So either this number will probably go up pretty significantly or start to contract. My guess is probably the latter, but we don't know. And same thing for a couple other these noteworthy strikes like the 35 and also the 40. The other thing I see here is the implied volatility across these expiration cycles is contracted massively. It's cratered. This was above 300 before. And now it's below 250. Same thing for essentially the next few series. The other thing I notice here is that if we look at the call open interest compared to the put open interest. If you look at the videos that we did the",

The other thing I notice here is that if we look at the call open interest compared to the put open interest. If you look at the videos that we did the past few days, these used to be much bigger disparity for the calls. Even excluding Roaring Kiddie's position, there was still a lot of participation skewing this. These are now starting to normalize. We typically would see more puts than calls. People tend to hedge to the downside with options rather than speculate to the upside in mass at least. Obviously an anomaly here that we're looking at. So it looks like there's still a little bit more to the story. Perhaps Roaring Kiddie will let us know, but he also is the master of mirrors. He has my head in a blender trying to figure out what's going on here. And it's super fun to try to figure it out. So I'm really thankful to learn a long you guys about the history of this stuff and talk about options. So thanks for sharing so much with me. If there's anything else that I can help with or if any questions you guys have just let me know. And see you guys later.",
