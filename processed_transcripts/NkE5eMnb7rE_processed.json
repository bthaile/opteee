    "text": "We got an easy one for you today. What does it mean to be long a call option or really long any option? In this context, long simply means you bought it. This kind of can be tricky for new traders because you can be long an option but short the market. What's an example of that? Well, if you bought a put, long bought, the put, however the disposition of that trade is bearish, meaning short the market. So there's long in short with respect to the transaction, whether you bought or sold. And then there's long short with respect to your disposition towards the product, whether we think it's going to go up or going to go down, being out on the other side.",
