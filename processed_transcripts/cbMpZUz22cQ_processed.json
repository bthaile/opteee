The fact of the matter is, is can you trade options or sell options for income shore? However, it's going to look completely different than what you think it does based on different kind of videos that you see that talk about this on YouTube. And realistically, you have yourself the audience to thank for this because YouTubers are incentivized if they want to grow their channel to make stuff that people are going to click on, which is junk like this. Things that would make you believe that you're going to get this 1,500 a week and, you know, weekly income. The fact of the matter is it's going to look completely different. However, there is a way to make this work. And I want to show you how at the end of the video, I'm going to show you an absolutely accurate example of how this typically can go so that you understand why these kinds of things will set you up for failure and how to instead set something up that might be a little bit more robust. So let's talk about this idea of selling options for income. What are some of the common approaches we see?

Well, selling premium, as we know, and this is because traders confuse a really important transaction, which we'll talk about. You'll see stuff like cash secure puts covered calls, the wheel, these are all very, very common for trying to sell options for income. However, again, there's some important details missing. So let's talk about this. What is income income? As money is received, especially in a regular basis for work or through investments, notice how there's a very important, very important part of this on a regular basis. This gets completely destroyed in options trading. And again, I will show you how. So if we think about what most people think when they're selling an option, they think that that credit received is their income. So if I sell a put for a dollar, that 100 that enters my account, they will think that's income, but it's not. And I'll show you why. If you have a 100,000 account, and let's say that you sell puts, whatever combination expiration is under that matters, and let's say you collect the 1000. Here's what happens in your account. Your net liquidating value does not change. It's still 100,000. Then your cash and sweep will go up. So this is essentially assuming this 100,000 is not in an",

It's still 100,000. Then your cash and sweep will go up. So this is essentially assuming this 100,000 is not in an active trade. This is maybe just in short puts or something. The cash and sweep will go up by the credit you receive. But notice how your net lick doesn't change. This is because this 1000 is tied to a position that is open. So yes, you can withdraw that 1000 out, but then your net liquidating value doesn't stay at 100,000. It goes down to 99,000. So then it's still tied to an open trade. So then if this trade doesn't go on our favor, and you have to close it for a loss, now your account is even lower still. So this idea is possible, but it's going to look completely different. So let's talk about how this might work and the way that I think about it. The first thing that we need to do if we're trading options for income is completely get rid of this idea of selling is the way to income. Just completely throw that out. The next thing is to completely reconfigure the way that you think of income. So here's what I would do. I would start by defining how much money I need on a monthly basis, then zoom that",

I would start by defining how much money I need on a monthly basis, then zoom that out to an annual basis. And then I would pad that number because life happens. Things go sideways. So if you think you need X,000 per month, give it a small buffer on top of that. And you also have to account for things like taxes. What do you actually need to make in order to net what you're trying to pull out? You have to have those details ironed out. Then what I would do is actually save at the very least one full year of this padded cost. And then I completely throw out this idea of selling options for income and I trade normally. That's it. And here's the way that this works. If we think about our return path over the course of a month, it looks different than linear. And I'll show you. Got my handy dandy drawing pad. So if we draw a time series and we break this out into months, you will have some months that are positive. You will have some months that are negative. Some months might be more positive than others. Some might be a little less positive. What most people think about is selling that option this month",

This is almost assuredly going to fail. And I would really, really challenge. I've not seen somebody successful in doing this. And I've been doing this for over 18 years. Here's a much better way. If we think of this same time series in the fact that our returns might be slightly lumpy, but at the end of the year, they're positive. Well, that gives us something to work with. What it means is that if in month zero, the front month, whatever that is, you withdraw your money out and you continue to trade normal. Instead of trying to trade this month gains and use that for your income. If you save this full year in those gains, pat up month 12. So then you're really withdrawing last year's month one if that helps you conceptualize this. So the whole point is that you're withdrawing down on this one year runway that you gave yourself.

Everything becomes very, very different. And it's because your livelihood becomes completely dependent on your ability to generate money. And I've never met anybody that hasn't had a bad month. So if you're trying to approach this in a way where you give yourself this month month's money based on what you make this month, that is about as robust as a sheet of paper. It doesn't make any sense. If you want this to actually work, you cannot approach it this way. You have to be methodical. If this were me and the way that I do it is I don't even think about one year. I think three to five years. But I'm also overly conservative. The reason being is because I have my mom who I take care of financially. So it's all stuff that's in the back of my mind. That's why mine's going to be a little bit more conservative.

I promised you an example to demonstrate clearly how this works and why it works. So let me show you. Take a trip with me back in time. It is now two December 2024. Apple just finished a pretty serious consolidation range and it's starting to break out to the upside. Apple is literally seen as like a tech dividend, it's just a tech safe haven. It's like a dividend stock for big holders. And it's because it's so stable. Trillion dollar market cap massive company continually does well. Starting to break out, you decide to enter into your position that you are going to use to generate your monthly income by selling options. Let's take a look at an example. So we're going to look at two different scenarios. We're going to look at the covered call scenario and then we're going to look at the short put scenario. Now don't worry about all the stuff that's on the screen. I just want to use this as a way to help us keep track of what's going on. As you can tell, I took us back in time.

As you can tell, I took us back in time. We're going to go forward in time. So what I'm simulating here is it's two December and we just bought 500 shares of Apple at 240 bucks. Cost us 120,000 dollars. I'm not worrying about how much money we need and income and all that stuff. None of that matters for this example. So if we are to trade this covered call, that means on two December when Apple is 239 240, we're going to sell about a month out the 27 December 245s, a 35 delta, we're going to like 2.49. We'll do a five lot and that'll give us 1,245 bucks. That's for this month, this front month. Okay, cool. Now let's fast forward time and see what happens. Okay, so this is finishing loading. You can see that the stock has gone up from our entry point of two December, which is right here. This candle right here and it's gone up. It's gone the direction that we want. However, we have a little bit of a problem because our position is now slightly underwater. So let's take a look at what this would look like.

Now somebody might say, oh, I would have managed it earlier. It's all effectively the same thing that comes out in the wash or oh, well, let's just let the shares go. You can do that. But then in this scenario, it actually will, it will work out worse on the back end and you'll see why. So the main thing that I want to show you is that if you sold these calls and you took your initial premium out and you withdrew it, you can do that. The problem is you will have to then put in money because you're at 3640 in the red that you have to cover. And right now, unless you're in a portfolio margin account, if you don't have access to margin, your cash is used. You bought this stock. So then in order to cover this, your cash and sweep right now would be 1245 if you left the money in there. So that means give that 1245 back.

Okay, great. So let's say that we don't want to do that. And instead we choose to roll our option. Okay, cool. So in this scenario, 27 December, we go to the 250's. So we get our strike five points up. We go out to 21 Feb. So you notice that we had to go really far out in time now in order to get this roll. We're still in the money at a 63 delta. We get 12.60. This gives you 63, 100 total credit. And that puts your PNL at this point at 2660 if this expires out of the money. So this doesn't look too bad. Okay, well, let's think about it. Let's just assume in this scenario that I just showed you that you're able to, if you just go to expiration, if you're able to take these down for 0. Well, let's think about what just happened.

Over the course of that three months, whereas your initial trade was meant to bring in 1245 of your income, you know, 2660 of income. You are woefully short. Now again, I'm not saying this is bad. This can come out in the wash if you give it a long enough runway. But again, if the idea is to use this month's income or withdrawing this month, that's where you run into your problem. Now, let's take a look at the short put side of the equation. It's challenging as well. So while I simulated the call side of the equation, I simultaneously simulated the put side of the equation essentially using roundabout the same amount of money. So this scenario pretends this is not here. So you don't get the money from the calls. You just get this. So this takes us again from two December into 21 Feb. Now there's a problem here. So if we then take a look again at the map, this one's a little bit closer, right? Because you made 1035, then you made 2400. This puts you closer onto the target that you want for",

Again, we can say like, oh, manage it at 50. Or I would roll it or I would do this that the other thing. It doesn't matter. It's just different versions of the same outcome. In this scenario, what ends up happening is you get a couple successful trades upfront. You can see that. But what I want to show you is the big problem with this. The big problem with this is this. If we go for our next option from 21 Feb, we sell that for 33 cents. We get the 240s. We get 4.77. We started a 30 delta. We do five of those that gives us our 2385 credit. But notice this.

But if you take assignment, you're not going to be able to sell calls above your basis, that whole bit. If instead you choose to roll them, what you can do. The problem with the role is that you're going to have to close these for 44. That's going to realize a net PNL of 19,615. That's a net loss on that first trade. So this is what your PNL would look like down 16,180. And then if you on 17 April roll those out to the 240s, so you don't get a basis adjustment. But take a look at how far out in time you have to go. This should be June of 24. Look at how far out in time you have to take this trade. You now have to go 64 days out in time. That's a problem.
