    "text": "Yes, the standard error, so many new options traders make. And this is the absolute illusion of short term performance. One of the problems with things like this that you'll see here is new traders are at a point where they really don't know what they don't know yet. And then when they start seeing some near term success, they kind of make broad assumptions based on that and then they kind of project that forward as a future expectation, which is almost always never the case. So one of the things to keep in mind is with trading, the sample size matters a ton, because if you're going to trade a long time, you're going to see a lot of different markets. So it is super important to collect a lot of really good information so that you can analyze what you're doing, make adjustments as you need, because this will not last, you not all your sale error.",
