    "text": "The reality of trading options, I've been in the markets for 18 years now and one of the largest issues new traders have is actually picking a goal that's reasonable. The reason why it's so damaging is not because picking a crazy goal and missing it. It's because traders often will pick a crazy goal and then realize they have to take an insane amount of risk to get there and it's all completely unproven for them. They don't have to skill set. If you go through a place like the options subreddit, you can see things like do most obstastrators see 1,000 returns regularly, which obviously is absolutely insane. Even something more modest, I got a DM about this pretty regularly where people say, hey, can I make 1 a day or even 1 per week? 1 per week sounds pretty reasonable, but if you look at the return, it's like 69 annual lives. Sure, you might be able to hit that a couple of years if you have a solid year, but you will do that consistently is literally world record breaking. So having some context on what we're trying to do in the reality of the game we're playing, really important to prevent taking too much risk in pursuit of a very silly return. Be an outlier, tell it.",
