    "text": "What's up outliers? Today we are going to talk about rolling short puts in levered ETFs. Right now I'm trading the covered strangle on a few different tickers, two of which are levered. One of them is SSO. This is a two times S and P 500 index ETF. And then there's T triple Q. This is a three times leveraged NASDAQ QQ ETF. Now the reason why I trade these, I have an entire video that talks about trading the covered strangle on leveraged products. Significant reason is because of the volatility premium that gets priced into them. And a big element of the covered strangle is the short legs that are part of it, which I'll show you really quick here before we get into the rolls themselves. If we take a look at, let's say the covered strangle here that we're going to be talking about in T triple Q's, this is the position as it sits today. So you'll see that right now, this is all part of a model portfolio. I've kind of taken my main portfolio and broken out a couple chunks to trade the covered strangle in a couple different sizes that are more relevant to kind of just general people building out their accounts. And so right now the covered strangle on T triple Q's is combined with 500 shares. So there's an equity position. Then there are two trances of short puts. This is obviously a short put position. And then",

Now today, I'm going to be focusing on the rolling of the short puts. And that's because especially in something like in leveraged ETF, it is a delicate balance. Why is it a delicate balance? Well, this is why. Because if you take a look at the overall price performance of something like QQQ and we zoom this out, let's do a three year daily. You'll notice that it goes through different periods where it can have these very broad, nasty, turn downs. In this case, this represents a 34 decline. If we look here, this is a 41 decline. This one is 23 and a half. This one is 32.8. This one's 35. It looks smaller because of the scale, but it's not. It's a 35 drop. This is 58. This total drop here from Pete the Trow.

And the way that we choose to manage our positions around them is essential to the success of the strategy. One of the primary ways that the covered strangle performs so well is because as the market is going down, I use the strategy to turn a profit of the option side of the equation. And then when it begins to rally during this period, I'm dollar cost averaging into it very carefully. And then as it rallies up and out, I have a really great basis that takes advantage of the eventual recovery. So the broader context here is the management of the short puts is literally essential. So one of the things that I want to direct your attention to are creating the objectives for the role. What are we trying to do? And there's typically two broad buckets that I think about. The first bucket is maximizing profit potential. The second bucket is maximizing basis reduction. Now as it pertains to the strategies that we're talking about here, I am focusing on basis reduction. Why? Well, it is for this context that I was actually showing you a little bit earlier.

It's because if we take a look at the frequency of various size moves in both SSO and T triple cues, you can see that on a monthly timeframe, they can have pretty significant moves. Greater than 40 is not supremely infrequent. It's infrequent, but not supremely infrequent. So because of that, the way that I apply the mental model to these short puts that we're going over now is very much from the context of how can I continually reduce the basis of the options so that I can be in a better, in better spot to take advantage during the eventual recovery. So let's take a look at an example here in T triple cues. So on T triple cues, you can see on the 12th of Feb, I had sold five of the 78 strike puts expiring again 21 March for 293. So let's go to 12 Feb and let's see what this looked like when I entered it. So 12 Feb is right here. This is in the face, almost top ticked it, real good at that. This is in the face of a pretty significant decline. So if we take a look at what the underlying has done since I got in, it rallied up and then it is essentially just concentrate down.

I took them down for 10.25 on the 4th of March. So let's take a look at the 4th of March and let's see what happened then. So again, this is the entry point here and then the 4th of March is right here. So the reason why they needed to be adjusted on the 4th of March is because I was running out of X transit value. The risk of early assignment was starting to grow. So that's why I took them down. And again, what I told you I took them down for was that 10 and 25 cents. So now, what's the next step? Well, again, going back to the first objective, the stock has gone down 24.1 percent since I got in. My objective here is to reduce the basis to try to manage my basis as best as I can.

And I actually rolled it for a debit. That means that I closed this option for 10 and 25 cents. And then I opened a new one for 9 and 80 cents. Why would I do that? Well, it's because net net. This is still a premium, meaning I'm still collecting a credit. If we take a look at the series of transactions here, I took in 1465, I then closed out for 51 25. And then I opened up the new ones for 4,900. So that still nets me out in a positive position. And the big thing that was accomplished here was adjusting the strike nearly 4. I took my basis from 78 down to 75. So not only does this reduce the basis pretty massively, but it also positions me to be able to take on a larger position because the covered strangle requirement has gone from 39,000 now to 37,500.

If we take a look at some rough math that I just sketched in here, the difference of these two is that 1,500 bucks with T triple queues currently trading at 61 89 that literally represents an additional 24 shares that can be purchased at spot price through this reduction. So that is one of the big things I'm paying attention to. Notice how I did not add any size here. Why did I not add size? Because we are still potentially in the very early stages of a decline. Do I think T triple queues is going to have another 82 decline right now? I personally don't, but just because I don't think that's what's going to happen doesn't mean that it can't happen or something worse. So what I'm doing is I'm thinking very carefully not just about what is happening right now, but then what can happen with the position as we go further out in time. And this is why I am so aggressively attempting to manage basis because what eventually happens is if this strike becomes too buried, meaning too far in the money. And the underlying continues to go down. It becomes next to impossible to continue rolling it out or a credit or even something that still yields a profitable position post roll.

    "text": "happens is if this strike becomes too buried, meaning too far in the money. And the underlying continues to go down. It becomes next to impossible to continue rolling it out or a credit or even something that still yields a profitable position post roll. So then that means you either have to choose to take assignment, but if your basis is too high, then it really doesn't help improve your position much. So then you're just tying up money and something that's not moving. So my goal is to be aggressive upfront. This does come at the cost of total profitability, but right now I am heavily prioritizing the basis adjustment element of this trade. So that's the game plan as it sits. This is one of the main concepts that goes into rolling short puts with respect to leveraged products is having a tight game plan on how we intend to manage it by understanding the actual flow of premium as it pertains to the position. And I have another video that talks about rolling options in detail. I will absolutely share a link to that in the notes below. And as always, if you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. See you",
