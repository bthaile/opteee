I was actually connecting with him not too long ago for another conversation on his podcast, but it's great to have you on. Thanks for hanging out. Yeah, man. Thanks for having me. Well, I'm stoked that we got through the marriage counseling session of first self for those that don't know we spend like 15 minutes talk about marriage learning a lot. But I also wanted to thank you for sponsoring this podcast. Oh, yeah, of course. How how do you do that? Oh, well, I don't know your assistant said that there might be some sort of transaction of lured photos afterwards as payment. Get out on the side. I don't know what we've ever had that counter sponsorship. I just assume that's like it's like a it's like a goodie bag. I send everyone. Yeah, that's what it was. Yeah, I miss. I guess I was just going to scalp the pictures. They'll get out there. But okay. Yeah, it's honestly great to connect. So for those in my audience, just so you get like a really quick background. Most of them are traders, option traders, right? The world that you know I talk about, but yeah, one of the goals of the podcast that I do here is I really try to pull in people from different backgrounds to give",

The world that you know I talk about, but yeah, one of the goals of the podcast that I do here is I really try to pull in people from different backgrounds to give people different tools that they can integrate into their toolkit. Right. Sometimes there are different things that make sense. And like when we talked on yours, you know me, I'm not just a trader. Like I do have commercial real estate. I do have angel investments. I absolutely have my hand in a lot of different buckets, because I think it works. So that aside, now you understand kind of the general people that we're talking to just so you know the technical gap to get into. Talk to me a little bit about why real estate for you. I don't know that I actually thought through a why real estate when I first started so much as when I was going on recruiting duty, I was like, dude, I should buy a house. And then my real estate agent at the time was like not super helpful and you know my boss when I checked into recruiting was like, you're too busy for that shit. You know, don't worry about it. We'll figure it out some other time, but just go get yourself somewhere to live. And so I went and just rented something I tapped out and then",

And so I think I've just always liked the fact that like, you know, with trading, you at least need some of that capital, even with options trading, you need something. But, but you know, when I first looked at stocks, I was like, I don't have any money. So this is not going to be something that's the growth because I got nothing. Oh, wait, you'll give me a 80,000 house for, you know, 3 grand. That's cool. I can make that work. And so that was kind of what made sense to me, I think. Well, you bring up a good point with the leverage aspect of real estate. And it's also there is like an intrinsic value component to it. Yeah, you can argue your stock holdings and whatnot still have some level of intrinsic value, but a house is a house like they're absolutely is intrinsic value there. Now, a quick side note, I live in San Diego, as we've talked about it. And you said that you bought a house for like 85 grand.

Give you a headstate. That was literally a friend of mine called and was like, yo, I was going to list this property, but my lender, it's private lender needs his money back by this date. I'm not going to have it done by that date. There's no way it'll sell. Can you close? And I was like, yeah. And then. I'll say it. So we agreed to 85. And I was like, write the contract for",

And so I'm in for, you know, the closing costs. I don't necessarily think that's the way you should do it with everything, but you know, if you've got a good relationship with the seller, they're willing to kind of play the game. You can kind of just manufacture a closing. So that's what we did. I mean, it's logical as far as I can tell, and it's most of the better deals and real estate that I've experienced have actually come across more like that, especially the liquidity aspect. I find that if you can find opportunities to provide liquidity for somebody, you can typically typically get in at a much better price.

And that one just kind of happened like. I don't know if he mispriced or if it was because of COVID, I mean, he, he priced that thing at, I think I bought it at 88,000. It was a pretty nice duplex. I mean, it was nicer than the one I bought for 79, 9, 2 years prior. So, and it was worth more than that. I mean, took put in perspective, I bought it for. I don't actually remember. I think it was like 88 and I sold it for one year and one day later. So I didn't have to pay short term capital gains for 140. And so, and I didn't do anything to it maintenance wise. I mean, it was like routine, you know, touch ups, but the same tenants were in it that I sold it that were in it when I bought it. So. That's probably what I think.

So you want to look at like your rent price ratio. So I would look at tenant landlord laws. So I would stay red state.

Yeah, there's I'm trying to think back to like my super macro micro market stuff.

And it's like, oh, well, all right, cool. What kind of properties do I want? And there's, you know, there's no right answer. Crack houses are great. If you have no money and you have all kinds of time, you can buy them dirt cheap people will give them to you low down, you know, lease option, stellar finance, all the things. And you'll get a really good return on your rent. You're going to have higher maintenance, higher tenant issues, higher vacancy deal with a bunch of bullshit. But if you have time and no money, that's a great way to start. And then what happens is most people get to a place where they all of a sudden find themselves with money and no time. And they start selling the crack houses and moving south and buying more, you know, decent property. So I would say, you know, really just figuring out what neighborhoods are good. And you can actually you can go in and you can zip code. Different population stuff and figure out like where people are moving to where people are moving from. Crime maps and all that I would I would really just want to know, you know, if I buy this house, am I in a war zone because you don't want to be. Now that",

Crime maps and all that I would I would really just want to know, you know, if I buy this house, am I in a war zone because you don't want to be. Now that would be the basic stuff. And then I would start interviewing property managers and honestly the property manager will be able to tell you very quickly like what neighborhoods. I know occupancy expectations rent expectations and all of that and they'll have recommendations for you. I know my property manager is one of very few who will actually touch like war zone north side properties, which has been great because I'll introduce friends to her. But she's also very upfront with me like I'll call her even now. I'm like, hey, Jerry, do you like this neighborhood? She's like hell no, okay. I'll stay away from that. I learned that lesson the hard way. I would start networking with real estate agents local networking like investment Facebook groups, property managers. And then I think the last piece of that puzzle would probably be the lenders looking for you can go find a national bank or hard money lender. But if you find a local.

I had I got a PRK like LASIK that day like I promoted and then went and got LASIK or PRK and while I was recovering I grew the mustache and when I had grown it out as like a Lance Corporal you know deployment or corporal is always somebody gave me shit it was like this thing you know first started.

Yeah so one of the questions I got from my audience for you specifically and it's honestly to near not insult you it's not for you specifically but it's for real estate general and you do real estate which is. Current rate environment lot of people are turned off from just transactions right now because rates are high. What do you think about that notion and how do you get around it. I think people have been finding a reason to be turned off from real estate investing since I started like 2017 the market was in a crash 2018 the market was in a crash 2019 the market was way too high",

I'm locked and everything else goes up property value rent you know whatever now that the normally when rates. Go up property values hold or or dip they didn't dip at all so my my spitey sense is telling me that when rates drop which will eventually happen at some level all these people who have been holding out might actually move because right now there's a lot of people locked into their.

Flat toad for like the last year and a half over rates and inflation definitely hasn't gone away so like they're either gun up stay there or they're going to go up if rates so it's. So I feel like all of that is true but I mean I to really just boil it all down I would rather. Pay more for a rate then pay more for a house so do I like the environment of really low interest rates yeah but I'd rather pay for current pricing with high rate and then be able to refi into a lower rate then pay. Potentially more just have a lower rate and you're like what's the difference well like the rate changes without affecting the property like if I buy a house for a hundred thousand dollars and the rates 9 and the rate goes to 3 still about that house for 100 grand i'm not under water i'm okay long as I don't miss",

Well now I'm under water for a long time and I'm stuck and so you know there's a lot of other stuff to it to like. Rates you know put this puts like we're not in a buyer's market or a seller's market right now so like people can't get their house to sell as quickly on the mls which provides a lot of other unique opportunities like. You know seller financing stuff and there's all kinds of interesting ways to play that game we just sold an apartment complex for probably 50 thousand more than what we would have been able to sell it for because we agreed to hold the note for two years and we.

It's pretty awesome I think you things the first thing is I think you did a good job really good job explaining the high rate environment because what I try to explain to people is the basis the basis doesn't adjust until another transaction the interest rate is variable essentially you can have different access to change your rates so I think the way you describe that was awesome but the other thing that you're highlighting here that is really cool and one of the things I find interesting. So I think the thing about real estate is it's very flexible there are a million different ways you can cut even one single deal it can be done a lot of different ways when you think about your progression through real estate would have been some of those more pivotal moments when you realize it's not this standard cookie cutter I go through an agent there's 3 commission on both side yada yada like just standard transaction what are some of the things that you can do.

Like shit let me get out of this thing with real estate there's not a whole lot of mistakes that can't be overcome by just holding on to it for a longer period of time so like I lost 20 grand on this flip that's okay eventually the house will be worth more as long as I'm not coming out of pocket every month to hold on to the thing it'll be fine it'll buff and so I really like that it's a very forgiving asset class as long as you're at a market that's not plummeting and even then if you had bought your hand.

And so I was like you want mine like I'm thinking about getting rid of it I was like it says it's blue booked at this and he texted back yeah do you want to be the bank and like that's a normal conversation for us like most people I'd say I want 8000 and the or 6500 whatever and they would say okay let me get alone or let me pay you off in cash or whatever and his immediate thought was. Can I make payments to you like I'll pay a little more if I just make payments to you and it's like that's just a way of thinking right and so the number of houses I probably bought 15 20 25 houses now where the bank was either not involved at the beginning or not involved at all because of just negotiating with sellers and just asking questions you know hey how much do you need to get out of this house today okay I can put that down. If I put that down what if I just make these payments for the next 10 years I like okay you know or or all kinds of crazy ways so I would say",

He's gonna he found the deal he's operating the deal he's managing the renovations on the deal he needed 200,000 to make it happen I pinged one friend he said yes I'm a 35 owner of this transaction the friend who said yes doesn't want equity he doesn't want to deal with a K1 like a tax return issue he just wants monthly payments whatever so I was like hey can you do 24 months pay you 1 up front",

And so that dude is going to make you know math and public 22,000 on his 200k guaranteed by backed by the properties he's going to be first position lean. Herb no yeah yeah first position lean and then we're going with all the renovations we'll refinance we'll pay him out we'll have it on a bank loan and we'll be into the property for effectively zero money out of pocket. But you know costs us 22,000 an interest to do that and good relationships but I'd rather do that than put 200k in it myself i've got you know other places to stash money. What's inside the bike yeah like the networking and learning about private money and seller financing are huge ways to change the game because you're not using a bank you're not using credit you don't have to abide by any of those rules you can just if you understand terms you can literally do anything you want.

But I mean I would I would essentially like when I was wholesaling I had a wholesaling company for probably two to half years and at the end of it we were doing four transactions a month all off market we we generally wholesale two or three and then flip one and hold one or whatever you know however the math worked out. And I literally had probably six guys that would get a text message hey I got this property coming I'm looking for this here's what I've got for you know after repair value renovations you know do your own homework here's a link to the photos 24 hours later the other 1200 investors on my email list would get it if none of them would bought it and it was very common that that never saw the email list and you know most of the big wholesalers I know have five or 10 minutes of the time I'm going to do that. Five or 10 like main buyers. And then after that they go somewhere else and you're like well that's not fair is it get a hold of the guy's like go let me be on your main buyers list I'll show you I'm worth it. And I like how I buy a fucking property you send me a deal buy this out of a bitch as long as it makes sense or I'll tell you what",

All right you can go sit in the email list but if someone on that email list buys property buys another property like you you very quickly you're on top of my list and you're going to get the deals before anyone else and you know whatever that looks like doesn't mean you have to buy everything that comes in front of you by any means but if I don't believe you're going to close. Or like if you fall out on a contract I want to say you're dead to me but you definitely aren't seeing things first. Yeah well and it's it's a working relationship right it's like this it's the same thing if I do anything else I'm going to look for the people that are performing at the same level as I am or maybe even a little bit higher and get around those people so I think we were highlighting there is kind of a really important point now when you're looking at different properties it sounds like you still do",

Just to couch that some people when they hear commercial they sometimes think forget that there's like an entire fucking umbrella under commercial there's a million things under there I people say like because they know I'm in. Crean they'll say stuff like oh well isn't commercial going to collapse and it's like what does that even mean like what is that even mean like all commercial real estate across the entire globe is just going to like no dude it's not this works just as residential housing markets have pockets right like California tends to do its own thing so when you look between the different asset classes and feel free to take the commercial side whatever you know path resonates with you but how do you view the difference between those two and how do you end up.
