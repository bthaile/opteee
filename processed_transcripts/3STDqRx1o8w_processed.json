    "text": "what's up outliers let's talk about building a trade log if you've heard me on YouTube at all I've talked about this because it is one of the most important things you can possibly do as a Trader so I'm going to walk you through a process of what this whole thing is how it looks and why you should consider it and then I'm going to walk you through an actual example in Google Sheets right now so you can see exactly how to go about building your own now a couple things the first thing is one of the absolute best outputs of building a trade log is the process of building it it's the same thing for building a trading plan the process of building of the log is really useful because it brings you closer to your strategies closer to the information and it makes you think analytically and forecast the kinds of things that you might want to track the other thing about building a trade log is you don't need to have the final solution to start my trade log continues to evolve I just wrapped up my 18th year of trading I went through a phase where it was handwritten then I realized handwritten kind of sucks because you can't conduct data analysis on it so then it went into manual input but that kind of sucked because it was taking me a long time to input all the things that I was",
