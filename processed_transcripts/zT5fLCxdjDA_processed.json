We have a lot to look at today. I want to go through the market with you all. Take a look at some options. See what's going on out there. I do want to highlight this new addition to the art collection. This is a piece of scrimshaughts like 2000 year old wall wrist tusk that they chisel into. I can show you a close up of it. Super, super cool. But that goes pretty well with the old mammoth tusk. So apparently your boy just likes old stuff because that is slowly what is being accumulated behind me. All right, let's get into it. First, you know, I will share another piece of the trip. This was a helicopter tour, a book for us of Bear Glacier that actually included a landing. This was a private tour, which is pretty cool. We had a chance to go check out the glaciers in a different kind of way. So I'll let's play for you. It's like 15 seconds. So essentially we do some laps around up on the glacier here. And then you can actually see where the glacier is feeding into this lake. I've learned that it's called calving where the glacier breaks off and falls in to make those big ice cubes. I",

I've learned that it's called calving where the glacier breaks off and falls in to make those big ice cubes. I got a bunch of pictures of those and drone footage down there. That's really, really cool. And then we ended up flying down this way. And then we've landed the helicopter somewhere over here kind of on the bank. I had a chance to fly the drone a little bit, you know, check out the glaciers a little closer. Overall fantastic experience. I show you guys this stuff because for me, this is this is literally all part of the power through training. None of this was even on my radar for the vast majority of my life. And the funny thing about this helicopter tour is we didn't even really book it ahead of time. We were just figuring out what we were going to do that day based on some last minute change of plans and we're like, this looks cool. And the ability to just go book this because it looked cool is something I never would have expected. And I think it's really cool.

And this is what I try to remind people is that for me, trading is interesting. The markets are interesting. However, the real enjoyment again for me is outside of markets when I can withdraw my money and go do stuff like that with it, which is really neat. So I like sharing that with you all to kind of balance out the doom and gloom side of things because I am quite a bit of a realist and trading is hard work. But there are really cool benefits to it once it's figured out. So that's that. All right. Now for those interested, when I get the drone video I'll put up, I can share a Google Drive link for those that want to check that out. I did one for Iceland, which is really, really fun. I don't think I posted the Norway one, which is also really cool. Maybe I'll get that up for you guys if you're interested. The drone stuff is just kind of neat.

I haven't looked at this yet. So I am getting caught up real time with you. All this will be a chance for us to see kind of what's going on together. So when I look at the 12th, I see, oh, peck, I see inflation expectations, which that metric I am interested in. And here we go. This is really where things are going to start getting spicy. Is this block here on the 13th and the 14th PPI CPI month over month, year over year? It feels like these metrics just keep on coming out, but they do. And they're super important. Right now the market is at, in my opinion, such a delicate balance. The fact that when we take a look at, let's go into the flexible grid. Let's take a look at this.

So it's not blocked out by noise. Although the feats are up just a little bit right now with VIX down about 1.74. So I'm coming down a little bit. VIX coins down two and three quarters percent, pretty significant actually. So anyways, sidetrack aside, this is interesting to me. The fact that the market sold off this heavy and then had this kind of rebound. So let's talk about that. When I see the market get to these nosebleed levels, I expect to sell off sooner or later just normalization of price, taking profits like all of that is so normal. Then the market needs to fall enough to get to a point where people are interested in transacting again, buying. And that started happening here. You can see this volume notice really, really deep actually. And then it fell off a cliff. This downside move was pretty severe. And this was driven by a bunch of different things. The bank in Japan, they had that unexpected rate cut, or I'm sorry, rate high, you cannot cut wrong way.

Those kinds of things really start to shake things up against the broader perspective of what's going on on the US side of things, which is we're still in inflationary period. Inflation is still elevated. We still have high rates. We still haven't seen a cut. And things are starting to show cracks. We're seeing unemployment numbers coming in, not in line with expectations. We're seeing different economic efficiency indicators and just overall production indicators not coming in line with expectations, really causing people to take pause and say, okay, this actually looks kind of not good. Now we finish this sell off. We get a low of 510 after literally two days before we're hanging around like 550. And then it starts rowing all the way back up to 532. This was looking at spy. So why am I going into all this preamble? It's because I think this is showing you how delicate the market is and just how much this kind of information can have an outsized impact on what the price looks like in the short term.

So I do believe it's extremely resilient. That doesn't mean in the short term, I can't look pretty nasty. And I think that that's quite likely. The reason why I think that's quite likely is we have to also take a look at the divergence now between spy and the Russell, meaning small cap stocks. Take a look at small cap stocks here. They recovered as well, but this small cap move does not look like what you see over here in the large caps. And that's an important note. So to me, it still looks like small caps are under a bit of pressure. They essentially gave up everything that gave us. This was actually really interesting series of trades for me because I played the majority of this run up via ratio called Agnoles and I got chopped up in here. I got stopped out a few times.

I tried to reenter, got stopped out because I thought we were getting closer to the ultimate move that I expect occurring and then it did not occur just yet at least. And well, I guess it kind of did and then it undid itself, I should say because this is a massive move. This is one of the largest moves the Russell has seen in this reference time frame, but then it gave it all up. And if you take a look, essentially it fell pre up move levels. So I still view small caps as kind of the Canary in the coal mine. And if we can't see small caps in a healthy place operating well, that tells me a lot about the broader economy. Now notice if you were called during some of the update videos I did while I was on my trip, I was really keying in on how these different days mirrored one another across the indices. They look so similar. Right. But the fifth, if you look at spy cues or I W M, it looks so similar in terms of the price performance. Then if you look at this, the sixth, very similar seventh, so on, eighth, so on. And then the ninth, what happens on the ninth divergence? We see S and P cues",

But it is starting to flag the conversation of recession. And again, I'm not here to try and scare people or make people feel good. I try to look at things objectively. And it's very clear to me, at least, that we are not out of the woods yet that the probability of a recession in my opinion is actually expanding the longer that this goes as it is.

And we see that starting to come into light here where if we take a look at the Fed watch tool and we take a look, let's look at the comparison and we take a look at 18 set. Notice we're at 100 probability of an ease. That's already a change from a month ago where there was a 7 probability of no change, not massive, but still enough that it's worth noting. This is really what's different. The probability of a larger cut is expanding pretty meaningfully. Now this just waffled back. This was a much weighted probability of a 50 basis point cut. Now it's looking like a quarter point, which again, it's just kind of interesting to see with where we're at now and how this is starting to line up. I think most people are of the opinion that the Fed is late and it's really easy to cast stones and throw at the Fed. But when I'm looking at the bond markets, I'm looking at just the way that the market is doing. I'm looking at earnings, which is highly, highly informative.

If you'll notice in the newsletter, there's really strong performance on a relative basis for SP 500 companies, big companies. They're doing okay and they tend to do okay in these kinds of markets. But again, this is why it's so important to have a slightly diversified view of markets and include things that also flash us some different perspectives. A.K.A. The Russell really helps with that quite a lot. So if we take a look at Russell year to date, I mean, we're essentially hanging right around. We're like within five, six points of where we opened on the year, which is crazy. This essentially hasn't moved. So all of this is to summarize. I think we are at a capitulation point. I think that the market is going to be heavily, heavily sensitive to information coming out like this, PPI, CPI, month of or month of year over year. I think those data points are really, really important. I also think jobless claims, really big deal, retail sales, really, really big deal. All of these standard inflation slash economy metrics that we've been using as a proxy are now I think under a microscope.

Now one thing I will say is I don't necessarily see this same downside profile from here. The main reason is because we've already had a decent size sell off from being up at five, 65 now down to five 30 in the SP 500 specifically in spy. So this drop can be a little more aggressive when you're at what I would call nose bleeds highs, like really, really high on a relative basis near term highs. But you can see that we're falling into these value areas where people really were stepping into buy. So if I move my head out of your way and you look at this giant down day here, look at the buyers that stepped in. We had massive, massive overall volume show up here, which was people just saying, okay, yeah, sell off got it. But I really like this here long term. That's mostly the positioning that you see there. This is not retail traders. I mean, of course, retail traders are mixed into this, but retail traders are not moving our volume from an average of 57.6 million shares a day to 146 million shares per day.

We went through a couple quarters not too long ago or just seemed like everything I was trading was going way off into this new unfounded territory. But it seems like we're getting back into standardized profiles. That's what's earnings are looking like to me coming up this week. Now, I did get a couple questions about a few other names. One of them was a question about, let me grab it specifically. We were looking at SoFi. So let's take a look at SoFi quickly. This is for Oscar from the Discord. And he's asking about a ratio called Agnol, which this is a no go for me. It's literally as simple as it's going down. So yeah, I mean, there's essentially absolutely no, no other work required for me here. Like it's in a downtrend. Again, does that mean that it can't go up? Does that mean that this down move was overdone and it can't go up from 664 to 733? No, it can. Well, one, that's a tiny move that I'm not interested in. And two, again, it just has the broader wind in its face, not at its back. Like this does not look very interesting to me to the upside. Again, totally can go up. I wouldn't surprise me if we saw some sort of return to value up towards this point of control to be completely honest. But the other assessment I have to make",

I wouldn't surprise me if we saw some sort of return to value up towards this point of control to be completely honest. But the other assessment I have to make is based on this movement, it looks like it's building a floor and somewhere around here, like 628, 632 ish. So the downside is generally limited. But the upside target that I would have would be somewhere right around this point of control, which essentially going from 664 to 730 is just not an interesting move to me. I would want to see something that offers more movement than that. So yeah, I don't like it for a ratio called diagonal personally. That would be a absolute pass. The other question we got from the discord is from Rath asking about the VIX. And we're, they're asking a lot of altilities been pulled out of the market with no new money flow coming in. Could that suggest that we're starting to lean more bearish? Sort of, it absolutely could. But I mean, the VIX itself is also coming down. Right? The VIX is not at this crazy high elevated level anymore. It's kind of at a, what I consider to be a generally sad level for where I would love to see it. We zoom this out.

So I'm not sure that I think much about actually that money flow argument. I again would argue kind of the opposite. So if we go back to spy, take a look at the volume on this day. Again, this is that day I was showing you where it had massive, massive overall volume, 146 million volume. And I'm highlighting the tip of that volume node for you guys in this little tiny graph. You're looking back five years. This was higher volume with 51 of that volume being by volume. And you don't really see that volume until you get back over here, which was another dip that was heavily bought. So I'm not really convinced on the money flow thing. It really, if you're using like a money flow index, depending on what kind of oscillator you use, it's going to look at this differently. But I'm just looking at the gross movement of shares.

So I'm looking at 640,000 calls against 334,000 puts. So still calls you still a little bit lighter than what it typically would be for a really bullish configuration. But this is still noteworthy. I don't want to diminish the fact that it's almost two to one here. That's pretty meaningful. But when we see GameStop in like a really bullish configuration, it'd be like really, really high. So I'm not necessarily seeing that. Now when I look at this coming expiration cycle, we do have a pretty stacked options chain. Now the 24 and a half are really light. But other than that.

But it could be if there is a lot more activity, but it just seems like it would probably be fairly quiet as far as I can tell. Now the other thing I wanted to touch on quickly was chewy. I had a couple questions on this. And one thing I did look up is for the 13G that Roy and Kitty filed. If he wanted to trade, if we, you know, are postulating whether he's in or out, he would have to file an amendment to the 13G if his position fell below the reporting threshold. So we know at least up until now that the position is still on to some degree. And we still don't fully know if he's using options or shares. It seems like shares is my best guess. But we just can generally postulate that he's still in it. Now whenever the transaction happens, I think there's a 10 day window or so. You guys probably know that a little better than me. I don't want to give you bad information this way. I think it is about a 10 day window from the day that the change happens. So it could have happened eight days ago. And then we wouldn't know until the filing if you waited the full 10 day period in order to file it. But it does look like he's still there. The",

And then we wouldn't know until the filing if you waited the full 10 day period in order to file it. But it does look like he's still there. The reason why that matters is because there is a reality where Roy and Kitty is a catalyst. It's crazy to say that that an individual trader is a catalyst, but he is. And what he doesn't game stop does serve as a catalyst for movement. I still don't necessarily think that he's pivoted away. It doesn't seem like he's turned his back on the stock at all. I guess he's just kind of exploring the space. He's looking around the dance floor and he's playing things as he sees it. It seems like based on all of his social media history and everything he's done previously, it doesn't seem like he's fully pivoted. At least I wouldn't think that to be the case until I saw something definitive, meaning something directly from him. But until then, to me, it just looks like he's kind of playing opportunities as he can find it, which makes again, from a trading perspective, it makes a lot of sense. And it looks like he's trying to play a lot of structural behavior. There was some interesting call activity that we reviewed already in Chui. And what that means for Chui, we don't know yet.",

There was some interesting call activity that we reviewed already in Chui. And what that means for Chui, we don't know yet. But to me, it looks like it's starting to run right up against near term resistance, which would be right about there. And the reason why I say that is because it's right on this next volume node, the next resistance would be down a little bit further. It would be like right here off of this volume node there. So it's 24 handle looks like the next general area of congestion that it's going to be bumping up into. So we'll see how it runs from there. But this is kind of in a different configuration, right? It's above the point of control. It still has volume coming in that's generally long volume. So if we look at the eighth, it was 99 by volume. It's a lot of by volume, which is generally interesting to me. When we look at the options chain, I see 256,000 calls against 1.4,000 puts. So way, way less variance between call put, ally, and their calls are kind of all over the place, right? You can tell by all these different colors, which represent these different explorations.

You can tell by all these different colors, which represent these different explorations. It's kind of a mixed bag as far as I see it. So we're going to keep an eye on it. The other thing to note though is that earnings is coming up. And that was my best guess for that trade that I saw on chewy because it was four right after earnings, if I'm not mistaken. So to me, again, it makes total sense if you want to trade earnings in chewy to build a position that essentially expires right after it's on the 28th and it's before the market. So you can gain exposure right around this earnings release. And that seems to be what that position was, but we'll find out soon enough. So quick kick off to the start of the week. We have a bunch of stuff to look at. All of the live streams are back online. I'm going to keep up with Newton to see if we're going to do the GME live stream on Saturday. If we are not, I might shift it again to Thursday and just do another solo one where I kind of flounder around by myself with the help of you all to help me figure out what I should be looking at and continue learning.
