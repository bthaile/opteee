And thankfully, because I started doing a little bit of homework on a tweet that somebody tagged me in. Where is it? This one. Let me show you guys. So there was my mind of my business, chilling. And then I was tagged by that hell of a long, I'm going to just go with TJ. TJ is pretty brief. So just go to TJ. There's a lot more numbers though. And TJ was seeing if we could take a look at it. And the answer is absolutely. I am infatuated with learning more about markets and pretty much everything I can get my hands on. And I have a deep appreciation for anybody that puts anything together that's even moderately well developed because it takes a lot of time and effort. So it is super clear that as I pop this open, I didn't go through it yet at all. But one thing I can say is it is not a brief document. It's 44 pages. So it tells me somebody put time into this. And I immediately treat that with respect with respect because especially looking at something like GameStop, there are so many theories, so many avenues twists and turns that make it pretty difficult to truly identify what's going on. And I'm always eager to see what people are",

And I immediately treat that with respect with respect because especially looking at something like GameStop, there are so many theories, so many avenues twists and turns that make it pretty difficult to truly identify what's going on. And I'm always eager to see what people are digging up. Now a couple admin notes. I approach this kind of stuff with a really poor version, like a semi varied version of the scientific method. And I try to look for in the military, we would refer to them as capabilities, critical vulnerabilities, centers of gravity, that those are just terminology frameworks in my mind, centers of gravity are things that really bolster the concept or the thing, critical vulnerabilities are gaps, things that we're taking leaps to come up with what we might be thinking is going on. And I try to look at it as objectively as possible. And something like GameStop has a lot to it. So all that aside, I am very much a trader. So there's two parts of my brain's brain when I look at this. There is the part that is looking for how do I trade this thing? And then there's the part that is just interested in how this thing behaves and moves. And this is more to dive into the latter element.

People have asked me a bunch of times, especially people that are more familiar with more of my broader content, which is just about options trading. Why I'm so interested in GameStop. And I will always reiterate the point for everybody, because I think it's important to continue to promulgate this message. GameStop can teach you a lot about markets that you otherwise never would come across. And I know that from firsthand experience, it has taught me a tremendous amount. And I do not have even a monochrome of the answers, but I look to explore them with you all. So giant preamble aside, let us get set up on the main screen. And then we'll start digging into this bad boy. All right. Now I'm assuming I have to assume. I have to assume Newton has already looked at this. And I grabbed his Google sheet because he has everything that I can think of with respect to things about settlement, which I have to assume. That's what a lot of this document is going to be about settlement. Again, I haven't read through it yet. I'm just guessing because that seems to be the biggest focus that I find when I look at the computer, look in the community. So with that, with that, no, at least. Okay. Yeah. So Robert says yes,",

He's been spending way more time and effort looking into the dates, the relationship between dates. I won't hold a candle to what he can identify. I will do my best to see what I can see with my own eyes, hopefully offer a little bit of value for the broader analysis. But I absolutely think he will be the the main dude I would take a look at. Maybe even during this, we'll pull up a couple of his videos and just scroll through them because I respect his opinion on this stuff tremendously. All right. So let's get this thing started.

Captures you get plus two fake internet points because that was a massive recommendation. Shout out raptures. The reason I'm so stoked on this is because this I have in my Google Drive, I have links to hundreds of different studies about things that impact settlement, GameStop, SEC, filings. So I will be able to query this against all of that, which I'm pretty excited about. Let's see what we see from a high level overview first. So from a settlement perspective, it says explains the basics of settlement theory. Well, you expected to see this, including trade date settlement dates, different settlement rules defined by the SEC for those that are unfamiliar with what this all means. It is everything to do with FTDs and it does everything to do with moving the obligation to acquire shares around. So this is relationships between entities like market makers, authorize participants, stuff like that. This has explores an interesting finding about ETF in a no action relief letter.

So I assume this is what this is referring to. We're a market maker, software permission to use irrevocable ETF creation orders to satisfy FTDs. Okay. Oofing a term used to describe delayed settlement mechanism affecting stocks. GameStop runs are driven by catalysts and can be explained using two sets of settlement formulas, S final, S final. So T1 plus 2, that's initial settlement. T235C and 35C minus one. That'll have to do with the 35 day settlement cycle. And then T3 plus 2, I imagine that's moving back to an authorized participant potentially. So I think this is talking about the bouncing of settlement requirements, essentially kicking. This is like the kicking the can idea as far as I could tell. Again, we'll get way more into details. I crack into this thing. This is just at a super high level overview based on two sentences that I'm seeing. So I can be 100 wrong. I want to be super clear.

This is funny because Newton and I a long time ago we were talking about RexO6-9. So I don't know much about this one. Discusses margin deficiencies, specifically O6-8 detail explanation of margin margin deficiencies, how they are calculated, explains how RexO6-8 allows firms to request extensions of time for satisfy margin deficiencies, granting them in additional 14 days. Yep, that makes sense. So this is another exemption that's provided for entities. It's almost like extending a line of credit. Following along with this so far, I'm going to ask it another couple of questions once I get through all these. Analyze several GameStop runs, including the squeeze, the Fedwire, Mario Day run in the Wombo combo, contributing them to catalysts in their effect. Okay. Provides a detailed breakdown of each run, highlighting the role of essentially the... I don't know what this boofing term is. It's just like a redemption creation cycles.

Solves the emoji. I'm not going to lie. I'm actually very excited to see what this talks about with respect to this emoji timeline. I've seen so many people guessing at what this thing is. Revealing it as a countdown to potential MoAstates, July 3rd and 5th, 24. Really interested in that. The reason why I'm so interested in that is because that's so far out from now. Wait, does that mean 24, 25? I think this might mean 25. Cost and Chewy provides additional examples of runs on cost and Chewy, demonstrating, creation, redemption and O6-8 are not unique to GME. Highlights the rising floor pattern and cost suggesting it aligns with lock the float theory. Fascinating. The, I mean, for my understanding specifically with the involvement of cost and Chewy, I've always just took that as their part of the ETF creation redemption cycles. So if they're bundled in an ETF that is affected by the creation redemption cycle, now the one thing that I haven't done that we as a community have",

We can't just look at the names that were interested in. We can't just look at cost Chewy GameStop and say, okay, when we go through these ETF redemption creation cycles, do those move because if the theory holds, then it should broadly apply to most of the names in an ETF. Now, I would feel comfortable restricting it slightly, of course, because things like cost, Chewy GameStop, they're not mega cap stocks. I mean, GameStop is like a mid cap stock now, but I mean, generally we refer to them as small caps. So because of that, that's a big RFI request for information. That's like a big piece of homework that I think we have to do. So I'm actually going to take a couple notes here and create a little bit of a to-do list. All right.

Requel discusses the potential for a Requel. Another attempt at Mao-Az, based on recent events like DIVs, time, meme, and GameStop's Q3 earnings. What does this do? You can like click into it. Plies the creation redemption formula to predict future potential run dates based on these events. Okay. Reuterates the thesis that catalyst drive GameStop's runs and emphasizes the importance of understanding delayed settlement. Encourages readers to use information to level a plane field. I like that. So then the other thing we have to take a look at is a total list of expected delayed settlement catalysts, a total list, not the times where we think it worked. So that's the next piece of homework. Here a total list of expected delayed settlement, impacts, and track, GME, ETF, and FTD behavior. The reason why I bring that one up, is because when we did this, I did this with Newton a while ago, and we looked through a bunch of these.

That's not to say that it can't happen, but I'm saying that what Malas might look like might look different than the generalized concept of Malas and the heights that it could reach. So there could be different versions of what it ultimately ends up being. So that enters my mind because as I look at these different settlement dates and stuff with respect to shorts, it begs the question of again, what do we think the probability is that shorts are still open that they have not covered and to what degree is that the case? And I don't know the answer, I really don't know the answer, but it's important to identify that because that wide spread short component is the entire primary driver for this theory, which is being driven by settlement cycles.

Rule 204 requires a participant to deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a longer short sale transaction and any equity security by settlement date or to close out a FTD position at a registered clearing agency. The By borrowing or purchasing securities of a like kind quantity this part is so important and there's a reason why I'm taking the time to go through this with you all directly and it's because the the broad theory that we're trying to apply here literally hinges on all like all of this settlement component in timing. So the rules around the settlement and how they're followed or not followed or skirted around make this entire they literally make the entire theory. Now again to reiterate there's two elements to this. Trying to predict this from a trading perspective is very challenging I think at least. I think that from a trading perspective it's through much easier ways to try to play the moves in GameStop.

So from a trading perspective there's a much easier way to do essentially all of this in my opinion and so far it's been the case from my own experience but the settlement cycle rule abuse in way that ways that different entities skirt the rules are a bit of a different story and I think that they highlight a lot of broader structural and integral issues with markets that people should at least be generally aware of. Again from a trading perspective most of these rules don't really impact most of what we do. They don't but I think being aware of it is not going to hurt anybody and then if you're looking to trade things specifically that are the primary profit mechanism are these settlement cycles you have to understand it's literally the way that the trade is that thought to move.

Essentially provides a no action assurance means that the market participant X and corn sedited it up. Regarding specific. If the SEC grants the relief. This doesn't help me this is the wrong thing whatever Gemini. I'm just scrolling back through I had it before extrapolate out on all these to see what we can learn. Explain GameStop's price movements suggesting a link between delayed settlements and price surges I can see that. The 68 allows brokers to request extensions to meet margin calls potentially delaying the impact of market deficiencies in the market. Okay. This starts to confound things a lot. The reason why I think that this starts to confound things a lot is because if we look at oh 68 as it sits here. Then I don't see why the 35 day settlement cycle wouldn't often change based on people abusing this. So I don't see why they wouldn't abuse this. This is just the if these actions triggered margin calls the emoji timeline decoded by the author adds intriguing layer to the analysis hitting a potential coordinating trading activity.

I'm most interested in this. I'm not even going to lie. I'm probably going to go to that first and given to my immediate gratification desire. I'm so curious what they think about those. It seems so many versions of it. And none of them makes sense to me. ?? To some Wildebeest Cuts or to Livestream Where does it see perfectly is the volume of the stuff for the entire 14? I don't fully understand that. Nourts must have filed for a REX-068 extension. The fulfill margin. See, this is another part that starts to get really confounding to me. I think that we have to start differentiating between who the shorts are. Because if this makes me think that people think it's market-making firm that are the primary shorts and not entities like hedge funds of different sorts that like Citrone that are trying to short things. And the reason why that matters is because the way that the rule set is applied is very different depending on the entity. This confuses me because if there's a margin deficiency and they file REX-068 extension, I don't understand why they would go to the stock now and drive the volume. That doesn't make sense to me.

And I would love to know why that wouldn't happen based on this theory. I genuinely would because obviously from this person's perspective, there has to be a logical reason why the participant wouldn't do that. I just don't know what it is because from my perspective, if we're saying the market makers as entities are essentially not touching the stock and we're transacting via swaps and we're transacting via ETF creation redemption cycles so that we don't have to touch the stock. I don't understand why they're touching the stock here. This is the exact time you don't want to touch the stock. So that part, I just don't fully follow.

Now I also want to be very clear. That doesn't mean that I don't think that market makers might have short GameStop positions. I genuinely have no idea. But when I look at this, it looks like so much of this is based around the market maker as the primary short participant. And maybe it's just a differing in general premise. But I would imagine it's closed and hedge funds because they're the ones that have the best access to black box movements to hide things and to not go on open market to grab shares like this. So that that part just really, really confuses me. Hold on, Newton texted us. Newton says, honestly, it's sort of reiterating the ETF can kick in the thing we talked, yeah, yeah, the thing we talked about before 15 day to 40 windows and 10, 11 day settlement periods.

Dude, so glad you said that because as I started reading it, I'm about 40 men in and that's exactly what I'm seeing. My question though, is who do we think the primary shorts are market makers for hedge funds? Asking because the settlement cycle ideas would apply differently to the participant. And also, I'm struggling to understand why in what is this Rexosix 8, Rexosix 8, we think that's driving volume on the open market to satisfy the margin requirement. Okay. This is if any of you guys were to ever go through my text conversations with Newton, it's strings of shit like that that I was just uttering into the mic. He and I spent so much time just pondering this shit. We're both equally interested in it. I'm curious what he thinks about that stuff though, like genuinely. Because I'm assuming it's something that we've thought about in that there's some sort of explanation that exists for it. I just literally don't know what it is. So I am pretty confident though that we'll be able to figure it out. So that's one of the questions I have here. So I'm actually going to add that to my to-do list.

Sadly, we'll never know if he was planning to shake his eight ball and exercise is 120,000 calls on stream that day. Well, we kind of know this because he he didn't have the money to exercise them. So we do know that he wasn't going to like he absolutely could exercise a lot of him. He had tons of money in the account, but he definitely couldn't have exercised all of them. Joseph says, have you gave your outlook for the week? No. So that one will be that live stream is going to be at 1700. I have three live streams today. I have this one right now. We'll probably go for like another half hour or so.

And that's not that's like any stock. And I'm also going to ask Chatcha BT this. Why would a market maker potentially want to remain systemically short a specific stock? Let's see what this is. Providing liquidity, managing inventory risk, that's not it. Exploding or evaluation or mispricing, I think they would have gotten out by now facilitating hedging for other market participants. That's the most likely so far. I think that's probably the best. That's the best concept for that that I can think of. Because it depends on hold on. So it depends on how far into the weeds we're trying to go here. But if we think that there are market makers that are potentially so far in bed with some hedge funds, then there could be like that that motivation for a market maker to remain systemically short could be there. That is a huge leap, which is why and went and got the hat to big leap. But that is objectively a motivating factor that I could conceive of.

It's literally one of the largest market making firms that exists, thousands of names. They're going to provide markets on. So in order for them to find themselves in a margin call, they essentially would have need to completely mismanage risk on this individual position. And then they would have to have an entire book where nothing is offsetting any of the risk in that initial position in that other stock.

So their net exposure, once you consider both of these names, their net exposure is long four. Beta weighted deltas. So the main point I want you to take away from this is that it's not done in a vacuum. It's done in a giant bucket with a ton of shit going on behind the scenes. One of the important elements is the ability for positions to offset risk with one another when they're looking at the composite of the entire book, which is exactly how a market maker is going to look at their book. They're going to track the individual positions of course. But they manage the risk in the aggregate control of the entire book. So risk management literally is how a market maker extracts their edge from the market because they operate in a near frictionless environment. They don't make a lot of money for trade. But by providing liquidity through the bit ask spread and capturing that differential, that's how they make their money.

So all that being said, it's exactly exactly why you have to remember that they're not just making market on one stock and one stock only. They're making a market on a ton of different things that can have offsetting qualities. And it's why when you have a massive market maker like Citadel, the probability of them having to use Rex 068 or something like that would be very small likely. Now there could be strategic reasons why they might siphon out liquidity to do something like this. But we're getting like super niche at that point, not saying it could or could not happen. I'm not saying that they may or may not be implementing it. I don't know. I'm not there. But what I do know is that market makers operate like this. They're going to be making markets on tons of stocks. The stocks will be looked at individually and then also in the aggregate. And if the market maker is doing a good job managing their book, which is the entire way that they make their money, they then will have positions that offset one another so that they don't run into that situation where they have a margin call.

They would I just have such a hard time seeing why they would put themselves in that scenario. Okay. So Newton based on the okay. So let me explain the question I asked earlier. I said my primary thought though is who do we think the primary shorts are market makers or hedge funds asking because the settlement cycles would apply differently to the participants. I'm also struggling to understand why in Rex 068 we think that it's driving volume on the open markets to satisfy the margin requirements. Newton says great question. I had the same. And I believe this would be a powerful tool for designated market maker to handle CNS FTD settlement manate to manage large buy-ins over time. The margin deficiency could be the DMM specific account for that equity. So in this case Citadel in GME big buy aspirin for 50 day to for all. I see. Interesting. Interesting. I don't see that personally but again, I don't fucking know. Not gonna pretend to know. But I don't see how that logically would flow from their perspective. All right.

So so far though, if I were to summarize what I'm seeing, this does seem to be generally highlighting a lot of what Newton has been talking about, which has been the redemption creation cycles and kind of adding another perspective on it, which is great. I'm very, very excited to see this. So yeah, the, man, the movement in this has been really interesting. And from a recent timing perspective, it looks super solid. Let me message TJ really quick.

Data dropped on a Reddit post yesterday. Yeah, if you maintain, if you grab a link of it and you, you hold on to it, just let me know. And then we can take a look at it together. The problem with swaps, I will continue to reiterate is that us trying to do anything with swaps, it's good to know that they're there and that they how they work, but they're beyond that, they're generally meaningless. The reason why I say that is because they are the epitome of a black box. We have no idea what the structure of the swap is. They are negotiated between two parties. And the terms are not, we don't see them. They're it's a negotiated contract. It's a very sophisticated derivative in that it's not standardized. So the issue with swaps is this idea that as a big swap is coming due and people are going to have to go to the market to buy stuff, it doesn't fully hold because again, institutions are smart.

If I'm a, if I'm an entity that is on one end of the swap, that would lead me to have to go buy stock. Let's say that I was going to have to buy stock on this day. And let's say that the duration of the swap was this period. Do you think that I am going to wait until this day to buy the swap, to buy the underlying contracts that I would have to hold in order to satisfy my end of the swap? The answer is unequivocally no. You're not going to wait until the absolute last day to do something if you are planning to satisfy it in that manner, meaning to go to the open market to procure shares. It doesn't make sense. Because one, everybody can track it. We can see the dates of the swaps. So everybody can front run that move. That's, that's the whole point of a swap is for it to be non-standardized and more difficult to detect so that it can't be front ran. It's the same thing with dark pools.",

That's, that's the whole point of a swap is for it to be non-standardized and more difficult to detect so that it can't be front ran. It's the same thing with dark pools. The, the purpose of those is to attempt to obfuscate movement so that they can't be front ran. That's a big problem for people that are conducting really big purchases. So the scenario of somebody that knows that they're going to have to satisfy it by going to the open market and waiting until the very last day to do so it literally is not logical. I wouldn't do that as a lay retail trader. There's no way that super smart institutions are just like, oh yeah, fuck, this just came up on the calendar today. I guess I have to go slam the buy button on this thing all day today and try to get myself out of it. It just doesn't jive. The next element the more important element is as this contract is coming due they can write another one. There's, there are no rules so they can take the same contract they can say, ah, I still like this. I'm going to roll it out in time and they can do this as much as they want for whatever reason. We also don't know if there's not an early satisfactory component to the swaps where if",

So that's the that's the problem with swaps is that they are literal black boxes and it does not surprise me at all to see GameStop and a bunch of other stocks. Again, it's not just GameStop. There's tons of stocks like this that end up in swaps because it's really advantageous for people that are trying to do things with GameStop to use swaps to do them because they are a black box. So yeah, I would love to take a look at whatever the swap DD that came out from Arcagos but my expectation is that in terms of utility it will be quite limited for us and it's I would love for them to be more useful but I can definitely tell you I even on the livestream with PBISdom if I could take a look at the broader data set and see if I can come up with anything because I already know parts of what I'm going",

So for example, if I found some sort of correlation between a certain day of the week and something happened in the market and hint hint, I've done this before. I will use that. Do I fully know why the day of the week does something? Do I fully understand that the background behind it? More often than not know but it doesn't matter to me. I'm just trying to trade the effect.

Archduke PC says the swap dates have already expired. Correlated big GM, GME moves like May this year in the sneeze seat, but that's the problem is that we're what we're doing is we're overfitting at that point because guess also what happened during those periods supposedly, obnox tailwinds, settlement periods also happened. We also had massive options trading activity. We also now have apparently Rex 068. So the problem is what we're doing is we're looking historically at really strange scenarios and then we're trying to isolate what caused the scenario and in reality, it's overwhelmingly likely a contributing factor driven by a ton of this shit.

I've spent a long time looking at swaps because I find them very interesting and even if they have a 10 input potential into a model like this, I'm certainly interested in that. But based on the original analysis that I've done, I just hadn't seen a massive input personally, but definitely open to it. And I hope that there is because the more observable elements that we can clearly identify positive correlation with, then the more predictable the event becomes, which is literally good for everybody. It doesn't fall on deaf ears that I know so many traders are trying to use GameStop as a way to change their current life. Now, it's not my approach. I would love for them to have a different approach personally.

We're going to apply our thought process and our analysis to it as we should. But there's absolutely no reason why I would turn off an information source because what he does is at least researched and tracked. It's not completely random. Now it's the same thing I noticed with other people that I'll interact with. And you guys will hear me do this. I will say, is this something we can prove or is this a hunch or is this a theory? And the reason why I asked that question one is to check the framing of things so that people aren't misled. But the second is also to test the person. And how effective is the person at differentiating reality from something that we might think to be the case? Because something that we can objectively prove is different than a theory or something like that. So yeah, I totally dig new. I think he's rad. So yeah, I'm 100 going to ask his opinion on stuff like this, especially in things that I think he knows more than me for sure. And then I will always, I will always backcheck everything.

Matthew says you're a good person Eric never changed. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I hope to be. And I hope to continue changing. But hopefully for the better. Rapsha says even if Newton is wrong, it's how we learn, I agree. Newton's data isn't his theories could possibly be, but not the data he's noted. I don't know what that pertains to. Sorry, I probably move past it too fast. Notion says, is market energy me going to rip or crash on my Instagram question? We're actually going to take a look at that in a half hour. So on the 1700 live stream, I'm going to go through the market prep for the week. And then when I get back from traveling, what not, I'm going to start a daily live stream every single day for the YouTube channel. And then the outlier pro live streams will still be on Sunday and Wednesday. I might actually bump up the frequency and just cut back the time on some of the other ones so that we can cover a little disparate data because for the pro live streams, we",

And then working through individual people's trades as well to try and help. And then on the main channel, we do more broad analysis. We do scanning. We do like theoretical learning and stuff like that because I think that that's timeless applicable to everybody. And I my original objective for doing this whole thing is not changed, which is hopefully to spread and share information for people to arrive at their own conclusions for stuff. So thank you all for hanging out for being a part of the game. And also thank you for helping me learn. I enjoy this very much. I will see whoever wants to pop out for the market update or for the market outlook live stream in a half hour. We're going to look through the market as a whole, look through some news. See what's going on with the broad market. And then the pro members, I'll catch you all at 1730 to go through some portfolio updates and whatnot. So we are packed. We out here.
