The voice might sound a little bit weird. I think I have a little bit of canjure creature to style pointing out the surprise that maybe I have a little bit of congestion from traveling, generally feel okay. And thankfully, because I started doing a little bit of homework on a tweet that somebody tagged me in, where is it this one? Let me show you guys. So there was my, my business chilling. And then I was tagged by that hell of a long, I'm going to just go with TJ. TJ is pretty brief. So just go with TJ. There's a lot more numbers though. And TJ was seeing if we could take a look at it. And the answer is absolutely. I am infatuated with learning more about markets and pretty much everything I can get my hands on. And I have a deep appreciation for anybody that puts anything together that's even moderately well developed because it takes a lot of time and effort. So it is super clear that as I popped this open, I didn't go through it yet at all. But one thing I can say is it is not a brief document. It's 44 pages. So it tells me somebody put time into this.

And I immediately treat that with respect because especially looking at something like GameStop, there are so many theories, so many avenues, twists and turns that make it pretty difficult to truly identify what's going on. And I'm always eager to see what people are digging up. Now a couple admin notes. I approach this kind of stuff with a really poor version, like a semi varied version of the scientific method. And I try to look for in the military we would refer to them as capabilities, critical vulnerabilities, centers of gravity that those are just terminology frameworks in my mind, centers of gravity are things that really bolster the concept or the thing, critical vulnerabilities are gaps, things that we're taking leaps to come up with what we might be thinking is going on. And I try to look at it as objectively as possible and something like GameStop has a lot to it. So all that aside, I am very much a trader. So there's two parts of my brains brain when I look at this. There is the part that is looking for how do I trade this thing? And then there's the part that is just interested in how this thing",

People have asked me a bunch of times, especially people that are more familiar with more of my broader content, which is just about options trading. Why I'm so interested in GameStop. And I will always reiterate the point for everybody because I think it's important to continue to promulgate this message. GameStop can teach you a lot about markets that you otherwise never would come across. And I know that from first hand experience, it has taught me a tremendous amount. And I do not have even a monochrome of the answers, but I look to explore them with you all. So giant preamble aside, let us get set up on the main screen. And then we'll start digging into this bad boy. All right. Now I'm assuming I have to assume. I have to assume Newton has already looked at this.

So Robert says, yes, Newton reviewed it. Yeah. Okay. It makes perfect sense. I would appeal to Newton's understanding of this stuff over my own, specifically with respect to settlement and whatnot. He's been spending way more time and effort looking into the dates, the relationship between dates. I won't hold a candle to what he can identify. I will do my best to see what I can see with my own eyes, hopefully offer a little bit of value for the broader analysis. But I absolutely think he will be the main dude I would take a look at.

Raptures you get plus two fake internet points because that was a massive recommendation. Shout out raptures. The reason I'm so stoked on this is because this I have in my Google Drive, I have links to hundreds of different studies about things that impact settlement, GameStop, SEC, filings. So I will be able to query this against all of that, which I'm pretty excited about. Let's see what we see from a high level overview first. So from a settlement perspective, it says explains the basics of settlement theory. Holy expected to see this, including trade date, settlement date, different settlement rules defined by the SEC for those that are unfamiliar with what this all means. It is everything to do with FTDs and it does everything to do with moving the obligation to acquire shares around. So this is relationships between entities",

We're a market maker, saw permission to use irrevocable ETF creation orders to satisfy FTDs. Okay. Oofing a term used to describe delayed settlement mechanism affecting stocks. Game stops runs are driven by catalysts and can be explained using two sets of settlement formulas. S final, S final. So T1 plus 2, that's initial settlement. T2 35 C and 35 C minus 1. That'll have to do with the 35 day settlement cycle. And then T3 plus 2, I imagine that's moving back to. In authorized participant potentially. So I think this is talking about the bouncing of.

Speculates market makers using mechanic mechanism similar TTF creation approach. So this is the ETF creation redemption using ETFs that hold baskets. ETF holds baskets of different stocks. And you can the theory is you can use ETFs that hold something like GameStop to satisfy locates and stuff like that. So totally understand what they're talking about here. Rex O6-8. This is funny because Newton and I a long time ago we were talking about Rex O6-9. So I don't know much about this one. Discusses margin deficiencies. Specifically O6-8, detailed explanation of margin margin deficiencies, how they are calculated, explains how Rex O6-8 allows firms to request extensions of time for satisfying margin deficiencies, granting them in additional 14 days. Yep, that makes sense. So this is another exemption that's provided for entities. It's almost like extending a line of credit following along with this so far.

Examines, two big runs, and 24 associated with DFV's return, including Run, Lola, Run, and the DFV's return O6-8, Rex O6-8. It explains how DFV's return and trading activity triggered margin deficiencies in Rex O6-8 extensions leading to increased volume and volatility. Solves the emoji. I'm not going to lie.

Highlights the rising floor pattern and cost suggesting it aligns with lock the float theory. Fascinating. The, I mean, for my understanding specifically with the involvement of cost and Chewy, I've always just took that as their part of the ETF creation redemption cycles. So if they're bundled in an ETF that is affected by the creation redemption cycle, now the one thing that I haven't done that we as a community have to do is we have to look at the other names in those ETFs. We can't just look at the names that were interested in. We can't just look at costs, Chewy, GameStop and say, okay, when we go through these ETF redemption creation cycles, do those move because if the theory holds, then it should broadly apply to most of the names in an ETF. Now, I would feel comfortable restricting it slightly, of course, because things like cost, Chewy, GameStop, they're not mega cap stocks. I mean, GameStop is like a made cap stock now, but I mean, generally we refer to them as small caps. So because of that, that's a big RFI request for information that's like a big piece of homework that I think we have to do. So I'm actually going to take a couple notes",

And evaluate moves, move time, move severity and timing. With respect to GME costs, Chewy. Got that down. All right. Requal discusses the potential for a equal, another attempt at MoAS based on recent events like DIVs, time, meme, and GameStop's Q3 earnings. What does this do? You can like click into it. Plies the creation redemption formula to predict future potential run dates based on these events. Okay. Reuterates the thesis that catalyst drive GameStop's runs and emphasizes the importance of understanding delayed settlement encourages readers to use information to level the playing field. I like that. So then the other thing we have to take a look at is a total list of expected delayed settlement catalysts, a total list, not the times where we think it worked.

And we looked through a bunch of these. And there are unequivocally instances where things absolutely line up very interestingly. But the last I looked, there was also a lot of instances where it didn't necessarily so. And again, the thing that's really important when we're looking at these theories is to try to test how robust they are. So then because that doesn't mean that the theory doesn't hold even if it's intermittent, it just means that we would want to treat it differently based on how robust it is. Like that's literally one of the basis of kelly sizing for a position. Now again, this is Eric taking it from the theoretical element back into the trading world, which again, informing position sizing based on this stuff. Okay. Get back into Gemini.

I'm just kind of validating what Gemini is telling us to make sure that Gemini is also at least moderately accurate. Pre date settlement dates T plus two. This will be probably T plus one now. But I think I'm assuming they're talking about the, the squeeze from early 2020. So that would mean this would apply 35 C. Okay. So this is calendar days. Settlement day plus. Okay. So they're using calendar days here. That's an important differentiation as well because a lot of the other settlement theories use different combinations of um um calendar versus trading days. You want to, yeah, so they're just using different settlement dates here. The 15 window settlement occurs throughout the end means that the settlement occurs throughout the entire duration of this range of dates. The 15 is not only pointing out the 15th day, but the entire range. Yep. Yeah. Okay. So they're capturing that new settlement after the change on 28 May's now T1 used to be T2. This is good. S1.

The short theory as I look at it historically back at 21, I can see what they're talking about, but I'm very curious how it applies today as things sit right now because the original premise of this is that we think Moas is going to happen or might there might be another version of it that might be close to Moas, but not quite, you know, because we also had a couple conversations that I still think are really pertinent for us to discuss internally, which is if structurally Moas was short-circuited last time, I don't see them allowing it to run further in the future. That's not to say that it can't happen, but I'm saying that what Moas might look like might look different than the generalized concept of Moas and the heights that it could reach, so there could be different versions of what it ultimately ends up being. So that enters my mind because as I look at these different settlement dates and stuff with respect to shorts, it begs the question of again, what do we think the probability is that shorts are still open that they have not covered and to what degree is that the case?

Now again, to reiterate there's two elements to this. Trying to predict this from a trading perspective is very challenging I think at least. I think that from a trading perspective it's through much easier ways to try to play the moves in GameStop. You'll never top tick or bottom ticket but if anybody has showed you that you don't have to do that it's the cat. You just have to be involved in it. So from a trading perspective there's a much easier way to do essentially all of this in my opinion and so far it's been the case from my own experience. But the settlement cycle rule abuse in way that ways that different entities skirt the rules are a bit of a different story and I think that they highlight a lot of broader structural and integral issues with markets that people should at least be generally aware of. Again, from a trading perspective most of these rules don't really impact most of what we do. They they don't.

But when I look at this, it looks like so much of this is based around the market maker as the primary short participant. And maybe it's just a differing in general premise.

My question though, is who do we think the primary shorts are market makers or hedge funds? I'm asking because the settlement cycle ideas would apply different differently to the participant.

So I'm actually going to add that to my to do list. For Rex oh six eight why do we think that the margin satisfaction activity would present on the open market versus a creation redemption cycle.

Now I think that there's quite a few holes in here with this and that doesn't mean that there's not answers to them. They're just questions that we would want to answer. And the reason why we want to answer those is because it's a big part of why this thing may or may not work in the way that we think it may or may not because we're essentially saying that the volume here is being driven by this margin deficiency satisfaction which I don't fully follow what I want to understand.

No. So that one will be that live stream is going to be at 1700. I have three live streams today. I have this one right now. We'll probably go for like another half hour or so. Then at 1700 I'm doing for everybody on the YouTube channel. The market outlook for the week to make sure that you all have your marching orders while I am out freezing and checking out the mountains and Calgary. And then at 1730 so half hour and we're going to switch over to the Patreon stream. And we're just going to talk about like portfolio positioning, answer specific questions and stuff like that. So the market outlook will be a little bit later. Matthew says she's got on happy holidays, Eric and everyone straight up. Thank you, Matthew and happy holidays to everybody else. Merry Christmas.

So I'm going to add that to my, I talk to him like once a month. So I have a list of questions that I ask him typically. And I'm going to ask the question. I'm going to ask him is why would market makers want to remain systemically short a stock? And that's not that's like any stock. And I'm also going to ask Chatcha, BT this. Why would a market maker potentially want to remain systemically short a specific stock? And let's see what they say. Providing liquidity, managing inventory risk, that's not it. Exploding over valuation or mispricing. I think they would have gotten out by now. Facilitating hedging for other market participants, that's the most likely so far. I think that's probably the best, that's the best concept for that that I can think of. Because it depends on, hold on. So it depends on how far into the weeds we're trying to go here.

Jonathan says isn't set at all both a market maker and a hedge fund definitely. The problem with that if we are applying that theory here is that they're not going to have margin issues.

I like how the bid and offer progressively got worse as I went on longer. Here's what happens. This is stock XYZ. This is stock ABC. This is stock 123. They're going to go through different order flows for each of these stocks. So this one they might buy. This one they might sell. This one they might sell. They're going to have a bunch of different, a bunch of different ones of these. What happens is at the end of the day, they're going to look at their whole book, the entire book, this entire thing. And they're going to say, what's it look like? What's up? The reason why this matters is because they're not always making markets on individual securities. It's actually rarely the case. So when we're talking about them going into especially talking about a company like Citadel, because Citadel, the market making arm is going to do this on thousands of stocks.

So in order for them to find themselves in a margin call, they essentially would have need to completely mismanage risk on this individual position. And then they would have to have an entire book where nothing is offsetting any of the risk in that initial position in that other stock. Because when we look at the entire basket of all of the stuff that they're holding at a given point in time, stock ABC might be beta-weighted as 10 spy deltas. It would never be done like this, but it's just for ease of an example. And then stock 123 might be beta-weighted as negative six spy deltas. So their net exposure, once you consider both of these names, their net exposure is long four. Beta-weighted deltas. So the main point I want you to take away from this is that it's not done in a vacuum. It's done in a giant bucket with a ton of shit going on behind the scenes.

They're going to track the individual positions of course. But they manage the risk in the aggregate control of the entire book. So risk management literally is how a market maker extracts their edge from the market because they operate in a near frictionless environment. They don't make a lot of money for trade, but by providing liquidity through the bid-ask spread and capturing that differential, that's how they make their money. So all that being said, it's exactly why you have to remember that they're not just making market on one stock and one stock only. They're making a market on a ton of different things that can have offsetting qualities. And it's why when you have a massive market maker like Citadel, the probability of them having to use Rex 068 or something like that would be very small likely. Now there could be strategic reasons why they might siphon out liquidity to do something like this. But we're getting like super niche at that point, not saying it could or could not happen.

And if the market maker is doing a good job managing their book, which is the entire way that they make their money, they then will have positions that offset one another so that they don't run into that situation where they have a margin call and then to which we might hypothesize that they're then forced onto the open market to satisfy this requirement. They would I just have such a hard time seeing why they would put themselves in that scenario. Okay. So Newton based on the okay. So let me explain the the question I asked earlier. I said my primary thought though is who do we think the primary shorts are market makers or hedge funds asking because the settlement cycles would apply differently to the participants. I'm also struggling to understand why in Rex 068 we think that it's driving volume on the open markets to satisfy the margin requirements. Newton says great question. I had the same.

Then I need to finish going through the rest of the DD library. And then, but I'm going to put those on pause to go through the rest of this, the big DD. And try to see what we can learn.

And the terms are not, we don't see them. They're in a go, it's a negotiated contract. It's a very sophisticated derivative in that it's not standardized. So the issue with swaps is this idea that as a big swap is coming due and people are going to have to go to the market to buy stuff, it doesn't fully hold because again, institutions are smart. If I, Eric, let's literally draw it out, as you all know, I am a, I'm a budding artist and I, I just need to draw. I think that that's what happens. I just have to let it out via drawing. If I'm a, if I'm an entity that is on one end of the swap, that would lead me to have to go buy stock. Let's say that I was going to have to buy stock on this day.

Do you think that I am going to wait until this day to buy the swap, to buy the underlying contracts that I would have to hold in order to satisfy my end of the swap? The answer is unequivocally no. You're not going to wait until the absolute last day to do something if you are planning to satisfy it in that manner, meaning to go to the open market to procure shares. It doesn't make sense. Because one, everybody can track it. We can see the dates of the swaps. So everybody can front run that move. That's the whole point of a swap is for it to be non-standardized and more difficult to detect so that it can't be front ran. It's the same thing with dark pools. The purpose of those is to attempt to obfuscate movement so that they can't be front ran. That's a big problem for people that are conducting really big purchases. So the scenario of somebody that knows that they're going to have to satisfy it by going to the open market and waiting until the very last day to do so it literally is not logical.

The next element, the more important element is as this contract is coming due, they can write another one. There are no rules. So they can take the same contract. They can say, I still like this. I'm going to roll it out in time and they can do this as much as they want for whatever reason. We also don't know if there's not an early satisfactory component to the swaps, where if the swap is originally this duration, but at this point, they're like, eh, let me get out of the swap.

So yeah, I would love to take a look at whatever the swap did that came out from archaegos. But my expectation is that in terms of utility, it will be quite limited for us. And it's, I would love for them to be more useful. But I can definitely tell you I even on the livestream with PBISdom, if I could take a look at the broader data set and see if I can come up with anything because I already know parts of what I'm going to find. I know that I'm going to find a entirely mixed bag of stuff. But if I can find anything with a decent correlation coefficient, I still would try to do something with that because why wouldn't we?

I'm just trying to trade the effect. Now you can go back later and figure out that some of it are window dressing effects. And there's other things that lead to behavior like that. But it typically doesn't last forever. It could just be that there's a specific fund that's trying to gain entry into something and they're scaling in over time or whatever the case is. The point I'm trying to make is that even if it's a loose correlation, it's still a correlation and it's something that we should take a look at. I got some in my eye. So I'm hopeful that with the swaps, we might be able to find something. I just don't know what. But I don't think that they're quite as informative, I think, as people are hoping for them to be.

Different elements of all of these things coalescing at a specific period in time. Markets are not vacuums. Markets will continue to be extremely complex places that will always have these quirky style movements because of that. Now again, we should always look at this stuff and we should look at swaps. I've spent a long time looking at swaps because I find them very interesting and even if they have a 10 input potential into a model like this, I'm certainly interested in that.

I would love for them to have a different approach personally. That's not to say don't trade GameStop, but I would just love for people to have a slightly higher probability approach to achieving that. But nonetheless, it is what it is.

So I have to do things in a way that work for me. But I recognize that other people have different imperatives and I see a lot of people trying to do something big with this and I want them to I want them to have a solid, a solid approach and something that makes sense for them. Star Beef, which is a hell of a name. Star Beef says, this is why I hope moving forward, you use less Newton texting. A lot of these debunked theories people are saying come from Newton. He still pumps T35 and daily emphasize emphasis on Max Payne. Oh, fuck no. There's a 0 chance that I'm going to use less Newton. It's an information source. He and I don't agree on all of the elements of GameStop. And that's okay. We don't have to. But the way that you move closer to objective truth is through multiple information sources. So as long as he still remains like the completely grounded awesome dude that he is, there's no reason why I would stop listening to his opinion of things. He's he literally in my opinion is like that the GameStop scribe. That's what I call him the GameStop scribe. And it's because he spent so much time",

He's he literally in my opinion is like that the GameStop scribe. That's what I call him the GameStop scribe. And it's because he spent so much time collating all of this different data about GameStop. So there's no way that I would turn down the intelligence that he can provide. But as you can tell, I don't take him at his word or anybody at their word. You shouldn't. You should do your own research. But it's like it's the same thing in the military. Like we wouldn't turn down any intel. We'll listen to all of it. We're going to screen it. We're going to apply our thought process and our analysis to it as we should. But there's absolutely no reason why I would turn off an information source because what he does is at least researched and tracked. It's not completely random. Now it's the same thing I notice with other people that I'll interact with. And you guys will hear me do this. I will say, is this something we can prove or is this a hunch or is this a theory? And the reason why I asked that question one is to check the framing of things so that people aren't misled. But the second is also to test the person. And how effective is the person at differentiating reality from something",

So yeah, I totally dig new and I think he's rad. So yeah, I'm 100 going to ask his opinion on stuff like this, especially in things that I think he knows more than me for sure. And then I will always I will always back check everything. You guys see me do that literally with everything because it's how I apply my process. So yeah. Yeah. Rapsh. Starbeef says this is why I hope I already read that. Matthew says you're a good person or you've never changed. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I hope to be. And I hope to continue changing but hopefully for the better. Rapture says even if Newton is wrong, it's how we learn I agree. Newton's data isn't his theories could possibly be but not the data he's noted. I don't know what that pertains to. Sorry, I probably move past it too fast.

So on the 1700 live stream, I'm going to go through the market prep for the week. And then when I get back from traveling what not, I'm going to start daily live stream every single day for the for the YouTube channel. And then the outlier pro live streams will still be on Sunday and Wednesday. I might actually bump up the frequency and just cut back the time on some of the other ones so that we can cover a little disparate data because for the pro live streams, we get more into like my specific portfolio actual trades trade adjustment stuff like that. And then working through individual people's trades as well to try and help. And then on the main channel, we do more broad analysis. We do scanning. We do like theoretical learning and stuff like that because I think that that's timeless applicable to everybody. And I my original objective for doing this whole thing is not changed, which is hopefully to spread and share information for people to arrive at their own conclusions for stuff.

So thank you all for hanging out for being a part of the game. And also thank you for helping me learn. I enjoy this very much. I will see whoever wants to pop out for the market update or for the market outlook live stream in a half hour. We're going to look through the market as a whole, look through some news. See what's going on with the broad market. And then the pro members, I'll catch you all at 1730 to go through some portfolio updates and whatnot. So we are packed. We out here. I'll see you all in a little bit. Be an outlier, be an ape, be an outlier, ape, be whatever makes you happy. I'll see y'all later.",
