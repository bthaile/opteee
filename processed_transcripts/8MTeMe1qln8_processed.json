And the entire premise for this entire conversation is that you have to, if even if you're in this stream, you have to think about shit differently. If we try to build something that the average person can do, well, never even, don't even bother talking about investing. The average person can't even save enough to have an emergency expense for like a 500 expense that pops up over the course of a month. Like that's average. So the context of realistic, I think, is super relative because I completely agree with you. The idea of like, well, the average person do that, absolutely not. But the average person also makes an insane number of very poor decisions that generally lead them to where they are. Circumstance has a role for sure. No doubt about it. But even with circumstance, there are decisions people can make to navigate a slightly different direction. But even to your point, I actually would also argue to, in your favor, that 20 a year, that's very hard to do. And I agree, I fully agree with you there. So, and that's actually part of the scenario that I want to review today. So let's move over to the main screen and let's just kind of war game this a little bit to preamble",

So let's move over to the main screen and let's just kind of war game this a little bit to preamble this conversation. And for those that don't know, the conversation today, again, is just a deep dive into my actual trading approach. So if we say 20 a year is difficult, which I fully would agree, wasn't even my target. What I wanted to do is try to find something that can outpace slightly. So maybe we'll do like 15, because that's what I used. And you'll notice that puts you at 1.3 mil. So you still cross the threshold, but this puts us a little deeper than what we might want, meaning 20 years is a hot minute. So that leads us to the other components to the equation that we can modify. And there's really only two. There's our contributions. And then there's a time span. Well, we know we don't want longer. Longer is not the direction we're trying to move this thing. So we know we want shorter. So we know if we shorten this, we're going to have less money. So then where does that put us in this one? You need to save more. The only choice. It's the only choice. Now, you might be able to achieve a higher return than this. I've",

Now, you might be able to achieve a higher return than this. I've been really fortunate over my trading career and I absolutely have. But that being said, trying to think about what's normal and abnormal is important here. Because when we think about the idea of achieving a higher return, a really big part of that is luck. And I'm the first one to admit it. Now, do I think my return is luck overall? Absolutely not. I know that I work super hard for it and I can quantify what I do. However, there is something to be said and to acknowledge about the alignment, just the happenstance of where a trader is at in their trading career. What does the market happen to do during that time frame? And how well is that trader able to capitalize it good or bad? So when I'm talking about luck, I don't mean luck in terms of making money. That's not luck at all. And I know that's not luck. I'm super confident in saying that is skill and I know it's skill because of being able to achieve positive returns when the market's in down and stuff like that. That's skill, confident.

But what I'm talking about is this range here, the difference if we plot this for an example between a 15 return over this time frame and a 28 return. Watch what happens to this number. Sky rocket. It goes parabolic. So do I think that this is realistic? Do I even think that knowing what I know now that I'm going to maintain this going forward? No, I don't think so. I certainly don't think so. The only reason why my compound annual growth rate is that high is because my last two trading years were so unbelievably anomalous as far as the rest of the sample is it skewed everything to the upside. Realistically, my compound annual growth rate tends to be the low 20s. And I fully expect my compound annual growth rate here to trickle back down into that range. So what am I highlighting here? And what does this have to do with my strategies? What I'm highlighting is that the way that you start this game is really important and it's going to inform what you try to do from there because as I just told you, this was not my starting goal.

So in the pursuit of 15 over the last 18 years, I find myself at this number right now, but that's not what I was targeting. So there was a deviation along the path and I'll explain why a little bit later. This part is super important because when we talk about my approach to trading, my approach to trading was built trying to achieve this. How do I get to this number? And the way that I thought about it was like this. If I build you a time series and let's say, I'll do it down here so there's more space. Let's say that this is year 20 and this is year zero. I keep forgetting to update the space on the driver for those things so I can use the bottom of my screen. This is year zero. So the way that this works in my opinion is in the beginning few years, you're gonna have to bounce around. It's gonna take a while to figure out what you're trying to do.

The reason why I'm impatient is not because I want what I want right now. It's because the starting point is uncomfortable enough that it is a significant motivating factor to try to find ways to make that not... To make that not the case. So my entire focus was on building something that was repeatable that I could consistently land around this number. That was my entire idea. It's very different than what a lot of people pursue. The reason why this matter so much is because if I were to pursue top line performance meaning get the best possible return I could, I genuinely would take a different approach.

    "text": "line performance meaning get the best possible return I could, I genuinely would take a different approach. So as I talked to you about my trading approach, it's very important for you to know that context. Because the stuff that we're going to be talking about is stuff that's optimized for robustness. It's not stuff that's optimized to get the best possible return right now. And it's because I viewed it as a genuine no-fail scenario. And you guys all know the context behind that. Not going to waste your time. But that is absolutely why that was my focus. It's because for me it was a no-fail proposition. It wasn't something that I could just risk the money and if I lost it I could just make it back sure. It has cascading impacts that I cared more about. So that consistency is an ultimate driver of what you're about to learn, which is how I generally trade. OK, cool. So let me trash all this. And I want to just go through a broad overview. And I'm not going to spend a ton of time deep diving each individual piece because this is a beginner series. And I want you to focus more on the core concepts that we're going to discuss. And then I'm already working on an offshoot of this to go a little bit deeper. I'll probably do that on the Thursday skill development streams so that we can hone in on individual pieces. But",

But that stuff doesn't matter as much as the main stuff that we're about to review, which is this isor of a slide. So the left hand side you could see how I trade, not really going to spend a ton of time on that upfront. I want to spend more time on the right hand side. And it's specifically number four and number five. So when we think about building a trading approach, you all at this point hopefully are familiar with what I refer to as the outlier strategy process in the outlier trade process. And it's just a framework for thinking. But the strategy process begins with a profit mechanism. It does not begin with a strategy. It does not begin with a structure. It begins with understanding profit mechanisms. And there's a lot of ways we can do that. And I will show you one of them right now together. So I'm going to move this out of the way for just a few moments. And let's take a look at. Palantir, Palantir is fine. It's already up. OK, so if we take a look at Palantir, and I just zoom out, and I'm going to zoom",

There are certain criteria that go into narrowing it down and making it stronger in some instances versus others. But this is something that becomes relatively predictable, not purely predictable, relatively predictable. What I'm trying to explain to you here is the importance of not worrying about if I should use MACD or RSI, not worrying about if I should sell my option at 45 days versus 40 days, not if it should be at a 35 delta versus a 30 delta. All of that stuff is secondary, not saying it doesn't matter, but it's secondary. And I always use the example of a high class problem. If I sell a 30 delta and I say",

Primarily a river about it with the money you just made, right? High class problem, get over it. But what I can tell you is that it doesn't matter if I sell a 30 delta put or a 35 delta put and the underlying goes down, I lose. And then it's a low class problem. It's a function of how much do I lose? The point that I'm making sure is abundantly clear is that your sole focus when building strategies has got to be on profit mechanisms. It's the only thing that matters. After profit mechanisms, then you can get into the neurons. Joe says at the end of the day, it's always about price change. Very close. I actually fully agree with part of that for sure. And that's a really important point. So I'm glad you mentioned that. Joe, it's very, very close. Now for those that are listening, why do I say it's very close instead of saying, I fully agree with that or that's completely correct?

Because if we think about profit mechanisms, they all fall under just a few umbrellas. There's not that many of them. There's stuff that deals with price, direction. There's stuff that deals with volatility. And then you can argue that there's some structural profit mechanisms that very often are subsets of these, not always, but very often. I'm not going to go into things like pricing, discrepancies and stuff like that, but they do exist sometimes. So the reason why Joe is very close, but not fully on target, is because when we think about profit mechanisms, there's two bucket. And for example, if I'm trading vol and I buy a straddle, in the process of buying the straddle, and let's say that I gamma hedge, I guess I'll call it gamma scalp, because we're long, I want to cover that cost. And then I'm going to gamma scalp and delta hedge, which is same same essentially in this context. What I'm doing is I'm actually muting my susceptibility to this.

That's the beautiful part about this. And this is the beautiful part, especially for those that are on the stream right now, is if you ask most traders this kind of question, they will have no idea how to even start tackling this sort of thing. And it's because most people don't think like this. It's not because I'm super unique. It's just because I've looked at this shit long enough that I've found ways to categorize stuff in my mind. That structure adds so much efficiency to what I'm doing. And this is why, again, looking back at what I've been able to return, why I've been able to return those kind of metrics is because while tons and tons of people are looking at and trying to solve the exact wrong questions, not due to being stupid, but due to their own ignorance about the topic and not getting structured enough. So when we're thinking about profit mechanisms, this is effectively how I break it down. There's price direction, there's volatility and then again, there are some other things that would be good for another stream. They're not really relevant right now, but",

    "text": "about the topic and not getting structured enough. So when we're thinking about profit mechanisms, this is effectively how I break it down. There's price direction, there's volatility and then again, there are some other things that would be good for another stream. They're not really relevant right now, but there's maybe three others plus three plus in this bucket down here. So if we then click into these, we can start finding some really good ideas. EHOD says price can't change without volume in a direction. So what categorized each differently? That's not volume, that's volatility. So that's in it's a great question. I'm glad that you asked it because people who are used to trading stock will see vol and they'll see volume. Options traders, when we see vol, we see volatility. So this is volatility. Not volume, good question though. So then if we think within price direction, again, there are different things that I can even see just by eyeballing a chart. This isn't trying to like overfit and look for patterns. This is literally just eyeballing shit. One of those things I literally just showed you for price direction. I just showed you post earnings announcement drift in this case to the upside. That's a price directional trend that we can see. We can quantify it. We can literally measure what the average move is for a basket of stocks that have certain criteria and see what the average move is post earnings. One of",

One of the cool things thinkorswim did is they fixed this. So now we can actually get like pretty specific and granular. Okay, this is what I want. Just adding a couple more data points to the sample. We need to go back a little bit longer once. Do a three year. Do the same thing. Okay. So I want you to look at something. So this is a trade that I took last year. And a bunch of the discord members and people that have been attending the streams, you guys will know about this one because I spent a while talking about it. This is one of the wildest trades that I that I've caught. And I remembered distinctly this was my entry September 11th. So notice how earnings is back here.

It doesn't mean that it can't go up. It just means it doesn't fit the criteria for that specific strategy. So then price goes sideways. This is already on my watch list for a series of reasons that has to do with the volatility price direction, all that kind of stuff. And then we roll sideways and then we come into this day. So this day has massive volume. There was a strong catalyst in terms of news that sent price rising. So leading into this no position, this fits what I call a breakout. Breakout has certain conditions in criteria that I've set for my version of a breakout. And this fit most of them. So I enter a long trade here who is with calls doesn't matter for the sake of the conversation. And then we start fast forwarding time. And I just want you to look at this move from entry points. So not the whole day I didn't get in at the bottom entry point until it starts consolidating sideways. This is a 57 move and this is over",

So not the whole day I didn't get in at the bottom entry point until it starts consolidating sideways. This is a 57 move and this is over a month. So a breakout has very specific criteria and a breakout can turn into other kinds of trades momentum, namely exhibiting some level of drift. And that's mostly what this did, right? The breakout occurred and then it had a couple follow through days. In my world, the breakout stops in this timeframe. And then if it continues, then it starts leaning more into momentum. So now notice this here. And then for those that were on the stream yesterday, there was a stock we looked at. I was T good good reminder gang. Thank you. T it was somebody that one of the members was looking at. What do you notice about T? Well, let's take a look at this earnings move. Let's just call this a breakout and let's measure this breakout until it started consolidating sideways. This is over 30 days and this moved 14.5. Not a bad move. But what do you notice the difference here? This is 10 extra days and 35 less return. What I'm showing you is that the criteria in my approach for a breakout is specific.

When I'm looking at charts, I'm looking at price and volume because we know ultimately that's what moves price. And if we're exploring some sort of price driven strategy, we need to understand price and volume. So what I do is I say, oh, that's kind of interesting. If I look at tea, some shit happened on 25 November of last year. Volume went up massively. Volume was at 64.7 million, where is the five day average was 33. And the 20 day average was also 33. So it effectively doubled. Why? And then what I would do is I would literally go back and I would see what happened. Why did it do that?

So for Reese pick an expiration Joe pick an expiration Ricky, Shreys. All of you guys pick an expiration and while you're picking an expiration give me delta's. All right, so let's grab our workbook. Get rid of all this. She it. Let's learn about some profit mechanism. This is all going to be on 27 jam. I don't remember how many of you came up with something, but it was a few. Stock price right now. 24. I'm just going to default tool one lot for everybody, because that doesn't matter. Okay, so let's see the expiration. TriForce says 60 day at the money calls. All right, so 60 DTE that puts us closest to 60 DTE is 21 March. And at the money will find closest to 50 delta. I'm going to slide this out of the way so I can actually take a peak real fast. That puts us up to 24's. So 24's. And that's 55 delta. Our premium here, I'm going to just take it at the offer. So 0.75. And then this is kind of annoying. All the math is broken. That's the worst equals me one sec. We'll figure it out. So we have our. So we have our one lot here. 75 cents. All right, what else did we get? Lauren says 1 to",

And then we need to divide this by our cost. Again, don't worry about the percent returns here. So this trade boils down to this one. So what do you guys notice? Well, I notice a few things. I noticed the 28, 524 and a half, the 40 delta gave us 231 bucks. I noticed that the 21 March 24 call the 55 delta gave us 235. I noticed that the 14 Feb 25 call 18 delta gave us 75 bucks. So there's a couple really important points here that go back into the idea of figuring out how to build a strategy around a profit mechanism. Is that if we take a look at this scenario and we see how all these trades played out, we can see that there are some that performed very well compared to the others. We can see a middle of the pack and then we can see the bottom of the pack. Great.

And we apply it from the move from here to here. 442. We would probably change some things about the trades we put on. Yes, I assume that will be unanimous. What I'm showing you is that rather than worrying so much, about what's option strategy you want to try to build, if you spend more time analyzing the profit mechanism, you literally start to answer the question for yourself. So in this scenario, we probably know that we would want to put on something that compounds better. We know that not using flat one lot across the entire scenario. We know that there are certain strategies, certain option structures that will perform way better than the others. Because again, if we go back to this scenario, not although these two are created relatively equal in terms of PL, take a look at the return on capital. They're not the same return on capital. So if I were to scale these to not be one lots, but to actually be the same size, this one actually would have two. And this one would smash this one. So the point that I'm making here is that",

And this one would smash this one. So the point that I'm making here is that I normalized all of these based on a one lot, but really what matters in this context is actually this number, the return on invested capital. And we can see that this one did really well. We can see that this one did insanely well. Again, if we were to scale this one to be the same as the others in terms of total size, then this one beats everything. And it's because this was a lower delta. The lower delta did super, super well. And it's because we knew in that scenario, we cherry-picked that the thing would move a lot. But what we're looking at here are a mix of people, in my opinion, that are just defaulting to an approach because it's the default approach. We're not taking the time to think about the scenario and to fit something to that scenario. Now, all that being said, this is a hypothetical. We're looking back in time. But the point is everybody should be able to build an extremely well-performing strategy if we know what happens.

Then the game is trying to figure out what are we able to accurately predict reliably to some degree of consistency and then to build something that generally allows you to capture that. So I'm in no way saying that this is the best choice. It's most certainly not. But what I'm showing you is an important skill of taking the time to one understand profit mechanisms and then two, taking the time to deeply learn options in how they behave. Because if you do those two things in this scenario, you would know that there are even better versions than everything that's here than everything that's here. There are strategies, simple strategies that would make more money than all of these. None of these are optimal. And that's okay. It's not about picking, quote-unquote, optimal. It's about this understanding of how things behave. So the point to take away from that entire segment is that based on our idea, what we build will look super different. It will look very, very different depending on what our idea is. So now to go back to this quickly and then we'll get into some QA because I got a couple of questions ahead of time that are pretty good, I want you to just take a second to take a look at what's",

It's about what the profit mechanism is and then finding something that fits that profit mechanism. Give me one second. So when I look at what my goal was and if you were called, my goal is consistency. Okay, so let's deconstruct this. If I'm trying to make a consistent 15 and I buy an index, it depends on the time frame for this. Because if we take a look and I forgot what you just do it in here. If we take a look over the last 10 years and spy, this is a monthly chart by the way. You'll notice that there are very clear periods where things roll over. That's okay. I don't necessarily mind that. But if I do this for a long enough period of time, well, then this can become pretty powerful if I'm able to get 15 each year.

So that tells me that if I want to do something that's like really basic, it's not going to work, meaning just buy and hold an index. It's not going to work. Because the market unequivocally, we know it has down years. If we take a look at 22 here into 23. This was a quasi bear market, just shy bear market. It didn't end the year in a bear market and ended the year like down like 19. So that gives us important feedback. So if we go back, we now know definitively that the answer to that is no. But if I go back to the same example that I just gave you guys looking at the last 10 years, what do I notice about most of these 10 years? Notice most of them are up. Most of them are positive. Those that understand the way that I build out my portfolio. This should completely logically make sense and hopefully close the loop. Most of the time. So what does that mean?

Now for those that have been following along with the recent coverage strangle example that I've been working with you guys. You will notice that there's a way to amplify this. Liberty Tf's. Coupled with trend following. This is a way to in a leveraged manner benefit from as much of this as we can. But decrease our downside participation. So this is one of the easiest ways to at least conceptually build something that can outperform the market relatively consistently. And again, it's because the market most of the time goes up. And then as long as when things are going down, you're not asleep at the wheel and you have a good approach. Well, now you can easily rotate out, but there's an important difference here. If I'm trading the coverage triangle, the stock's going up and then things start going down. And let's say that I get cut out here. Okay, cool. Let's say at this point on the year, I'm up 8 wherever the year started. Let's see the year started like there's. Well, this is not this. This means that I need other tools in the toolkit.",

Begin with the end in mind. The Marine Corps version of this is just reverse plan. So what I need to do is I need to figure out. I need to break this 15 out.

That's not going to work. So what I do is I build milestones monthly. Quarterly. And what I do is if I'm supposed to make 15 over the course of the year. I know again that if I plot a time series. January to December. I know that it's not going to be linear like this. Not how markets work. But what I need to make sure is the case. Is that if I break this out over quarters. That even if over q one I'm up and then I go back down. And then here like this is still success. Because even though this might be plus 2 over that first quarter. So behind pace. But still in the correct direction. And then next month we try to bump that up and so on. So that's why my account is up so much so far this year. And then the reason why I'm not just leaning in with the core allocation. And then just kind of like waiting and seeing how it shakes out. Doesn't work like that. I use the core allocation over this time frame. The core allocation still fortunately makes money. And it has everything to do with the beautiful component of options. Being able to",

And index ETF is still good. However, in some sort of leverity. F. This is also a slow death. If it does this for too long. So can't just do that forever. That's when you guys saw me rotate into short puts. And I've been in short puts mostly since. And it's simply because the market has been oscillating sideways. This is not a good period to be into a bunch of long levered ETFs. Would it be the worst thing on earth? Something that you can't navigate longer? Which I'm not. It's okay as long as you have a long enough time frame. But it's not what I do. Okay. So I want to summarize with a couple things.

Is to invest the time in understanding profit mechanisms. And then it's to invest the time into deeply understanding options, how they work. And if you do both of those, then you will arrive at many of the same conclusions that I have here. There's nothing novel and what I do whatsoever. There's literally nothing novel and what I do. And it's because it's based on pure market fundamentals. That's literally it. That's literally it. So when I'm trading stuff like breakouts, break downs versus pivots versus flow. There are different ways I set up those trades based on my forward expectations, based on how I know those things behave. And again, I have another slide that I started to build that will go into detail on those with some recent examples for all of them on the Thursday stream. However, the main thing to pay attention to here is that for direction, if I'm trying to trade something that's bearish, it doesn't matter if I sell calls or buy puts.

It doesn't ultimately matter to me because while I was in this trade, it wasn't doing what I thought it was going to do and that's okay that will happen so frequently. Take the trade down at a small loss move on the idea here is still completely valid. But what I care about is how does it behave in this region and for the strategy that I had on and for the idea that I built this trade around this wasn't doing that. Would the short call still be fine. Yeah, of course, got plenty of room. But it didn't align with the idea that I had. So it's really, really important to define the idea so that it becomes super easy to manage a trade because all the questions of like should I do something they go away because it's literally a function of is this thing doing what I thought it should do yes or no no it is time to get out regardless of what the PNL is it doesn't matter.",

Now that being said there were a couple questions that I got from the discord before and then I happy to open it up to anything else but one of them was from the boy Dan who says curious to know more about when you look at fundamentals in which ones and when you don't care so great question so the way to think about fundamental and technical analysis is this. If we go to strategy process it matters here. This is when I start looking at fundamentals so effectively when I'm looking at profit mechanisms I'm just looking at something that moves in some way that I think it can monetize then I need to understand it deeply and that's where I do all the research and understanding going back to post earnings announcement trip that's fundamentals. And understanding what criteria is important for something to on average exhibit post earnings announcement drift is literally quantifiable you can do the research you can find out just like I did it's not that difficult all I do is take a look at a few thousand",

And understanding what criteria is important for something to on average exhibit post earnings announcement drift is literally quantifiable you can do the research you can find out just like I did it's not that difficult all I do is take a look at a few thousand stocks over the last 10 years. And I analyze the conditions around their earnings releases and what the follow on price performance not only over the next quarter I actually do like the next day three days five days 10 days 20 days 60 days that kind of thing. Measure and see what it looks like so the way that I use fundamentals is twofold the first way that I use fundamentals is general understanding of things context so there are a lot of instances where I will have fundamental knowledge but it's not necessarily a big part of the trade decision. It's just something that I'm generally keeping an eye out for that's one scenario. Then the next scenario is if I'm trading something that fundamentals matter for my idea here's the way to think about that and then we'll get into what fundamentals because it does matter and it actually changes based on time frame fun fact. So if I was trading let's say let's say that I wanted to trade S a T S but let's say I wanted to trade their earnings release itself I was going to trade volatility for their earnings release. Do I",

Let's take a look at another scenario you guys know that I have a position on and Palin's here this is a much longer term idea the position I have on and Palin's here is like all the way out into 2027 so clearly a completely different expectation here. So fundamentals do matter and fun fact you can deconstruct what fundamentals matter over what time frames and there's a really easy way to think about this so if we take a look at. Palin's here and we take a look at their financials. There's a couple things that matter to me pretty much more than anything really on things like the multiple actually do matter but not that much. Things that matter a lot if you think about again you can always do yourself a favor if you go back to the basics what is it what does a company do. They sell something.

How is that working how is that going so the very first series of metrics that matter the absolute most to me are sales that's what the company is meant to do sell it's got to sell something. So that's the first thing I care most about. Then after that it starts getting more nuanced based on the holding duration and what I think matters the most but revenue how much is it able to keep I care about things like operating efficiency metrics how well does it manage the money that they have I care about things like debt. How much debt do they maintain debt matters a lot because it can absolutely tear a company down if they misuse debt it's not good. So what I can do is get a sense and literally take a closer look at how things are going in terms of our sales going how much of that are we able to keep.

So fundamentals matter it's ultimately what moves the company even things that I'm trading loosely I'll generally have an idea but there's an equal number of instances where I have no idea there's I use this example yesterday since it's completely true there are times where I'll trade things that I literally don't even know what the company does I have absolutely no idea because some of the things I'm trading it doesn't matter. If I'm trading volatility in something I don't really care I just care about what vol is priced at what I think might be an opportunity for where vol might be better placed at not saying that it's too expensive or too cheap because who am I to say that and then that can become an idea.

And then another one is from Elizabeth which is how you practically incorporate Greeks into the strategies this is one of like the greatest possible questions and you guys actually got an example of it here. The way that I incorporate the Greeks is by once I understand how the profit mechanism works and I'm thinking about how I want to capture the profit mechanism the Greeks or what tell me what makes the most sense like I said in the scenario here none of these are optimal. I know that because I know the Greeks. So the way that I use the Greeks in any strategy is using it as an input against what my expectation is and then what actual position best reflects that.

So then if I go further out in time to the 15 Jan 27's if I pick some sort of strike that's super far out of the money I can do that one of the problems there though is I know gamma is pretty much nonexistent this far out.

Because if I go super far out in time I know what theta does there's going to be more theta but there's going to be a lower theta decay as a percentage of the total premium there can be more gross theta decay if you go super far out in time because what ends up happening is if you're super close in time. You literally start running out of extrinsic value in the options so if I take a look at this five delta. Theta decay on the five delta here is eight cents then it goes to six cents at the three delta if we go back out here. And we take a look at our theta our theta is like four cents across the board so you can see that there actually are instances where the seven day options will have less gross theta coming out of them but it's because theta as a percentage of premium there is massively different does that make sense to everybody if not please tell me and then I'll literally show you but if it does make sense to everybody that's cool.

I'm happy to keep plugging along the reason why this is an important point is this goes directly to the heart and soul of the question of when do we use the Greeks and how well we use the Greeks and literally all of them because there's no reason not to and we use all of them to better understand what options and what combination of options makes the most sense for the idea that we have. Another great example of this is when i'm trading earnings. If i'm trading earnings i know that the expiration that contains earnings is most important to me. So the reason why i know that is because of the way options behave it's by understanding that those near term options are going to have the largest impact to their volatility now this one confuses people a lot because people confuse Vega with term impacts which is worth talking about for just a second. So if we take a look at 15 Jan 27 and Palantir just because we're here. And we look at Vega for the at the money's the Vega is 62 cents okay that's pretty high. Let's go to this is on for aug. So let's go to",

Which one of these is going to experience a larger change in volatility. So the following earnings. Is it this expiration that has a lower Vega or is it the longer term expiration that has a higher Vega. The longer term expiration has a higher Vega so that would tell us that. It seems like that would move more based on vault. That's not the case. And it's because of the volatility surface. It's because black sholes, Merton model makes simplifying assumptions one of which is flat vault. Well, we know that there's a volatility surface. So if I plot the volatility surface for you. I can see that funny enough if I plot 20 June against 18 July what do you notice. The 20 June the purple line is actually higher. If I do 18 July against 15 aug. Let me do the next primary to set.

This is the normal relationship where near term options actually often will have higher vault. So even though further out in time options can have more Vega. They very frequently will experience less of a total volatility impact because volatility doesn't hit the end of the expiration cycle is heavy as the front as the exp of the expiration cycle. This is also why when you're trading stuff like volatility you have to be really, really careful because somebody might say, OK, I'm going to go into VIX. And let's say when the VIX was down here in the 15 handle or even down here even better. It's in the 13 handle. We know at some point VIX is going to go up. We know at some point it will go up.

The problem is if vault is higher, let's say here, right? So let's say we got in in the beginning of December, couple days go by couple weeks, I should say. And then mid December, we get this peak involved. That's great. We're sitting there saying like, Oh, shit, our position should be crushing it right now. Well, what's the problem? VIX is 30 day, vault. So yes, 30 day, vault has absolutely gone up. But your options that are out 221 days aren't tied to 30 day, vault. They're tied to a wall that's 221 days out. So even though 30 day, vault moved, your options might not actually move that much. And it's for the same exact reason. Okay. So we have a few minutes left. We have a couple questions in the chat.

And unequivocally, what matters much less is what the individual structure used or the individual strategy used. Those are minute details again that do matter a lot, but they only matter a lot once the first pieces are in place. The first pieces being things like understanding profit mechanisms. If you understand profit mechanisms more deeply. And then options more deeply the rest of this realistically becomes pretty damn simple. But that's where most of the work is done. Just says I had a strangle on and crude that got stopped out at two times max loss. Should I put on a new one or is undefined risk a bad idea? That's up to you. You're still defining the list, the risk at two times max loss. So I wouldn't say that it's inherently a bad idea, but what would be a bad idea is to put the trade on unless you have some sort of directional. Right.

So for me, I would be more prone to trade something like this directionally, but that's my approach. Right. Your idea might be this thing is in the 70 low 70 handle. And you think it's going to exist in the low 70 handle for whatever duration you choose to run your strangle for. So in that scenario, the strangle can make completely fine sense. It's all based on your idea, I would say. Reese says in the example of tea, you said none of those were optimal. Was there one that. Is there one that was or just that the best one captures the profit mechanism? Yeah, it's the it's the ladder of those.

Because if you go too far out of the money, then your options can actually expire out of the money. Well, that's not good. So there is a too far.

This the day that we're using here. Is 27 Jan. Picker is tea. Not ticker. And then I'm going to squish this thing down so that we can. Stock price 24. Now what I'm going to do is size these comparatively, but I'll do it after the fact. So we'll start with our single lot. And then we know again, this is cherry picking. So we know. The third of March is where it peaks. So we're going to trade around third of March. So here's the first thing. I can tell you that 14 all of these feb are suboptimal. The reason why all the febs are suboptimals because you're not maximizing the move. We know again, historic is looking at. Third March. So something that's close to three March is where you're going to get the most for your move. So that puts us in seven March. Okay. So now we know that it's going to land around 27. So then let's literally look at a few different deltas. I'm going to show you 75 delta. A 50 delta. A 25 delta. And then what's the 27 handle at. A 20 delta. And then I'll show you a further out as well. Let's do like a 15 delta or 10 delta, which it doesn't",

I was wondering why this is so weird. So we'll do 25 delta. We'll do the 20 delta. And then we'll do this one. What is this at probabilities at 16 there's no way. This is just because of the expiration and stuff. Let's see if this one has better delta's for us to go off of. Yeah. Okay. So the 30 delta is like point zero and change. So we'll call the 30 delta here. Sorry, the 30 strike. We'll just call this like 0.02. So super, super low. So this will be 30. The 20 delta is way up here. Actually, so this will be 25.5. The 25.5 is a 13 delta. 0.13. Then the next closest we have is the 25 strike, which is a 29 delta. Close as we have to 50 delta is here. So this is a 24. This is a 57 delta.

So the next thing we need to do. Wait, where's my fucking. What the fuck just happened? This is not right. What did I do? I don't know what that is. OK, it just copied in weird. So now let's go to three March. And I'm just going to pause it. At wherever we're at, we'll take a look at the expiration. We'll see where everything sits. Reese says gamma, gamma factor into your strike selection. Not in this example. This is more just a. Showing you, but the gamma is obviously going to be wrapped into the delta. Right.

And then we just have to round down. So this one you get a two lot. Five lot nine lot. 46 lot. So if we take a look. At the PNL. For all of these, you'll notice a super clear trend. The super super clear trend. The trend that you see. Is that the lower delta you get. That. Puts you in the money. At expiration. If you're sizing everything the same is optimal.

So it's still doing it correctly. I have it do him like the absolute value. Yeah. So this one would have lost money though. So anyways, the broader point is that breakdown. In the delta selection. For this very cherry picked idea. And again, the way that you get to this is by having a deep understanding of options. If you understand options deeply like this is as clear as day. What works best here. Not like a hypothetical at all. And the beautiful part about that is that level of understanding of options is literally. Accessible to everybody.

And then for those that are in the outlier pro plus program. We have our coaching folks. We have our first workshop slated for 29 June at 1500 Pacific time. So that will be a live zoom call with me. And whoever else is able to make it. And then we'll work through like a bunch of case studies. I have in mind. Some goal setting and stuff like that. So looking forward to an awesome session with you guys for that. In the meantime, if you guys need anything, as always, let your boy know. Be an outlier. See you guys later.",
