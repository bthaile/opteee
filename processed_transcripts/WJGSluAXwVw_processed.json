When you say false alarms, is that people doing like the date calling thing? I've never fully understood that yet. But is that what you mean by false alarms? Roaring Titi says a lot of people got really wrecked when Robin Hood took away the buy button. I don't understand that to be honest. I don't understand how Robin Hood taking the buy button away and other brokerages taking the buy button away like wrecked people. Because you can still sell, you can still get out. So I understand that that means that the stock didn't keep going up parabolically. But that goes back to the thing that I've talked with Newton about and I've also talked with Peruvian Bull about where the like, again, like this is why I don't fully understand the angle sometimes because Roaring Titi says a lot of brokers went down retail couldn't do anything for a time. Is that is that accurate? Like they couldn't sell either because that actually would be very surprising to me. Now if it was frozen, limit up, limit down, then yeah, you'd have to catch it outside of the lock periods. But from what I saw, there was still order flow happening. Yeah, Jimmy says it made people lose",

The reason why it surprises me so much is because I don't understand how anybody in their rational mind would expect any stock, not GameStop, but any stock to go up into essentially to a point where it could collapse the financial system. I'm not saying that the conditions being set leading to that as a possible outcome or rational, they're not. That's from a bunch of bullshit. Completely agree. Notive. But I think it's interesting to me when something that clearly hasn't had a big change in fundamental value goes up over, to over 400 bucks for multiple days and then to just kind of sit there and hold it, right? Because if I'm not mistaken, it hung up in like the multiple hundreds for a few days. Let me make sure I'm not way off base. Does trading view do like pre-adjusted split basis or whatever? It doesn't look like it. It looks like it does split adjusted. Yeah, because it was over 400 back here. Lauren says the fact that a stock going up could wreck the financial system is",

The fact that that's a thing and the fact that that was the case here is insane. And this is literally one of the shining examples of broad manipulation, 100 broad manipulation. And the fact that this was at such a severe range is crazy to me that it was even allowed to be like, how can something be multiple hundreds per cent short? There's only so many fucking shares. So like that stuff is so frustrating. And again, I completely agree with like those components. But again, it's so important to decouple frustrations, preferences, what we wish reality was from what reality is. And the fact that this shouldn't have been multiple 100 shorted and even in a position to be able to go up to 400 plus, that can only happen from a systemic manipulation that's being caught in unwound.

Like I get that this movement didn't materialize as far as it theoretically could have. We know that for sure. But we also know again, pretty reasonably that we're not going to allow the financial system to collapse because of this issue. Again, we have to like, we have to partition these things because in my opinion, if there's the intervention to prevent the collapse, then those who are systemically on the wrong side of this trade, they should go out of fucking business and they should have to pay. Like I literally think they should go bankrupt. But that's a, that's a, again, that's like another part of the broader partitioning mentality that I go through. But like if this goes into a total financial collapse, then nobody makes money anyways. The stock market collapsed. So it's like, I just don't understand the broader expectation there.

I don't believe that it will be permitted to run in a game of squeeze four figures plus. I think that if it somehow changes as a fundamental business and we're talking like 35 years down the road, sure, I think it could do that. I think it could do that if it really starts to grow as an effective efficient business. But I don't think that again, I don't think the market is going to permit a squeeze to that degree.

Again, they just asked my opinion if I think it's going to. The reason why I don't think it's going to is because there's so much new float that's been injected into the system. And the market cap is now growing with how much cash they have. It starts to become more difficult for that kind of manipulation to occur and then to be squeezed out like that. I think one of the big things the ape community had going for a long time was having a pretty significant amount of the float locked. But with the recent offerings, it's going to take a hot minute for retail to slowly attempt to scoop up the new float and DRS hit and lock that. And it's a, it's a pretty long process. So I have like genuinely it is completely possible. I just don't think it's likely to answer their question more specifically. So yeah. Long Swazie says at this point, I'm wondering how many shares treated each day or just created liquidity no matter which stock, which is a fair question. That's a really fair question.

It's, and that's one of the ways that the government weasels its way out of being pinned down by litigation is because since the government essentially has unlimited budget to fight these kinds of things. It's not technically true, but it's kind of practically true. So it lets them, it let's like, it lets them draw things out. Because for people that are hiring counsel to pursue something, that all costs money and it costs money over time. So yeah, one of the tactics that you'll find from government entities is to specifically move very slow. And again, like it or like it or not, it's fucking smart.

So, Jen, how close we were to this system breaking something failing? How close were we, Thomas? We were frighteningly close on January 28th when we had 50 million registered shares at the same time. We had 70 million shares short and 150 million shares short via short coal options. So, you'd love some short calls, eh? Yeah, no. And like you said, frighteningly close. So yeah, we were, we were on the cusp. Absolutely on the cusp. Um, all right, cool. So, let's take a look at, well, first, do we have any updates to our eight map? We have less people here now. So, I'm, I'm concerned that the likelihood of us filling out via Madagascar or Reunion or Moritas. That one's also viable. What's this one? I don't know, but I think it's one.

And it looks like perceived nominal value at this point is like mid 20s. And that's just because this is kind of like a new floor that it's been moving around within for some time now. So, it's very likely the where this thing is starting to be accepted as a price level. Now, I find a couple things interesting. One of which is if you take a look at the move of volatility, it is collapsing. So, if I move this out to a year, you can see obviously where we had that bit of a spike back in May, absolutely skyrocketed. Short-term vol and it started sending 30-day vol very high. And then essentially from those points, they've been steadily contracting with a couple bumps along the way, but still very much a declining line here. And volatility is just being pulled more and more out of here. So, that's one of the biggest things that I see going on with GameStop is the volatility has been contracting massively.

So, if you look at the 90-day average day range, 5.29 now it's at 2.88, almost half. So, across the board, it just tells us things are quieting down. Again, I don't think that's any shock to anybody, but I think it's at least worth while as a general data point. So, taking a look at the options chain itself, it has also gotten very quiet. So, there's still a two-to-one relationship between puts and calls, but overall volume is very, very light. And most of the OI at this point is actually out in 17 Jan 25. So, we're not seeing a bunch of these really near-term style options being thrown around anymore, whereas before the front expirations used to be really, really, really heavy. And that's just not what we're seeing now. Because you can even see after the 17 Jan expiration cycle, the next largest on the call side at least is 15 NOV.

What I meant by that is like mid-20s, like mid-20s, not mid-20 handle, but mid-20, 50 cents, 20, or 60 cents. That's what I meant there. But back to the options, volatility is super low. So, volatility is collapsed pretty massively. It's not even, we don't even have anything over 100 now. The next largest is an 8 NOV at 92 Vol. And IV percentile, this uses IV rank, but IV percentile is 13. IV rank is 5 and 3 quarters. So, Vol, Vol across the board just siphoned out, very, very low. Let's take a quick look and see if there is anything that came through from an interesting order flow perspective. I didn't see much that caught my eye, but we'll take a peek. DJT on the other hand has been crazy. And let's look at last seven days. So, I mean, there's a little bit going on, but not a ton.

And a lot of these are still a little bit on the smaller side, as per what we've seen when things start getting really, really active. So, that's what I'm seeing at a high level. As always, if there's anything in particular that you guys want to take a peek at, let me know. But otherwise, we can pivot over to the cats, the cats last series of trades and see if we can't pick up anything from there. Anything that you guys came across? Was there any interesting like DD that's popped up or anything like that? Sava. I'm not going to look at Sava yet. Maybe we'll take a look towards the end, but I like keeping this more GameStop focused. So, I'm going to stick on this. Yolo Tweet. Oh, yeah, let's see. Mm-mm. Looking for... Why is Cohen's accounts over defined? Wait, Yolo Tweet, by who? Okay, he got rid of it. I saw this. That was hilarious. He just seems to like to bother people. Because he knows that this will piss some people off. What are the comments to this? There it is. What the fuck? Let's see what the letterwork looks like. It looks good so far. This looks like a solid tattoo. That's a good artist. The problem with red though is the red won't last. That's the downside. The red starts to fade in. I have a little",

This one has some white on it. That is like essentially completely gone. Wow, okay. Dude, the comments in this are fucking crazy. Okay. Okay. I think we're good. That's entertaining enough. All right, so let's see where we had left off here. All right. So we had saw those series of trades leading into this that looked like he was kind of like testing positions. Then I don't remember. It's been a while now. What we thought the exit. Ruin Titty says it's funny. His tweet was about Trump, but all everyone saw our tips. Oh, you know, see like that. That's the kind of thing that you know. Like what I mean is you know, you know Ryan Cohen specifically did that. You know that. And again, the reason why I know that is because he makes it obvious enough that you can pick it up, right? It's not like this insanely deep message that takes people years to figure out. It's pretty superficial, pretty easy to pick up. So like if you look at the stuff that he tweets, he's just a troll. He",

I enjoy it. I'm a big fan. So for his for the cats, trades here. Wait, where did we? Is this all the way caught up? 13 June. Okay. So we got through all of it. And for the exit here, I think that there was a lot of debate whether or not he exercised or not. I don't remember what the ending solution was. So, Vampirita says we're caught up. Seven know hype date from Newton. I mean, I definitely hope that works. I don't really do the whole, I don't do the whole hype date thing. But maybe. Yes, so let's see what happened in here. So, 567 54 20. So basis would be what 25. 2567. Vampirita says you put in the data, but then analyze the June ones. There we go. Thank you. Okay. Yeah, let's do that.

All right, let's figure that out. Let's get to the bond with that. So sometime between 16 April and 2 June 24, that's not super useful. But prior to 2 June, and I think we'll see them pretty easily. Because if I'm not mistaken, it's somewhere around May, where most of these happen. So let's go to. All of May. I'm going to get rid of the puts. Yeah. So these look like. These look like him.

I'm literally just going to count all of the 5,000 order blocks. And so we need size to be minimum 5,000. And I mean, we could just do some counting one. These don't count.

I mean, there's a couple that look slightly different to me, but it doesn't actually matter quite that much. I'm getting hit up by my door dash. They said that we got like a half hour. So we got plenty of time. So the 21st, two trades, four trades. This was 12, two, one, one, one. This clearly follows his pattern. Again, this is the process of fingerprinting. You can pretty clearly start to figure out people's tendencies and behaviors. And one of them that I can clearly see is he starts early with a couple small stuff. Like this is the other version that we looked at a while ago. This one is that middle version that we kind of tested. We were sort of curious about what we think might be him, but not sure. So this is just confirming that that what we just did here. That's what this is up here.

How many are in this one? So we have that two, three, two, so 21 May is where we left it out of this version. But I think this one was close to closer to netting out. So we know what the residual basis was here for the position. We did all that stuff. So let's take a look. I want to specifically funnel on the unwind between 10 and 13 June. So the first thing we can easily do is just go between 10 and 14 June. But I don't see size here that would indicate. Yeah, no, I don't see size here that would indicate him exiting by selling. My hunch. Vladimir says, but depending on volume couldn't limit orders be broken into smaller blocks that happens to me. Yeah, they can be. But you can still aggregate them together. So a lot of times, depending on what we're looking at, you'll actually see that with those little stacked bigger that'll be in between these. It's like a little stacked icon that's pulling together multiple trades that then that are aggregated up, but they were individual positions. Because",

Would be that he would have sold. I don't see them here. But that's still my, my guess is that he would have sold. And the reason for that is because he still had enough time on these options. Well, I mean, he definitely sold some of them. We know he did. And the reason why we know he did is because he didn't take on the full share allocation. So not so sure why that like that should be in here. I actually don't know why it's not here at all, but it should be. Let's do minimum size like a thousand. Yeah, I mean, that's nowhere near enough. And this still is nowhere near enough. I have no explanation for that. Other than I just don't trust the data that's here is the explanation I have. The reason for that is, Roryntady says I don't think he sold. But I mean, like we've we absolutely know he sold at least some of it.

I'm going to show you on the calculator just so that you can see exactly. Well, I thought the calculator would rotate. Calculators break them a balls right now. So for a million shares. It's. Yeah. So 120,000 options here. Again, you have to move the decimal place over twice. So he would be adding another 12 million shares. And he doesn't do that, right? Like I can clearly see he doesn't do that because if we go to this, he's only adding what for four million, 1000 or whatever it was, four million. 2000. Oh, no, this was the stocks put from before. So the tricky part about this is I know for a fact. Again, based on this, I can conclusively conclude that between 11, 12 and 13 June that there should be at the very least most of this being sold.

So the basis would have been 567 54. So the option was 567 54. And they were the 20s. So the basis, if he exercised would be this plus this. 25674 is what is effective basis would be. So. This doesn't exactly line up not massively far apart. So it would be really difficult. Magdom says maybe he sold and exercise market maker internalized trade again, why sitting around his cost basis. So he's not going to be able to sell because he wouldn't have the market maker out of. Like the market maker, they can't change this right they can they can internalize the order so it doesn't hit the tape but the value of it is still going to be at market value at that time. Like the market maker. If he like if he exercised, this is what the cost of the exercise. This is what the basis would have been at the Delta basis, which isn't here. Off Putin says remember that on 12 June, GME shares declined 16.5 on the day he got out. I think",

Did you mean the 11th off Putin? No, off put I'm not saying exercising. I'm not talking about whether well it can be reflected in volume depending on where the shares are sourced from. But that's not yeah, that's not what I'm referring to anyways. Now, Royntady says what was his cost basis? Yeah, so his actual cost basis on based on the variance between these two, the 10 June update and the 13 June update. His basis would have been 2609 on what he added. Now again, this is on average. There is a world and again, like this can be the case. There is a world where he could have exercised a very small amount of his options and then bought the rest on the market to create an average basis. Of 2609. Off Putin says June 12 was Tuesday, not Saturday. What? Am I in the wrong month? Oh, wait. The impurities says bingo. I don't think it's bingo because there's",

I'm so suspective data now after doing a lot of this stuff. Okay, so you said 12 June here, which is Wednesday. You still fucking lied to me, but we're still closer. 12 June is Wednesday. Rantit, he says that says 2568 closing price of GM me on 12 June is 2546. No, so this, this shows if he exercised. So if he exercised, this is what his basis, that's what this number here should be if he exercised. This represents the variance between the added cost and the added shares, not the variance. It represents the variance between these two posts. What was on 10 June? What was on 13 June? The delta between these. So the change in his cost basis from 21274 to 234135. And by adding 4,000,000,000 shares, this is what his basis would be. So on Swazie says does that include fees fees don't come part of the basis. So",

So on Swazie says does that include fees fees don't come part of the basis. So fees are assessed as a separate line item. That's why on brokerage platforms. It'll actually show you like total commissions and fees is a line item. So this is all encompassing whatever the platform tracks. So Magnum says didn't he have 20 options that he got dirt cheap premium and could exercise. It's not so much about the premium being cheap. He still would have left a massive amount of time value left in the options. So we can take a look at an example of this together. Let's go to 11 June. Here. 24. June. Which will 11. Actually, you don't even have to go to 11. Let's go to 13th when we know he got out. This will be the. I mean, I think it's better. Rowing to the says wasn't there only a week left.

So let's take a look. And I'll show you why I don't think he did exercise. Newton and I we had a long debate about this because Newton also thinks that he exercised. But I think that's just because Newton doesn't fully understand options. And he was the I think the thing Newton was doing there was pattern seeking. Right. It was confirmation bias. He wanted them to exercise because of Newton's perception of what that would mean in terms of creating like another wave potentially. But I don't think mathematically it lines up again, just from calculating the residual basis. We already see his basis would have to be on average 26 or nine. But more importantly, let's take a look at his options. Which were the 21 June's. And he had the 20s. So let's actually do the math here and let's not do the lazy back of the napkin way of doing this. So right now game stop is trading at 28. 5 6 9 9. His 20 calls. He has 20 calls.

Oh, because the vault so fucked up, I don't even know what they would have classified it as. Interesting. So it was like 23 cents something like that. So then if we have 23 cents on again, it wouldn't be the full. Because again, we know that he didn't exercise all 120,000, right? That's again, it's just an objective fact because he only added. 4 million 1000 shares. So for him to get to that. He could have done 40,000 and 10. This is what if we take the exercise scenario, this is what he would have exercised. And the issue with this is this is his extrinsic value here. I'll create some labels. And intrinsic equals this minus this. So this is his intrinsic value. So this is going back to basic options. And I can zoom this in a little bit to make it easier to see. So he could have exercised up to 40,000 and 10. If he did that. This is this is what would have happened. He would have taken this 40,000 in 10 contracts. And then",

He would have taken this 40,000 in 10 contracts. And then he would essentially give up a million dollars. Because this is the extrinsic value that he would have given up. And he otherwise could collect by selling the option and then going to the open market. So from two data points. I don't believe he exercised the first one is because the basis here doesn't match up. Again, if he exercised using this 40,000 and 10. His additional basis would have had to have been 20609 and it wasn't. So that's the first part. The second part is that he would have given up 920,000 dollars. And I just I know that he's not in it for the money is not super concerned. But I also don't think he's in the business of just throwing money away, which is literally what that is. It's just throwing it away. So I think that he wanted to monetize the calls before expiration. This is one of the few instances where he actually exited relatively early. Most of the other periods he exited when the option still had like no time left. So this is why I don't think he exercised his options. And this is why I think that the math leads",

Did you imagine being a billionaire off of GameStop stock? Like what a story that is incredible. Absolutely incredible. So I mean, that looks pretty clear to me in terms of. Did he exercise or did he not? And this to me overwhelmingly looks like he did not. So interesting though, very, very interesting.
