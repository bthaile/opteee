When you say false alarms, is that people doing like the date calling thing? I've never fully understood that yet. But is that what you mean by false alarms? Roaring Titi says a lot of people got really wrecked when Robin Hood took away the buy button. I don't understand that to be honest. I don't understand how Robin Hood taking the buy button away and other brokerages taking the buy button away like wrecked people. Because you can still sell, you can still get out. So I understand that that means that the stock didn't keep going up parabolically. But that goes back to the thing that I've talked with Newton about and I've also talked with Peruvian Bull about where the like, again, like this is why I don't fully understand the angle sometimes because Roaring Titi says a lot of brokers went down retail couldn't do anything for a time. Is that is that accurate? Like they couldn't sell either because that actually would be very surprising to me.

The reason why it surprises me so much is because I don't understand how anybody in their rational mind would expect any stock, not GameStop, but any stock to go up into essentially to a point where it could collapse the financial system. I'm not saying that the conditions being set leading to that as a possible outcome or rational, they're not. That's from a bunch of bullshit. Completely agree. Notive. But I think it's interesting to me when something that clearly hasn't had a big change in fundamental value goes up over, to over 400 bucks for multiple days and then to just kind of sit there and hold it, right? Because if I'm not mistaken, it hung up in like the multiple hundreds for a few days. Let me make sure I'm not way off base. Does trading view do like pre-adjusted split basis or whatever?

The fact that that's a thing and the fact that that was the case here is insane. And this is literally one of the shining examples of broad manipulation, 100 broad manipulation. And the fact that this was at such a severe range is crazy to me that it was even allowed to be like, how can something be multiple hundreds per cent short? There's only so many fucking shares. So like that stuff is so frustrating. And again, I completely agree with like those components. But again, it's so important to decouple frustrations, preferences, what we wish reality was from what reality is. And the fact that this shouldn't have been multiple 100 shorted and even in a position to be able to go up to 400 plus, that can only happen from a systemic manipulation that's being caught in unwound.

And the market cap is now growing with how much cash they have. It starts to become more difficult for that kind of manipulation to occur and then to be squeezed out like that. I think one of the big things the ape community had going for a long time was having a pretty significant amount of the float locked.

So I have like genuinely it is completely possible. I just don't think it's likely to answer their question more specifically. So yeah.

So I don't think that there's really going to be any big updates for a little bit. The litigation process is going to take a long time. It's, and that's one of the ways that the government weasels its way out of being pinned down by litigation is because since the government essentially has unlimited budget to fight these kinds of things. It's not technically true, but it's kind of practically true. So it lets them, it let's like, it lets them draw things out. Because for people that are hiring counsel to pursue something, that all costs money and it costs money over time. So yeah, one of the tactics that you'll find from government entities is to specifically move very slow. And again, like it or like it or not, it's fucking smart. It's really smart because they're essentially just waiting people out. So, cactus jacks is, did you ever see the interview with ib Petr Fee? I'd like to point out that we have come dangerously close to the collapse of the entire system? Yeah, definitely.

We had 70 million shares short and 150 million shares short via short coal options. So, you'd love some short calls, eh? Yeah, no. And like you said, frighteningly close. So yeah, we were, we were on the cusp. Absolutely on the cusp. Um, all right, cool. So, let's take a look at, well, first, do we have any updates to our eight map? We have less people here now. So, I'm, I'm concerned that the likelihood of us filling out via Madagascar or Reunion or Moritas. That one's also viable. What's this one? The third one.

And it looks like perceived nominal value at this point is like mid 20s. And that's just because this is kind of like a new floor that it's been moving around within for some time now. So, it's very likely the where this thing is starting to be accepted as a price level. Now, I find a couple things interesting. One of which is if you take a look at the move of volatility, it is collapsing. So if I move this out to a year, you can see obviously where we had that bit of a spike back in May, absolutely skyrocketed. Short-term vol and it started sending 30-day vol very high. And then essentially from those points, they've been steadily contracting with a couple bumps along the way, but still very much a declining line here. And volatility is just being pulled more and more out of here. So that's one of the biggest things that I see going on with GameStop is the volatility has been contracting massively.

If we take a look at the movements in the both average true range, average day range, both of those are coming down massively. So if you look at the 90-day average day range, 5.29 now it's at 2.88, almost half. So across the board, it just tells us things are quieting down. Again, I don't think that's any shock to anybody, but I think it's at least worth while as a general data point. So taking a look at the options chain itself, it has also gotten very quiet. So there's still a two-to-one relationship between puts and calls, but overall volume is very, very light. And most of the OI at this point is actually out in 17 Jan 25. So we're not seeing a bunch of these really near-term style options being thrown around anymore, whereas before the front expiration is used to be really, really, really heavy. And that's just not what we're seeing now, because you can even see after the 17 Jan expiration cycle, the next largest on the call side at least is 15 NOV. So we're not seeing the same centralization in the one NOV expiration cycle the eight NOV so far. So yeah. Vladimir says, GME didn't close 22 or even once mid-20s are a far",

Yes, sorry, what I meant by that is mid-20s, like mid-20s, not mid-20 handle, but mid-20, 50, 20, 60, that's what I meant there. So, but back to the options, volatility is super low. So volatility is collapsed pretty massively. It's not even, we don't even have anything over 100 now, the next largest is an 8 NOV at 92 vol.

That's what this is up here. But he's done this multiple times where we see him scaling in small and then building building into the position. And then this one we missed. I don't know which one we left off of here. How many are in this one? So we have that. Two, three. Two. So 21 may. Is where. We left it out of this version.

I have no explanation for that. Other than I just don't trust the data that's here is the explanation I have. The reason for that is. Rowing to the says I don't think he sold. But I mean, like we've we absolutely know he sold at least some of it. Right. So the way that we know the way that we know with certainty that he sold some of it is because if you do the math. That's 120,000 calls. Times a hundred, which would be. One point what I'm going to show you on the calculator just so that you can see exit. Well, I thought the calculator would rotate.

Because if we go to this, he's only adding what? 4,000,000 or whatever it was 4,000,000. Oh, no, this was the stocks split from before. So the tricky part about this is I know for a fact. Again, based on this, I can conclusively conclude. That between 11, 12 and 13 June. That there should be. At the very least. Most of this being sold. Because he, if we take the hypothetical that he did exercise. If we take that hypothetical, I can tell you he didn't exercise all of it. And because he doesn't even have enough cash in the account to take all of it. The other component here is he had access to 12 million. And he took on 4,000,000,000. So we've done this before, but we can take a look at what the basis of that is. So then we have what is this 10 June? 10 June, 24. And then we have 13 June. And then we have 5 million at 21, 274. 21, 27, 4. And then we have 9.1 or 9.001 at 23 4135. 23 4135. 23 4135. And then now this is 9.001. Literally thing I just copy the math. Thank you.

So I don't understand. Yeah, I just don't understand. So this. Yeah, I like why would there there's it would be so difficult to unwind that whole position in like 200 lot, 100 lot.

What do we have? It was 565. His basis would have been 56754. So the option was 56754. And they were the 20s.

No, because he wouldn't have the market maker out of like the market maker, they can't change this. They can internalize the order so it doesn't hit the tape, but the value of it is still going to be at market value at that time. So the market maker, if he exercised, this is what the cost of the exercise, this is what the basis would have been at, the delta basis, which isn't here.

So the change in his cost basis from 21274 to 234135 and by adding 4,000,000,000 shares, this is what his basis would be. Lon Swaisy says does that include fees? Fies don't come part of the basis. So fees are assessed as a separate line item. That's why on brokerage platforms, it'll actually show you like total commissions and fees as a line item. So this is all encompassing whatever the platform tracks. So Magnum says, didn't he have 20 options that he got dirt cheap premium and could exercise. It's not so much about the premium being cheap. He still would have left a massive amount of time value left in the options. So we can take a look at an example of this together. Let's go to 11 June. Here. 24. June, which will 11.

I don't even know what they would have classified it as. Interesting. So it's like 23 cents something like that. So then. If we have 23 cents on again, it wouldn't be the full.

So for him to get to that. He could have done 40,000 and 10. This is what if we take the exercise scenario, this is what he would have exercised. And the issue with this is this is his extrinsic value here. I'll create some labels. Intrinsic equals. This minus this. So this is his intrinsic value. So this is going back to basic options. And I can zoom this in a little bit to make it easier to see. So he could have exercised up to 40,000 and 10. If he did that. This is this is what would have happened. He would have taken this 40,000 in 10 contracts. And then he would essentially give up a million dollars. Because this is the extrinsic value that he would have given up that he otherwise could collect. By selling the option and then going to the open market. So from two data points. I don't believe he exercised. The first one is because the basis here doesn't match up. Again, if he exercised using this 40,000 and 10. His additional basis would have had to have been 2609 and it wasn't. So that's the first part. The second part is that he would have given up 920,000 dollars. And I just I know that he's not in it for the money is",

The second part is that he would have given up 920,000 dollars. And I just I know that he's not in it for the money is not super concerned. But I also don't think he's in the business of just throwing money away, which is literally what that is. It's just throwing it away. So I think that he wanted to monetize the calls before expiration. And one of the few instances where he actually exited relatively early, most of the other periods he exited when the option still had like no time left. So this is why I don't think he exercised his options. And this is why I think that the math leads us towards him selling the options and then buying the shares on the market. That's what I think. Magnum says, well, he did end up giving up being a millionaire, a billionaire, but makes sense. Yeah, exactly. He did give up being a billionaire. That's hilarious, but it's wild that that is the case. Did you imagine being a billionaire off of GameStop stock? Like what a story that is incredible. Absolutely incredible. I mean, that looks pretty clear to me in terms of did he exercise or did he not? And this to me overwhelmingly looks like he did not. So interesting though, very, very interesting.

Anything else we should take a look at before we wrap up for those that are typically in the normal live streams. I don't have any live streams slated for Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. I'm doing a little bit of travel. I need to go get my back looked at by a specialist. So I'm actually flying to Florida to go do that. So I will not be live streaming. I might live stream on Tuesday because we might wrap early enough, but I would be live streaming on East Coast hours. So I would probably be doing something at like 6 p.m. Their time, which would be 3 p.m. Pacific time. Something like that. So that is the the near term game plan. Now for tomorrow, I will be doing two different live streams. I'm going to do a live stream again at like 1530. That's going to be open for everybody. And that one will be like the standard market outlook that I normally would do on Monday. To kind of compensate for that. And then I'll still have the outlier pro specific live stream at 1700.

But I'm not saying it wasn't a couple mill for the bigger picture kind of thing. Was just a couple, but that's the thing is that it wasn't really. It didn't cause like a bigger picture effect. Unfortunately. So. I think the Roryntady says traveling for healthcare sucks. We might have to take my mom to Colorado. I'm actually in the opposite camp like I'm choosing to I'm for those that are in like I'm going to go see Brian Carroll. He's the guy that co authored the gift of injury with Stuart McGill.
