There's a lot of people who like the stock more than him that probably wouldn't have multiple 50 drawdowns plus while being in the stock. So that's why the patience is surprising to me because a lot of what he does from a trading perspective largely differs from the playbook of like rational trader behavior. But again, this goes back into the broader point that this is, you could tell like this was a yolo and he labeled it as such and he traded it as such. So I think the reason why he's able to do this and deal with this kind of portfolio of altilities because this isn't his entire portfolio. I don't believe I think there's a little bit more to it. SM says seems like a lot of false alarms. Okay, when you say false alarms, is that people doing like the date calling thing? I've never fully understood that yet. But is that what you mean by false alarms? Roaring Titty says a lot of people got really wrecked when Robin Hood took away the buy button. I don't understand that to be honest.",

I don't understand how Robin Hood taking the buy button away and other brokerages taking the buy button away like wrecked people because you can still sell. You can still get out. So I understand that that means that the stock didn't keep going up parabolicly. But that goes back to the thing that I've talked with Newton about and I've also talked with Peruvian Bull about where the like again, like this is why I don't fully understand that the angle sometimes because Roaring Titty says a lot of brokers went down retail couldn't do anything for a time. Is that is that accurate? Like they couldn't sell either because that actually would be very surprising to me. Now if it was frozen, limit up, limit down, then yeah, you'd have to catch it outside of the lock periods. But from what I saw, there was still order flow happening. Yeah, Jimmy says it made people lose faith in retail trading, I think. I don't know. I just, it surprises me so much.

The reason why it surprises me so much is because I don't understand how anybody in their rational mind would expect any stock, not GameStop, but any stock to go up into essentially to a point where it could collapse the financial system. I'm not saying that the conditions being set, leading to that as a possible outcome irrational, they're not. That's from a bunch of bullshit. Completely agree. No debate. But I think it's interesting to me when something that Cleary hasn't had a big change in fundamental value goes up over, you know, to over 400 bucks for multiple days and then to just kind of sit there and hold it, right? Because if I'm not mistaken, it hung up in like the multiple hundreds for a few days. Let me make sure I'm not way off base. Does trading view do like pre-adjusted split basis or whatever? It doesn't look like it. It looks like it does split adjusted. Yeah, because it was over 400 back here. Lauren says the fact that a stock going up could wreck the financial system is a little problem in my opinion. It's a huge problem. The fact that that's a thing and the fact that that was the case here is insane. And this is literally one of the shining examples of broad manipulation, like 100",

And the fact that this was at such a severe range is crazy to me that it was even allowed to be like, how can something be multiple hundreds percent short? There's only so many fucking shares. So like that stuff is so frustrating. And again, I completely agree with like those components. But again, it's so important to decouple frustrations, preferences, what we wish reality was from what reality is. And the fact that this shouldn't have been multiple 100 shorted and even in a position to be able to go up to 400 plus. That can only happen from a systemic manipulation that's being caught in unwound. So love that because I would love for those people to get wrecked. But to still again, from the practical side of things, to not exit your position on the 27th, the 28th, the 29th, the first. Like that's a that's a solid four day window to GTFO, take profits, and then wait for another run to get back in. So that's just the part that I don't understand.

Because in my opinion, if there's the intervention to prevent the collapse, then those who are systemically on the wrong side of this trade, they should go out of fucking business. And they should have to pay. Like I literally think they should go bankrupt. But that's a that's a again, that's like another part of the broader partitioning mentality that I go through. But like if this goes into a total financial collapse, then nobody makes money anyways. The stock market collapsed. So it's like I just I don't understand the broader the broader expectation there. It's from as you could tell from a trading perspective, it baffles me. But from a systematic perspective, it shows that we have massive problems, massive problems. And they're still here.

And the market cap is now growing with how much cash they have. It starts to become more difficult for that kind of manipulation to occur and then to be squeezed out like that. I think one of the big things the ape community had going for a long time was having a pretty significant amount of the float locked. But with the recent offerings, it's going to take a hot minute for retail to slowly attempt to scoop up the new float and DRS hit and lock that. And it's a pretty long process. So I have like genuinely it is completely possible. I just don't think it's likely to answer their question more specifically. So yeah, Lon Swasey says at this point, I'm wondering how many shares traded each day or just created liquidity no matter which stock, which is a fair question. That's a really fair question. And I think it's one that most people, especially now, we have a, I mean, we literally have a fucking right to ask stuff like that. Because again, the manipulation is very clear like you can see it. And it's literally out in broad daylight. That's actually why I'm really, really stoked. I don't know if any of you guys saw, but I had my boy, lower on the Dave on",

And I'm actually really, really stoked with what they're doing. And the reason why I'm stoked with what they're doing is because they're actually starting to try and make a make a fight out of this. And that makes me super happy. And it makes me happy because nobody else is really doing it at the level that they are. And it takes a lot of time and effort to do this kind of thing, which is, you know, kind of how it goes. So yeah, I think we have clear elements of manipulation. We can see it. It's there. But again, there's a reality to things that Lawrence says I'd be curious to hear updates on how that's going is just starting. So I don't think that there's really going to be any big updates for a little bit. The litigation process is going to take a long time.

It's not technically true, but it's kind of practically true. So it lets them, it lets them draw things out because for people that are hiring counsel to pursue something, that all costs money and it costs money over time. So yeah, one of the tactics that you'll find from government entities is to specifically move very slow. And again, like it or like it or not, it's fucking smart. It's really smart because they're essentially just waiting people out. Cactus Jackson, did you ever see the interview with IB Petter Fee? I'd like to point out that we have come dangerously close to the collapse of the entire system? Yeah, definitely. That's exactly one of the main things that I'm actually referencing when talking about this stuff is he saw exactly what most of us can see, which is that there is a huge, huge, huge problem here. How close we were to this system breaking something failing? How close were we Thomas? We were frighteningly close on January 28th when we had 50 million registered chairs at the same time. We had 70 million shares short and 150 million shares short via short coal options. So",

So you'd love some short calls, eh? Yeah, no. And like you said, frighteningly close. So yeah, we were on the cusp. Absolutely on the cusp. All right, cool. So let's take a look at, well, first, do we have any updates to our 8MAP? We have less people here now. So I'm concerned that the likelihood of us filling out via Madagascar or reunion or mortis. That one's also viable. What's this one? Herd Island in McDonald Islands. Others, two of them. Is that herd island? This one? A lot of names. All right, looks like our map is up to date to my chagrin. Let's take a little bit of a look at GameStop where we sit today. So we see a few things going on right now at a high level. As we can tell, we, this, I haven't redrawed anything on this for some time now. And we're very, very range bound. And it looks like perceived nominal value at this point is like mid 20s. And that's just because this is kind of like a new floor that it's been moving around within for some time now. So it's very likely the where this thing is",

And that's just because this is kind of like a new floor that it's been moving around within for some time now. So it's very likely the where this thing is starting to be accepted as a price level. Now, I find a couple things interesting. One of which is if you take a look at the move of volatility, it is collapsing. So if I move this out to a year, you can see obviously where we had that bit of a spike back in May, absolutely skyrocketed short-term vol and it started sending 30 day vol very high. And then essentially from those points, they've been steadily contracting with a couple bumps along the way, but still very much a declining line here. And volatility is just being pulled more and more out of here. So that's one of the biggest things that I see going on with GameStop is the volatility has been contracting massively. If we take a look at the movements in the at both average true range average day range, both of those are coming down massively. So if you look at the 90 day average day range, 5.29 now it's at 2.88, almost half. So across the board, it just tells us things are quieting down. Again, I don't think that's any shock to anybody, but I think it's at least worth while as",

Again, I don't think that's any shock to anybody, but I think it's at least worth while as a general data point. So taking a look at the options chain itself, it has also gotten very quiet. So there's still a two to one relationship between puts and calls, but overall volume is very, very light. And most of the oh, I at this point is actually out in 17 Jan 25. So we're not seeing a bunch of these really near term style options being thrown around anymore, whereas before the front expirations used to be really, really, really heavy. And that's just not what we're seeing now because you can even see after the 17 Jan expiration cycle, the next largest on the call side at least is 15. So we're not seeing the same centralization and like the one note of expiration cycle, the eight know so far. So yeah. Vladimir says, GME didn't close 22 or even once mid 20s are a far way off. Yes, sorry. What I meant by that is like mid 20s, like mid 20s, not mid 20 handle, but mid 20, 50 cents, 20, 60 cents. That's what I meant there. So but back to the options. Volatility is super low.

And IV percentile, this use I've uses IV rank, but IV percentiles 13 IV rank is five and three quarters. So vol, vol across the board just siphoned out very, very low. Let's take a quick look and see if there is anything that came through from an interesting order flow perspective. I didn't see much that caught my eye, but we'll take a peek. DJT on the other hand has been crazy. And let's look at that last seven days. So I mean, there's a little bit going on, but not a ton. And a lot of these are still a little bit on the smaller side as pretty like what we've seen when things start getting really, really active. So that's what I'm seeing at a high level.

This looks like a solid tattoo. That's a good artist. The problem with red though is the red won't last. That's the downside. The red starts to fade in. I have a little bit of red on this one. It's still good, but it's faded in. This one has some white on it. That is like essentially completely gone. Wow, okay. Dude, the comments in this are fucking crazy. Okay. Okay. I think we're good. That's entertaining enough. All right.",

Dude, the comments in this are fucking crazy. Okay. Okay. I think we're good. That's entertaining enough. All right. So let's see where we had left off here. All right. So we had saw those series of trades leading into this that looked like he was kind of like testing positions. And then I don't remember. It's been a while now. What we thought the exit. Rowan Titty says it's funny. His tweet was about Trump, but all everyone saw were tips. Oh, you know. See, that's the kind of thing that you know. Like what I mean is you know, you know Ryan Cohen specifically did that. You know that. And again, the reason why I know that is because he makes it obvious enough that you can pick it up, right? It's not like this insanely deep message that takes people years to figure out. It's pretty superficial, pretty easy to pick up. So like if you look at the stuff that he tweets, he's just a troll. He just likes to fuck around. And I've seen that. And that's again, from that same interview that we've watched a few times. I think we can see that there as well. Where the dude just likes to fuck around. He likes to troll, which is hilarious to me.",

So for his, for the cats, trades here, wait, where did we, is this all the way caught up? 13 June. Okay. So we got through all of it. And where the exit here, I think that there was a lot of debate whether or not he exercised or not. I don't remember what the ending solution was. Vampirita says we're caught up. Seven know of hype date from Newton. I mean, I definitely hope that works. I don't really, I don't really do the whole, I don't do the whole hype date thing. But maybe. Yes, so let's see what happened in here. 567 54 20. So basis would be what 25? 2567? So the Vampirita says you put in the data, but then analyze the June ones. There we go. Thank you. Okay. Yeah, let's do that. So we know that these went on between 10 and no, that's a lie. That's a big bold face lie. We know that they went on between, oh, I forgot. We don't know when they went on. All right, let's figure that out. Let's get to the bond with that. Um, so sometime between",

I'm going to get rid of the puts. Yeah. Yeah. So these look like these look like him. What is this 10? Okay. So first thing I'm going to do is just try to isolate the by 5,000 order blocks. I'm not going to use the bid, mid or ask. I'm literally just going to count all of the 5,000 order blocks. And so we need size to be minimum 5,000. And I mean, we could just do some counting one. These don't count. Yeah, I'm going to do the 20s as well. As some says, what is the cat do all day long? Probably hangs out with this family and looks at the markets like I do. I'd a lot of us that are full-time graders do the same do the same bit. One, two, three. So there's 25 total. Which gets us to 125. So he had 120. I wonder if he sold one",

This clearly follows his pattern. Again, this is the process of fingerprinting. You can pretty clearly start to figure out people's tendencies and behaviors. And one of them that I can clearly see is he starts early with a couple small stuff. Like this is the other version that we looked at a while ago. This one is that middle version that we kind of tested. We were sort of curious about what we think might be him, but not sure. So this is just confirming that what we just did here. That's what this is up here. But he's done this multiple times where we see him scaling in small and then building building into the position. And then this one we missed. I don't know which one we left off of here. How many are in this one? So we have that two, three. So 21 May is where we left it out of this version. But I think this one was close to, closer to netting out. So we know what the residual basis was here for the position.",

So we know what the residual basis was here for the position. We did all that stuff. So let's take a look. I want to specifically. Fun all on the unwind between 10 and 13 June. So the first thing we can easily do is just go between 10 and 14 June. So I don't see size here that would indicate. Yeah, no, I don't see size here that would indicate him exiting by selling. My hunch. Vladimir says, but depending on volume couldn't limit orders be broken into smaller blocks. That happens to me. Yeah, they can be. But you can still aggregate them together. So a lot of times, depending on what we're looking at, you'll actually see that with those little stacked figure that will be in between these. It's like a little stacked icon. That's pulling together multiple trades that then. That are aggregated up, but they were individual positions. Because my instinct here. Would be that he would have sold. I don't see them here. But that's still my. My guess is that he would have sold. And the reason for that is because he still had enough time on these options. Well, I mean, he definitely sold some of them. We know he did.

I'm so suspective data now after doing a lot of this stuff. Okay, so you said 12 June, here, which is Wednesday. So you still fucking lied to me, but we're still closer. 12 June is Wednesday. Rantitty says that says 2568 closing price of GME on 12 June is 2546. No, so this, this shows if he exercised. So if he exercised, this is what his basis, that's what this number here should be. If he exercised, this represents the variance between the added cost and the added shares. Not the variance, it represents the variance between these two posts. What was on 10 June? What was on 13 June? The delta between these. So the change in his cost basis from 21274 to 234135 and by adding 4 million 1000 shares, this is what his basis would be.

That's why on brokerage platforms, it'll actually show you like total commissions and fees as a line item. So this is all encompassing whatever the platform tracks. So Magnum says, didn't he have 20 options that he got dirt cheap premium and could exercise? It's not so much about the premium being cheap. He's still would have left a massive amount of time value left in the options. So we can take a look at an example of this together. Let's go to 11 June. Here. 24 June. Which will 11? Actually, you don't even have to go to 11. Let's go to 13th. When we know we got out, this will be the. This will be a better. Roryntady says wasn't there only a week left. There was only a week left. But again, I'll show you what I mean. This is the cool part of options. So let's go to 20, not 26, that's today's date. I again, I'm an idiot. So 13 June. And right now, he has the what is it? The 21 July? 20 calls. So let's take a look. And I'll show you why I don't think he did exercise. And Newton and I, we had a long debate about this because Newton also thinks that he exercised. But I think that's just",

And Newton and I, we had a long debate about this because Newton also thinks that he exercised. But I think that's just because Newton doesn't fully understand options. And he was the I think the thing Newton was doing there was pattern seeking. It was confirmation bias. He wanted them to exercise because of Newton's perception of what that would mean in terms of creating like another wave potentially. But I don't think mathematically it lines up. Again, just from calculating the residual basis, we already see his basis would have to be on average 26 or nine. But more importantly, let's take a look at his options, which were the 21 June's. And he had the 20s. So let's actually do the math here. And let's not do the lazy back of the napkin way of doing this. So right now, GameStop is trading at 28 5 6 9 9. His 20 calls. He has 20 calls. Titi says, could he have rolled his options? No, he could not because they would be here. So the fact that they're not here tells me he didn't roll them. Right now, his 20 calls are trading for 8.80. So now if we break this intrinsic versus extrinsic value. Oh, because the vaults so fucked up, I don't even know what they would have",

Oh, because the vaults so fucked up, I don't even know what they would have classified it as. Interesting. So it's like 23 cents, something like that. So then if we have 23 cents on again, it wouldn't be the full because again, we know that he didn't exercise all 120,000. Right. That's again, it's just an objective fact because he only added 4 million 1000 shares. So for him to get to that, he could have done 40,000 and 10. This is what if we take the exercise scenario, this is what he would have exercised. And the issue with this is this is his extrinsic value here. I'll create some labels. Intrinsic equals this minus this. So this is his intrinsic value. So this is going back to basic options. And I can zoom this in a little bit to make it easier to see. So he could have exercised up to 40,000 and 10. If he did that, this is what would have happened. He would have taken this 40,000 in 10 contracts. And then he would essentially give up a million dollars. Because this is the extrinsic value that he would have given up that he otherwise could collect by selling the option and then going to the open market. So",

Because this is the extrinsic value that he would have given up that he otherwise could collect by selling the option and then going to the open market. So from two data points, I don't believe he exercised. The first one is because the basis here doesn't match up. Again, if he exercised using this 40,000 and 10, his additional basis would have had to have been 20609 and it wasn't. So that's the first part. The second part is that he would have given up 920,000 dollars. And I just I know that he's not in it for the money is not super concerned, but I also don't think he's in the business of just throwing money away, which is literally what that is. It's just throwing it away. So I think that he wanted to monetize the calls before expiration. This is one of the few instances where he actually exited relatively early. Most of the other periods he exited when the option still had like no time left. So this is why I don't think he exercised his options. And this is why I think that the math leads us towards him selling the options and then buying the shares on the market. That's what I think.
