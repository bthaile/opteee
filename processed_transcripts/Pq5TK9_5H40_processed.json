I'm just kidding, but you really do. You really seem to do a little bit of everything, which is awesome, but I'm here with Bob Wheeler. I was actually on your podcast pretty recently and I literally love the conversation. Like I was just telling you before we started the recording, you are one of those gems that makes talking about tax engaging and I think there's a lot you bring to the table. So first off, thank you so much for, you know, since some time aside to come talk to us. Well, absolutely. I love talking about taxes. I love talking about money. We all think about it. So my is well at least make it a little bit fun. Yeah. So and I think the perfect intro is a lot of people when they think about taxes, right? We, it's not really something a lot of people want to dive into. It's complicated. It's busy. There's not, it's not very fun paying taxes. So how the hell did you become a CPA? What threw you in that direction? Well, you know, I wanted to be a lawyer and then I met a few lawyers and I was like, yeah, I don't want to do that. So I was actually taking accounting classes just to help my great point",

And I was like, and of course, it's not something you can go into if it's easy because it's got to be painful if you're going to make money. So but ultimately, ultimately, I accounting was something that I really enjoyed and came easy. But you know, as I got into my tax practice, I just realized so many people had so many issues. And the truth is, so did I. I was telling other people follow these rules, but then I wasn't following them because I had an excuse in a story and a mindset. And so once I started looking at my own personal mindset and self-sabotage around money. And I started talking with my clients, mostly that are entrepreneurs and people making nice incomes, getting into their stories because even like this last week has been tax deadlines and so many clients, even though they're making a half million dollars, generating a million dollars in grocery revenue, they're like, this is the worst year ever.

But I have actually found that exact thing that literally I was just talking to my accountant last week. And the conversations I have with him, it always feels like a very team team project. And one of the things I noticed from his perspective, and I'm curious if you identify it with this is that yes, there are the rules. But then it seems like every, you know, client has like its individual puzzle pieces that you're trying to move. Do you view it as a puzzle or how do you view, you know, the list of issues that you're trying to solve for your clients? Yeah, absolutely. It's definitely a puzzle. And every person is unique. And so I need to know the story. So when I'm gonna tax return, when the government looks at it, it needs to at least in theory feel like a nonfiction, right? Right? Maybe it based on a true story. But I want to go in there and get the facts. And so I was explaining to somebody the other day, a high profile person who has his account is not writing certain things off.",

I you're hitting like the things that I look for in the county, which is actually one of my future questions because one of the things that I found early on is like everybody else, I was super cheap and I wanted to do my own taxes. And I actually think for simple tax profiles, it's a good exercise because you at least understand some of it. But then when I started doing the YouTube stuff and the trading and all these other things, I found, okay, like this is getting kind of heavy. And when I had my first conversation with one of the accountants, I was kind of interviewing not for the channel, but like for my business. And they made it sound like, oh, I try to follow the letter of the law, stay away from audits, stay as far away. I never get audited, nothing like that. And I'm sitting there thinking like, that seems like an interesting approach.

If you're buying stuff at Victoria's Secret, unless you're a model, it's probably not a write-off. Maybe if you're on a MyFans page or something like that, you might talk about my business like that. That's another business. You got to do what you got to do. You got to do what you got to do. I just had to pay 690 from a utility bill. That only fans page really needs to get pop and suit. Exactly. But yes, so that's what we're doing. We're trying to look at those areas where, where can we maximize and does it make sense? And there's other places where I'm like, you know, you did not spend 80,000 in dry cleaning. You will work at a bank. Right. So one of the fascinating things about your story is obviously the line between comedian and CPA. Those seem like dichotomies. I have got to know like how those two exist in the same ecosystem for you. Well, you know, it's funny. Bob Newhart is my role model. He was a CPA. Working for the sales department.

But I can use it as a way to play around and get information from people to just relax them because people do come in very tense when they're meeting with their CPAs most of the time. Yeah. And I think the other correlation that I consider is the fact that, you know, you talked about that gray area in a CPI, which in or a CPA, like when you're looking at taxes, and in my mind, I'm thinking like, that's there's some creative license in there to see what kind of story you could tell. So I could totally see how those two actually play off of each other specifically a comedian to CPA. That's actually a really good structure, I think. So when I think about traders in general, which is most of my people, you know, we hate taxes just like everybody else. And we expose ourselves to additional tax, right?

One of the things that I see traders talk about is wash sales and tax harvesting. So I want to talk about a couple of those specific concepts with you and to get your thought process. So wash sales, could you walk us through, you know, you don't even have to speak to me like I'm five, because I mentally, so just speak to me and tell me, you know, what wash sales are in your world. Yeah. So wash sale is, you know, a lot of times we'll sell off stock to create a loss so we can take that loss to offset some gains, because maybe we just don't have any faith in that that stocks can ever recover. And so we might do that, or we might sell some stuff, we might sell some stock off, take the loss, and then repurchase some stock thinking, oh, I'll get that loss. However, there's this wash sale rule that says if you do that within 30 days, and you turn around and sell that, we're not going to give you the loss. You're not going to get that right now. And so what happened in",

And so what happened in the last couple of years is I had a couple clients with four, five, six hundred thousand dollars worth of wash sales. They were correctly thinking, create if I generate a loss, I can take it against my other capital gains, what they didn't realize was I needed to wait more than 30 days. And so there is a big disconnect. And when we got to the taxes, I'm like, well, you've got a million dollar gain. And they're like, no, you did it wrong. No, you did it wrong. You weren't paying attention to the 30 day rule. And so if you're going to be trading for people out there that they're just starting, have some conversations, do a little research, find out what a long term and a short term capital gain is. The tax isn't always 15. And even though it might be 15, it might also be plus 4 for the additional investment tax that gets added on that a lot of people don't factor in. And if you're making over a couple hundred thousand dollars, these are some extra taxes you got to be careful about. And so a lot of my clients are like,",

So basically anything held a year or less, you know, is, is a short term capital gain. And that means you're going to, whatever tax bracket you're in, that's the tax you're paying. Now you might be in the 24 tax bracket and effectively paying 17 because it's a graduated table. But the fact of the matter is, you know, some of these clients of mine will get RSU's, they'll get all these stock options and things. And they get added to their paycheck. And so their W2 will say they made a million dollars. And they're like, they made a mistake. I only made 400,000. Well, 600,000 is short term capital gains basically that you're paying on that later on when you sell the stock, you'll have basis. Right. But in that moment, you're paying ordinary income tax. And so it's really important to know that GFI wait two days, if I can wait two days and pay that lower tax rate, I definitely want to do it. And so I think again, people are just not aware of,",

And they're like, no, no, no, I lost 100,000. I get to write off 100,000. Do you have 100,000 worth of capital gains? No, you're going to be writing off 3,000.

    "text": "than 3,000, right? Unless you've released some passive losses from the sale of some real estate or something like that. But for the most part, you can only offset your losses against capital gains. And then plus three. And I think there's a big disconnect there. The example that I give is I had a client who had a million dollars worth of capital losses. Somebody walked in and offered to pay him 3,000 million for his house. And he had after his exemptions and everything, he had a million dollar capital gain. Well, he paid no tax on that because the stock happened the year before the house happened the next year. Now, if he had reversed that and he had sold the house in the first year, and then he lost a million dollars, he would have paid tax on the million. And then he would have written off 3,000 a year until eternity. Right. And so it's so important to pay attention to that capital loss piece because I had another client who was buying appreciating stock, buying appreciating stock, very risky stuff, ultimately lost about 7,800,000. Then the financial advisor moved them into high dividend stocks. So now to sudden she's getting 80,000 in dividends. And I'm writing off 3,000 a year on this 700,000. I finally called the broker and I said, Hey, you got an understand. I need you to be buying appreciating stock, not stock that's paying dividends. They're like, Oh, got it.",

I to be honest, I love that you bring that up. And I find for myself, I'll talk to my accountant at least quarterly, typically even more than that, at least via email and stuff because some of the timing things that you brought up, especially the one about the house and the capital loss, like that is really important for people because that is a huge difference in what the money you take home looks like. So I think little things like that are so incredibly useful. Now I want to ask your thoughts on something. I lament the tax harvesting mindset for traders. It bothers me. But from your background, specifically coming at this from like a money psychology perspective, when you think about it, obviously there is a benefit to that in terms of the overall tax picture.

But I've had clients where real estate would really help them and they will say my dad was in real estate. It was a nightmare. I will never do it just because dealing with tenants. So that just means you need to find somebody to manage the properties or invest in a reate, right? Like you could still get into real estate and not have to be the property manager.

But yeah, I do think and I personally have found tremendous value in it, especially over when I was doing my own taxes, even when my own taxes were simple. So I genuinely think you guys are worth your weight and gold. And speaking of that, one of the things I love talking to CPAs about is you have the perspective to see what lots of people are doing with their money and what really successful people are doing, what moderately successful people are doing. I would love to, you know, in obviously, I know you can't get super far in a detail, but from like a high level overview, what are some of the common threads you see very successfully financially speaking people doing that maybe, other people would need to be privy to or would like to be privy to? So I think that a lot of people invest in real estate. And even if they're not managing it themselves, they're either, I mean, some people put money in reads, I don't see that as much, but I do see people buying in real estate and having somebody else take care of that. The other big thing I would say is that a lot of people do have their brokerage accounts, but they don't manage them themselves.

Now, unless you've got the time and you want to be a trader in things like that, that's different, but a lot of my clients are trying to create their business or come up with the next big thing and they don't have time and paying somebody that money, that one or two percent to keep growing their portfolio. Those are the people that I see significant growth for the most part. And I also, which great is I have a few clients that will say, can you just look at my portfolio and tell me that they made me a lot of money or it's worth paying them the 2 because they seem expensive. Now, one of the things I think it's important to think about in terms of a financial advisor, their job, in my opinion, isn't to make you millions of dollars. If you've got millions of dollars, their job is to preserve it. And to then grow it, but not in a way that's irresponsible.

Make sure they feel comfortable to you because I had a client who really wanted to get into investing. They were nervous to come to a broker that I knew I said, leave the money in a savings account for six months before you do any investing. Sure, sure, sure. Three months later, they've invested it in something. It loses 20,000. His 100,000 loses 20,000. And I called up the broker and I was like, what did you do? You just broke his trust. And the broker says to me, it was a sure thing. And I said, well, if it was a sure thing, there'd be 20,000 more in his bank account. It's not a sure thing. And so, of course, that guy never wanted to invest his money again, ever again, and he didn't trust anybody. And of course, I never used that broker again. It's all about trust.

So now, I do also have clients that invest in silver and gold and stuff like that, precious metals. I don't see that as much. I like investing in that stuff because I'm assuming the apocalypse is coming. I live in LA. I want to have little silver coins to buy my food. But that's, you know, that's the, you know, that's my, the world is not coming to an end. But just in case it does, I'm going to have lots of little silver coins. Hopefully those are still in, in Vogue at that point. Exactly.

One of the things I'm curious about, we were talking just a little bit about kind of the psychology there behind different financial choices. And one of the things I feel like is a lot of my generation, I'm a millennial, I'm 31, but it feels like a lot of us are very risk averse. And I'm curious if you see that kind of thing from your side of the equation. Yeah, I mean, nobody really likes to lose money. For the most part, I mean, there are maybe a few people that find joy in it. But, I don't, no, I think most people are risk averse, especially as they've started to accumulate a little bit. You know, I got a hundred bucks and I lose a hundred bucks, who cares? You know, I'm buying some penny stock right now. It's 1500 bucks. I lose 1500 bucks, who cares? If it turns out to be 800,000 sweet. But like, but other stuff, you know, even myself, even though I know don't get emotional about investments, you know, I put some money into a couple of funds.

What is not worth the purchase for me? And where's the marginal utility? And I think you hit on a good, a good bit of that there. So a couple other questions I wanted to ask you. Obviously, you know, there's all different kinds of CPAs out there, different philosophies, different approaches to taxes. But if you were to summarize your approach to tax in general, what are, like, how would you summarize it? Like, what's your general strategy? So my strategy is let's figure out how to avoid taxes. I love working with entrepreneurs because I've got corporations. I've got structures in place that I can use to my advantage. You know, I don't really work with a lot of W2 people because I can't do a whole lot. Unless you've got rental property and things like that. So I want to, I work with people with more complicated returns because I can actually make a difference there. But somebody can walk in making 500,000 on a W2. I can't do anything for you. There's nowhere to go. And so we work with people as a team. I don't look at tax returns as",

So I'm in a thousand different relationships because I've got a thousand clients. And I actually care as much or more than they do when they're paying taxes. You know, if they owe a bunch of money that we didn't foresee, I am like, oh my god, that's so painful. Yeah, I'm not writing the check. But I have compassion and empathy for my clients who even though they know they made the money psychologically, they didn't put the money aside. They were just like, oh, it won't be that bad. And then when we see the numbers, they're like, oh, my goodness. And so I feel for them because I know they're not sitting around going, I should be putting away 25 every day. And oh, I need, we're not all sitting around thinking about taxes. It's my job. So I am always thinking about taxes. Oh, that's going to come back and oh, we need to plan for this.

Obviously, you know, you already have a thousand clients, there's going to be people that need a Bob Wheeler in their life, maybe they're in Florida, maybe there's somewhere else. What are some of the things you think people should look for when they're shopping for an accountant or a CPA, you know, when they're trying to make that jump? What are some of the qualities you think are useful for people to keep an eye out for? Well, one of the first things I think is important to ask if I'm in real estate. I want to know if the accountants got real estate. I want to know that they've had to actually deal with real time personally, with having to deal with the limitation of the 25,000, or having to deal with a 1031 exchange, or any of those things that are real estate. If I've got a lot of stocks and I've got all kinds of passive income and K1s, I want to make sure that that's something that they're comfortable with.",

And one of the things that's been great for me is I didn't want to be this standalone guy that worked out of his bedroom and his underwear doing 100 tax returns and calling it a day. I wanted to have other CPAs around me. I wanted to have a staff. And so I built a practice. And a lot of CPAs go into accounting because it's very logical. And so they're going to play it as safe as they can. They're going to not cross a line. They're going to stay 10 feet from the line. Well, if the line's over there, I'm going to move 10 feet and I'm going to touch the line. I'm not going to cross the line. And so I think some CPAs are just very not willing. They're so conservative. I don't understand it. Therefore, you can't take a deduction. I had a client come to me and we were looking at the returns and I said, you know, you've paid about 20,000, 30,000 for the last five years more than you should have.

Like you had this amazing year, you had this amazing year, then all of a sudden this happens and then what happens? And so we started talking it out and she realized that when she loses all of her money, her mom comes in and saves her. And her mom really loves to come in and show her that she's her savior, savior. And that's how she knows her mom loves her. And so I said, ah, that's a really long way to get an I love you. And then once she realized that she went, oh my God. Yeah, I could just ask my mom, hey, do you still love me? Right? I don't need to run the business into the ground to see if she'll come to my rescue. But that was the old story was mom will rescue me. And that's how I know she loves me. Once we got real clear on that, she was able to then say, okay, now I'm aware of what I'm doing. But when she would start to get depressed, nobody loves me, my life sucks. She would just slowly start self sabotaging the business so she could get to a place of mom's going to save me.

And I said to them, look, your business is not working. People aren't paying you. You don't enjoy that. You love doing what you do. Right. You should take this job, close down your company. The lease is coming up. This is the perfect time to walk away and transition and really make bank. He said, my mom will be so disappointed. I can't, I can't do this proactively. So in essence, he made a choice to let it. Yeah. He just, and so he let the business fail, but it wasn't his fault. He didn't walk away. Of course.

But obviously you see this very like in-depth emotional side to this stuff. I wouldn't have guessed either of those stories.

That's what I'm trying to do. But I'll share my own personal self-sabotage. So I've just sit for the CPA exam and you have to get a 70, 75 or 76 to pass. And yeah, that's all you need. That's all you need. We're almost, we're almost just like the Marine Corps. Not kidding. But I would go in and I'm like, man, if I can just get 75. So I would get 75 of 75. I wouldn't pass.

I wasn't bad, but I wasn't good. Right. And I randomly just decided to stop allowing myself to say that. And then suddenly during my undergrad and grad, I took a bunch of statistics courses and it was off to the races. I still am not a savant at math, but I'm competent. And I love that you are even willing to share that kind of story because I think that a lot of people exhibit, again, both of us, right.

It's always been there for me when everything else wasn't and it's something that I'm good at. And so that's been something that just gives me comfort. But the reality is I love people. I like being with people. I like connecting with people. And for me, it's a way that I can help people in an industry where not everybody is willing to help. And I think most of my clients get that I'm advocating for them and that I actually really care about them as a person. I actually care more about making sure they feel good about what we've done than me making an extra 300 bucks. I'd rather lose 500 bucks or wave the fee on a tax return than feel like I've given up my integrity. And I think people hopefully resonate with that. But you know, I like helping people.
