    "text": "What's up, Allies? We got a quick market update with three things on the agenda. We're going to talk about Nike's earnings and how things are moving after hours because there's probably a trade to be had tomorrow. We're going to talk about the current state of affairs in the Middle East, touching really quick, mostly on the market impacts, but giving an update on what's going on there. And then we're going to touch on in video really fast because we saw some really interesting price movement there as well today. And then for the GME folks, my fellow apes, don't worry. We will have a game stop video out tomorrow. A couple of things popped up today that I really want to cover from a broader market perspective, but I obviously have not forgotten about you. Okay. So let's get into this. What's going on first and foremost? First, I guess the easiest, not so much foremost, but the easiest is Nike. So Nike did have earnings and it had a bit of a pullback. So if we take a look after hours as it sits now, Nike closed that 8913 and right now it's trading right around 84. So not a massive drop, not an inconsequential drop. We're looking right now about 5 ish, depending on how we choose to open tomorrow. And Nike's been struggling for a little bit, right? Last earnings came in also quite soft comparatively. So if we take a look, it came",

And Nike's been struggling for a little bit, right? Last earnings came in also quite soft comparatively. So if we take a look, it came in 99 EPS versus 85 cents. So it beat, but take a look at the guidance market did not like the guidance cratered. And then if we take a look at today, it came in at 70 cents versus 51 cents. So again, beat on EPS pretty well, but it's the guidance again, that plagues us not the deployment within EPS for that specific quarter. So what happened here? Well, we can see that there's the article here's talking about sluggish demand. And it says that we also have John Donahoe is stepping down on 13 October. This happened last month. But I think that there's just a bit of turmoil. That's what this is highlighting is that there's change going on. And we need to see a bit of a transition. And again, you can see that highlighting here. So I'll read this to you. This is from the executive VP and the CFO. It says a comeback at this scale takes time.

Our teams are energized as Elliott Hill returns to lead Nike's next stage of growth. So overall, they're talking about a bit of a turnaround Cinderella story. But you can see down here at the numbers don't lie typically, right? So net income came in 1.05 billion 70 cents per share. And it essentially came in at 1.45 billion year over year. And again, it's really important to compare year over year because there's a lot of seasonality differences. So this is the kiss of death here. Sales starting to contract. Now, I want to be clear when I say kiss of death, I don't mean Nike's going bankrupt, anything like that. But this is the market doesn't like this. We do not like seeing sales go down. And we can tolerate a lot of stuff if sales and pipeline still looks okay, but this does not. So what does this look like for tomorrow? Well, for me, this actually looks like probably a great open entry to trade the down move because my guess is that we're going to see a bit of a down move tomorrow. Obviously, we'll probably gap down a little bit on the open. But my expectation is that there would be a little bit of a continuation for",

But my expectation is that there would be a little bit of a continuation for me. These kinds of trades are very, very short term. I'm not looking to stay in the trade much longer than a day. I will look to trade the prolonged down move in this instance, probably a little more actively because we can see that I mean, it's been in a bit of a decline for the last six months. Let's take a look at the last year. Yeah. I mean, it's been contracting. So I actually wouldn't mind holding this to the downside for a little bit longer as I look at this. But it'll probably be a relatively short term trade overall looks interesting to me. Okay. So now let's pivot over and talk about what's happening from a bit more of a macro perspective. And for this, I'm actually going to pull up the futures so that you can see a few things happening here. The E minis had a bit of a down day, queues down, Russell down, VIX up. So what's happening right now actually is a few events coming together. We do have some disturbances going on in the Middle East, which we can talk about now. And it's mostly between Israel and kind",

We do have some disturbances going on in the Middle East, which we can talk about now. And it's mostly between Israel and kind of its neighbors that Israel tends to struggle with. So you can see down here, Israel began a limited ground assault into Lebanon. I ran, launched a ballistic missile attack. I'm not covering live news of the war or the conflict in and of itself, although I fall that stuff very closely from my military background. The main thing I'm approaching this dialogue from is from a market perspective. So you have this going on. We also have the strike that just started that looks like it's probably not going to be a massive impact just yet if it can be contained. But that does add pressure to things. So right now, if we look across the market in general, things are a bit mixed. And we did see some decent economic data come in. So right here, you can see job openings. They rose 329 K to 8 or 804 million. So labor market generally looks okay because you can see the expectation there. And then we can also see manufacturing though came in lighter than expected. So this continues to go down the path of mixed news. So what does this mean short term volatility? That's essentially it.",

There are things that are not performing very well. The name of the game for me is to kind of discern between them pretty carefully. This goes over to the strike as we talked about. So you can see that ports from Maine to Texas shut down. And this is the first strikes since 1977. They were asking for like a 77 pay increase, I think. And they were granted. I want to say up to a 50 pay increase, which is pretty good. Yeah, down here. So the opening offer, 77 pay raise over a six year contract. The base salaries 81 K. And I don't know, seems like a lot. I don't know. Monday evening, the alliance says that it increased its offer to 50 raises over six years. So still 25 off of this. So this is like a actually kind of a pretty big deal. And we can see, but take a look down here. This is what I thought was interesting. So we can see that Joe Biden under the 1947 Taft Hartley Act could seek a court order for an 80 day cooling off",

So we can see that Joe Biden under the 1947 Taft Hartley Act could seek a court order for an 80 day cooling off period that would suspend the strike. And they essentially approached him with this said, are you thinking about doing this? And he said, no. And he says, because it's collective bargaining. And I don't believe in Taft Hartley. Interesting. So the name of the game now for this is to monitor impact because it's early stages. I definitely would offer that what we're seeing in the Middle East is a much higher near term impact. We can see that represented in crude oil, flying off the handle today. And we can even see things like gold starting to show a little bit of life. Well, a little bit more life, I should say it's been doing really well, but starting to take up a little bit more. Okay, last thing I want to cover is a look at Nvidia. And Nvidia today was actually kind of interesting. So if we take a peak in here, we can see that it was down 3.66 and it's down again after hours to 116. So this I think is topical because this starts to look like a failed trend reversal to me. It's too early to tell, but we have a high. We",

It's too early to tell, but we have a high. We have a lower high. We have a lower high. And now so far, we have another lower high. The thing that started to look like a bit of a reversal was we had a low, a higher low, depending on where this goes, this could show a higher low. And that starts to kind of push us into this tiny little range that then a breakout normally will occur one way or the other. But we're starting to get scrunched way down in here as we're moving along. And this failed new high, I think is kind of important to keep an eyeball on because if we take a look across the cues in general, we saw cues break a new high here. And now it's starting to fall back into this range. So across technology writ large, we're kind of seeing this cycle where technology is still struggling to some degree in order to form back to near term high recovery, which is just not there yet.
