    "text": "Money cannot buy you happiness, poverty can't buy you anything. That's really the path for most traders is unsuccessful production of capital, meaning we're actually losing money. If you think about creating wealth in terms of a broader plan, there are a handful of really important concepts that I'm going to share with you, three of them to be specific. And these are the exact things that I've used coming from a single mom in a low income area to being a multi-millionaire before I'm 32. And that's not some sort of big flex. I am a Neanderthal just like most other traders. The point I'm trying to highlight here is that it is entirely possible to find your way into a different trajectory if you are thoughtful about what you do. What's up everybody? Eric here will come back to all the outliers, shout out to the YouTube members and the Patreon fam. Thank you guys for supporting the channel and let's get right into it. The very first thing that you are going to see here are some things that you're not going to want to hear and it's whatever it is what it is. The very first thing, the 5,000 account, the 10,000 account that you start with is not going to be your future wealth. So this idea of starting with a small amount of money and trading it into a huge amount of money just sets you up or failure to the highest probability. Do",

This money is your starting capital. This is not what's going to be your retirement. Or really on, obviously, the inverse here is saving. Saving is the hands down most important lever you're going to pull on early. No, that's not sexy. No, that's not fun to hear. It's the reality because most of us are not special. What I mean by that is yes, we might think we can pick up the skill set of trading. We might think that we have a high propensity to be super successful at it. We have the skills that might lend us to that success. However, this is the reality. Most people do not. Most people are posting on Wall Street bets that please help. I've not slept in days because their position is down 47 over the course of a few days. This is the reality. So what I offer to you is while you might be special, you might have the proclivity to be fantastic at trading. You don't really know it upfront and most of us aren't.

So I would avoid landing on the fact that you are rainman for your future wealth. What I mean by that is focusing on a more probabilistic outcome. That's what I did. So what does that actually mean? Well, we need to take a look at a few things. The first one is the compound growth calculator. I've done a bunch of videos on these. But what I want to highlight here is this is starting with 20,000 at a 12 yield annual for 20 years. Notice the 100 a month contribution gets you to 280,000. The 1,000 a month gets you to 1 million. What does this tell you? Saving. Saving is incredibly important. Now, the ability to change this interest rate by getting better at trading is important. But saving is accessible to all of us. The variable that is this in terms of the interest rate you're able to produce as a trader, it's a bigger variable, and again, statistically speaking, most people are not going to help reform the market. It's a pill that's hard to swallow, but it's an important one to acknowledge. The other thing is conservative estimates. When I'm filling in these things like the monthly contribution to figure out where I want to be in X number of years, I'm not",

I'm going to plan conservatively. That includes both the yield and the monthly contribution. But what I'm highlighting here is trying to create a realistic target for you. The only way all of this can happen is if we embrace this delayed gratification. And you might be saying to yourself, Eric, it doesn't seem like you're delaying gratification. And you're right. At this point, I've delayed gratification long enough to be able to afford things that I enjoy from automotive to trips to Kauai, to trips dive trips to Curacao, to a 2 million house in Southern California. All of that comes down to careful planning. And it starts with delayed gratification. The better you can, the better job you can do with this early on, the bigger the impacts you're going to see on these numbers. Because again, even if you're a really great trader, you can drive the yield of your returns up. The more you can turn this number up, the better the results are going to be more quickly.

The other thing I want to highlight on this page is paper trading. This is another thing that everybody hates, but going back to the idea that we are not special. The whole idea of trading is we think we can outperform the market. You think you could do better than the market. We know statistically that that is a small subset of traders that can do that. But what does that mean? We think we can do something that a lot of people try and they fail at. That means you're special. But I'm just saying we're not special. So how does this happen? You've got to develop the skillset. It's just like if you do any sort of martial arts, there are times when somebody with very little experience can walk in like John Jones. He can train for a relatively short period of time and you could just start crushing people. That exists. Guess what? Life is in fair. Most of us don't fall into that category and we have to work our asses off to find that same level of success. That's what this is. The whole idea of paper trading is to make sure that we are developing this skill set while avoiding some of these big pitfalls. And that's what",

Cool. The problem is good traders make it look easy. That's the skill gap so it can be very misleading. That's one of the issues with trading in general.

They want to be able to blame things so they don't have a trading log. And essentially we just go in circles because our ego prevents us from making good decisions and making sure that we're controlling things. The problem with this is you're not going to gain any traction. If you do not have a trading plan and if you do not have a trading log that is documenting your capacity and your success in paper trading, you are putting your head in the sand.

They have a 30 return, a negative 25 return, then a 12 14 12 returns. By all accounts, that's a pretty damn solid series of returns and it's an average return of 8.6. Look at the compound annual growth rate. Look at the ending value. They have an 8.6 average average return, a 6.87 Kagger, but 140k. Let's take a look at portfolio one. 10 20. I'm sorry, 10 10 2 10 5 returns. Now, one of these cracks, even the lowest positive return over here. However, the average return is 7.4. It's less than the average return over here. Look at the compound annual growth rate. 7.35 compared to 6.87. That means that on these smaller returns, you have made more money than this person",

Like many, I came from a single mom who struggled - yet I became a multi-millionaire in my early 30s.\n\nI\u2019ve no secret tricks or \"easy money\" strategies. I carefully studied, planned, tracked results, and optimized my performance - and I openly share my journey. \n\nI built the Outlier Community to connect you with other driven people who are disinterested in average and focused on creating their optimal futures.
