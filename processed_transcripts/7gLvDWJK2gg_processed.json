    "text": "Rolling options and how it actually works. I thought we were past this. I really thought we were on to bigger and better things and then when I was looking for my next video idea, I just threw into YouTube rolling options and I want to show you something because it's actually scary. The amount of misinformation around this concept is staggering and it promotes some of the most unhealthy options trading habits that exist. So I want to walk you through exactly what I'm seeing, why it's blatantly wrong and then I'm going to walk you through in depth what rolling options actually is. So at the end of the video, there's a little quiz that I want to see if you're following along and staying up to speed. So what's up everybody? Eric here will come back to all the outliers shout out to the Patreon family. You guys make content like this possible and let's talk about rolling some options. Hopefully for the last time I doubt it though for being honest. Okay, so as I said, I threw rolling options into Google. I'm not trying to pick on nobody. I literally put in the words rolling options and these are the first two videos that popped up for me. The first one says option rolling strategy is free money. How to roll options for beginners free money. That's fucking news to me. That sounds pretty sick. But I get through down free money. I'll have to",

That's fucking news to me. That sounds pretty sick. But I get through down free money. I'll have to check that video out. And then the second video here is avoid losses by rolling options. That also sounds pretty fucking sick to me too. Both of these seem great from a new trader perspective who doesn't want free money and who doesn't want to avoid losses, which if you remember, loss a version is a massive psychological function of all human beings, but traders really face this on a regular basis. This is biological in nature. But anyways, without running too far down that rabbit hole, what's going on here? What do we see in? Well, let's check out a couple of things on Reddit. The first one here says rolling in iron condor. I'm going to skip a couple of lines. And then it says I consider the amount currently showing as a loss in quotations. Then when we look down here, it says I would look for the credit at sell to open to be higher than the loss plus debit to close. I hope you're picking up what I'm putting down here so far.

This person says I know this comes up often, but people always seem to talk about in the point of view of a full time trader essentially saying that there's an opportunity cost, which is accurate. And then it says majority of the people don't have the time skill or patience to do the DD. At least I sure do not. That's hilarious. But then it says for someone that is just looking for a decent trade once in a while. And at least happy with the profit, which is the wrong mindset mind you again, loss a version. That is what you're seeing laced through all of this. Avoid losses. This person can't even say the fucking word loss without quotes around it because that's that subconscious pain. Literally that's going through there. They cannot reconcile some of the actual details of rolling options, which is wild to me.

That's all a role is it is a closing trade that is mentally tied to an opening trade. The reason why I say mentally is because your broker does not track roles. Your broker doesn't give a shit about a role. Position. So when we're talking about rolling options, it literally is just a convenience based concept, meaning what's actually happening is we are closing a trade. We are closing trade one, which was the entry trade two is the exit for trade one. We are out of this position. This position is closed. And we are opening up a brand new one stand alone trade. And what we're doing is linking the accounting to this trade loss a version again. That's the whole purpose of this. It's convenience based, but really the short answer here is what is a role. It's just when we close a trade and we open up a new one very frequently. It's going to be either the same strike option. The same type of option like those kinds of details typically or what carries over. So if you sell a put and then you buy that put back and then you sell another put in the same product, maybe it's a different expiration, maybe it's a different strike, but that's what we're considering",

So let's get into the details now. I know this is the part that nobody really likes. It kind of sucks because we have to put on our thinking cap, but this is actually why the details matter. So let's take a look. We have an example trade one. We sold to open a 10 put at a dollar. Keep in its simple. I'm an idiot. It's easier for me to do math with even numbers. These numbers really aren't super likely. But anyways, so trade one. We sold to open a 10 put collecting a dollar trade to we bought to close that put at two dollars. So for those at home, what's happened so far? What have we done? Well, on this trade one, we collected a credit on trade to we closed our position for a 200 debit. Let's math for Marines here. Let's get through this together. So this is 100 coming in. This is 1200 going out the door. So what's just happened is we realized a 100 loss. We lost 100. I can't put it anymore plainly than that.

I can't put it anymore plainly than that. A lot of people struggle with that. But anyways, let's take a look at what you're seeing here. Avoid losses by rolling options. Okay. Well, by my again, rudimentary math, that's not at all. What's occurred here? Same thing over here with the loss and quotations. These don't look like they're in quotations to me. It looks like that's a realized loss on the books. Now what we're going to talk about is what these people actually mean. What they actually are attempting to convey albeit poorly. So this is exactly what's occurred so far. We simply have lost 100. Okay, fine. That point is now beaten to a dead pulp. Now the role. If you remember, the role occurs between two trade two, trade three. Here's trade two. Here's trade three. Here's our role. So now we sold to open whatever it doesn't matter. We'll just call it the same. The 10 plate. You can roll out. You can roll out and up out and down, meaning when we say out, it means adding days to expiration going out in time. Up or down just means that's where you're moving your strike compared to where you are at. So very frequently, if you sold a put that's bullish, we want",

But it is so important to actually understand what it is and acknowledge the transactions as they're occurring. So I want to help us understand that point just a little bit more. So over here, I have a question for you. Where is the break even premium? So if we sold this option for 3, what does this need to be trading at in order for us to be flat on this series of transactions? If you know the answer, throw it in the comments below. And if you don't, that's cool. I'm going to show you the answer. It's 2. Because what's happened here is we sold to open this option again for 3. We want to make 100 to get back to break even. So if this decreases from three to two, you now have a 100 unrealized game. That brings you to break even on the position. So on this series of trades, if in trade three, this option now is trading at 2, you are at break even. As soon as it falls below",

Now let's do some accounting because this is the part that a lot of people fuck up. We need to understand the difference between net liquidating value and cash and sweep. If you are unsure what those terms mean, simply put net liquidating value is if you flattened your entire account, your entire portfolio. Right now, that's how much is worth fashion sweep is how much cash you have sitting in your account. The part that trips people up is your cash and sweep can be greater than your net lick. Now it's confusing. We're going to get to the bottom of it right now. So let's say you have a 1,000 account. We have trade one here that we sold to open that put for a dollar.

    "text": "over the place. Your net lick is going to be tied to the value of your open positions as they move around. So as you book this loss, we booked a loss. Notice how after you rolled your option, your cash and sweep is up. It's up to 1200. But your net lick is down at 900. This is exactly why you will be unable to roll an option into perpetuity. Okay, which time does rolling avoid losses? Yes or no? It doesn't. What traders like this are attempting to capitalize on is the profit potential down the line. But they're crossing two very important streams of money, unrealized gains and realized gains. So as you follow through that math that we just did together in no way, shape or form, does rolling avoid losses. It realizes the value of the trade. That's exactly what's going on here. Next, can you roll forever? No, you can roll for a really long time. You cannot roll forever. Again, I encourage you go back to that section that we went through the math because what's happening is each time you roll for a loss, your net liquidating value is slowly getting trimmed down because the value of the positions have gone down as you're flattening them. So sooner or later, you might have a giant cash and sweep vehicle ton of money in there, but it's all tied to an open trade that may or may not actually be in profit. And",

And sooner or later, you can become insolvent. Your broker can say, hey, you're not meeting your margin requirements. You can't put that trade on. Now, you have to book the whole thing at a loss. What is expiration liquidity? This is an important concept because a lot of traders, you have to be careful how far out and time you roll. Essentially, expiration liquidity is the idea that the closer you are to expiration, the more options there are available because there's a lot of liquidity in those options. That's where most people are trading. So what that means is if you're trading SPX and you go out zero days, one day, you're going to go out in a day, two day, three day, four day, five day, seven day, ten day. Sooner or later, as you get further out in time, it's going to go from 45 days to 60 days to 70 days. So instead of being in one day increments, the further out in time you go, the greater the days to expiration becomes between the subsequent expiration cycles. This becomes a problem because the idea of rolling for a credit as you fall super far in",

This becomes a problem because the idea of rolling for a credit as you fall super far in the money means you have to go super far out in time. And then all of a sudden, you might have to roll out 180 days in order to get a credit even at the same strike. So it's important to understand that expiration liquidity becomes an important concept when you're rolling options. The last one, this is kind of a trick question. I'll give it to you up front, but we can always roll up or down yes or no. And you always roll up or down yes or no. Yes, you can. There are no rules. So if we go back to the example trade that I gave you, you can absolutely choose to roll this 10 put upper down. You can always roll up or down. It doesn't always make sense. The goal is to try and roll for a credit or break even if you have to, but you can always roll any direction you want. It just might be for a debit and you might be locking in a loss if you're not capturing the math appropriately. So I hope you passed that exam.
