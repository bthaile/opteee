    "text": "When you're trading options, it can be a little difficult to figure out how liquid something is, meaning we're looking at the option and taking the difference between the bid-ass spread. An easy trick to normalize this is if you take the bid-ass spread divided by the strike price and then compare that to the same delta, same expiration and something like spy. Super useful to get a sense of how liquid something is on a relative basis. So give it a shot, let me know if it works, be an outlier, see you all later.",
