So, First thing, grab it up on the platform, move you guys over to the main screen, and let's talk about it. So we know that GameStop had a pretty significant sell-off this day. We looked at this day specifically because it was essentially 10 down move on a day with no news. Like still, essentially no news, which is kind of nuts. Because when companies are making moves like this, I'm speaking in generalities. Sometimes when companies make moves like this, we might not see it the day of, although almost always you do. It's really rare that you'll see a company move 10 plus in a day on no information whatsoever. But on smaller companies, sometimes that can happen, and the information will come out maybe a couple days later, and you could just essentially tell that somebody knew what the hell was going on, and they were playing the move. But that's not even happened here. So bizarre. Now I drew this channel. When did I draw the channel? Definitely before all this. I drew this channel off of these",

When did I draw the channel? Definitely before all this. I drew this channel off of these lines here. I don't think there was any of this in this yet. And it's still running within this really, really steep declining channel. So there's a couple things that stick out to me from this. We've definitely given up this 30 handle. And the reason why that's important is from the way that I'm actually trading it, I took some of the shares down. Some of the actual shares that I'm holding. And I'm setting alerts that as it starts moving its way back up so I can get back into it as the rebound eventually occurs. These two lines have been drawn forever now. I wonder if it tells me like when I actually drew it. Does it tell us? I don't think so. Unless it's from here. Anyways, I don't remember when I drew these, but this definitely would have been over a week ago at least. The reason I'm curious about when I drew them is because the price behavior that you see is helping us identify where we expect the floor to be in GameStop, which is big question right now.

Still hasn't had that significant of a fall. All things considered going from 33 to 27. Now it's a decline, right? That's literally an individual bear market for the stock essentially. However, that being said, it's also a really volatile stock. So really volatile stocks like this will ebb and flow into these kind of moves all the time. So it's not like the same thing is calling it like a bear market in an index ETF, just completely different. That context is only for your general consumption because I know that there was some people that were talking about like, oh, maybe it's setting up like a cup with a cup with handle or something like that. This is too deep of a decline for that again, from a standard technical perspective. Normally, you're going to be sub 10, 15 decline, definitely not 20 plus. So from a general market perspective, we can see that volume really ramped up heavy on this down day. And then it's been on a slow decline. Now we've had some updates, some down days. But the main thing is if you take a look at the volume moving averages, both the five and the 20, they're both negative sloping. So volume is siphoning out ever so slowly,",

So volume is siphoning out ever so slowly, but volume still remains quite elevated compared to where we saw it pre squeeze from May. So there's still definite interest in the stock. We'll take a look through see what institutional ownership and stuff like that looks like and then we'll start looking through if there's any specific news. But from a price action perspective, negative trend. Long term up trend still. So if we zoom this out even to one year daily, you can see that there's still very clearly positive slope in the linear regression. Well, these are standard deviation channels. So that's a really important note that that tells us that this thing is still in an uptrend. Even when I zoom this into a six month timeframe, still an uptrend. So even though on this short term time frame, so if we get this tightened in enough, it will show a downtrend here. So if you come into a one month daily, you can see that it's clearly on a downtrend in the shorter term timeframe, but anything from a three month timeframe out, it's still positive sloping.

Here would have been accumulation, pretty significant accumulation. This is now distribution. So distribution a lot of times will happen when there's steeper consolidations, but this here now is the zone to watch where I have these two alerts that 29 down to the 27. Essentially. Now as I mentioned before, if we start seeing price falling heavy below the 26 and a half, to me, that's short term bearish because this has clearly been defined as a new volume node where lots of people are transacting here. So if it starts getting to the point where it's plummeting below that, well, then that means at least for me, I'm not going to unwind more of my shares from the coverage triangle that I have on in there at this point, but that's when I'm just going to start setting a bunch of alerts for when it does start to base up and out. And then I also will sell more cash secured puts into that because the volatility will be elevated. But volatility right now is at 78 and a half percent, which is a high roast number, but",

And that's again, just pointing out how volatile of stock game stop is, which I think everybody knows that's why we trade it. Now, another thing that we see here is from a oscillator lens RSI down here. I use a two line RSI. I use a moving average and then I use the RSI line itself. And it uses a seven day VWAP for the moving average. And you can see that that's negative sloping. And you can see that the RSI itself is also negative sloping below the moving average, both below 50. That's bearish. That is a complete bearish alignment of that indicator across the board. So all of this is to say from a trading perspective right now, we, for me, not adding longs. I don't add longs in periods like this until it starts to show sustained moves.

There's always a series of indications leading into the move that give you as much time as you possibly can need again from a trader perspective to get back in if you're so inclined. So a lot of the move that we saw here absolutely came from the cap. So we know that he posted, let me grab X and let me find drawing kitty. So the cat posted here and this was on the 22nd. So if we take a look at the stock movement, here's the 21st bit of a down day got caught, which is great. And then 22nd, pretty significant rally up and out also into the 23rd. So this is just another reality. This is absolutely another undeniable reality about the way that roaring kitty can interact and move the stock. He moves the stock. That's all there is to it. Especially in a near term, has he always moved the stock? I don't think so. But we can run a pretty simple analysis of his last X number of posts and see what the average move in GameStop was.

    "text": "near term, has he always moved the stock? I don't think so. But we can run a pretty simple analysis of his last X number of posts and see what the average move in GameStop was. If you guys are interested in doing that, we literally can do it on the stream later. It's super easy to do. But there's a correlation there, which I know, because I already looked at it from a loose perspective. Now, the interesting part is the reversal component to that, which is also tradable, by the way. So one of the things I've noticed is analyzing the correlation between when the cat posts, what the stock does, how long the stock does it, and when does it start to reverse? Because it almost always has a reversal several days after the post within several days after the post. I should say. And just tradable. That's what I'm highlighting is that understanding these kinds of details are really informative because they're tradable. So let's take a look at the options. It looks like we have a few people interested. Yeah, so we can run through the diamond handbook after we've finished the analysis, see how much time that we have left. And if we do, I'm happy to do that with everybody. Richmondson seems like when GME gets all above average, it goes up when lower volume goes down, when vol goes through the roof, it spikes huge in near term. I am unsure. Yeah,",

Richmondson seems like when GME gets all above average, it goes up when lower volume goes down, when vol goes through the roof, it spikes huge in near term. I am unsure. Yeah, I'm unsure. The reason why I say I'm unsure is because I know that that's just an anecdote. I know that that's just what you've happened to have seen, which is okay. But before I like to say stuff like that or before I would say stuff like that personally, I like to actually see it and run an actual analysis because I can see why you might catch that trend. But my guess is there's probably a little bit more to it, but I'm unsure. So I think it's a fair starting point at least. So the option chain is actually pretty damn quiet. So the option chain is at 545,000 calls against 165,000 puts. And we're all over the place. We have aspirations out. This looks like July, let's see, 7 Feb, 17 April, 21 Feb. It's kind of all over the place, 21 Feb. So a lot of them are for the next primary expiration. This looks like. So of this 545K, 94 of it isn't 21 Feb, 119 is in 31 Jan. So this is light.

There's nothing in here that's really interesting me that's standing out is like really impactful or anything like that. The only thing to highlight that is a slight departure from what we've seen the last couple cycles is that the bulk of the OI is for the call side is in the front expiration now 31 Jan, but it's so light, 119,000 super, super light. So yeah, nothing really jumping out at me from from this perspective, volatility's low across the surface. We can see anything stick out to us here. These two stick out 21 March 17 April. I'm assuming earnings is somewhere in that time frame just from the spike from 72 to 82, essentially to 89. My guess is these will ramp up. They typically do in GameStop. It'll go through periods where it's quiet or like this, but it's normally not sustained for significant durations of time. So yeah, I mean, at a really high level from an options lens, not a whole lot that I'm seeing that's leading me to think anything specific is going on. This is about status quo.

So we're seeing a divergence short term timeframe compared to the long. That's normally when we look for capitulation, meaning we try to see where the new defined trend is going to lead. So for me, from a technical lens, all eyes are on the short term side of the analysis window. And I want to see if either it's going to start rotating through and falling below some of those key levels. Or if it's going to consolidate base out, if it bases that's one thing in and of itself, or if it bases and then starts to resume its appreciation from a business perspective from a fundamental perspective, GameStop is in a very weird spot. And I'll explain what I mean by that. So let's grab GameStop here. On bar chart, it's flagged as a buy. That's actually interesting. 64 buy with weakening short term outlook. Yeah, that sounds that's fucking funny because we literally just essentially re-irrated this exact thing. That's hilarious. And let's take a look at some of the fundamentals.

All right, let's take a look at how it's doing in the general landscape. So this is plotting it against other, quote unquote, gaming companies. It's general competitor list. It's going to be a mix of things. It's not really a direct comparison, right? Because pen is similar, but not the same EA. But it gives us an idea of how the industry is doing. So if we take a look within the industry of gaming, we can see RSI, SGHC, and SNAL are the only ones that are above it on a 52-week time frame. That's really important because this means even though GameStop is having a near-term reversal, the fact that it's performing so well within the broader sector and the segment of gaming, that's actually exceedingly telling because it went through the squeeze as we saw. But the really cool thing about this is that the squeeze abated, right? Like this isn't still pricing from the squeeze. What you see here is actual fundamental pricing happening in the stock as compared to what you see here, which is structural factors that are driving changes in the stock price that are generally unnatural.

It's reflective of, again, market factors, people being short and being caught on the wrong side of that, having to buy. It's probably a mix of institutions from a hedge fund, Lens, and then also from market makers, which induces not just a short squeeze, but a bit of a gamma element to it. That's what you see here. This is different. This is actually a fundamental pricing of the company that's changing, which is good. So the fact that it's sustaining this move, post squeeze, and it's sustaining this placement post squeeze is actually really, really good. So all of those things lead me to believe that the company is still generally situated well. The problem it has is it needs to do something. That's just an objective reality. GameStop has to do something. It's in the process of doing some things. We can see that it's closing its weaker performing stores. Really smart.

The reason why the something is so important here is because just because GameStop has money, that's great. It needs to do something with the money to generate revenue. And I continue to reiterate that point because lots of people will continue to say like, oh man, look at all the interests that they can earn on that money. That interest doesn't really matter. It doesn't really matter because people don't right now people don't buy GameStop because it's a bank that earns a yield. That's not the business model. The business model is mixed and we're starting to see it branching out into the card grading services and things like that. But it needs to continue innovating there in order to sustain a fundamental valuation and a fundamental valuation change. That's what it needs. So we're seeing that happening, but it still has a ways to go. Now it has lots of ammunition to use, but it needs to do something. So that is the Cliff Notes version of where GameStop looks like it is right now. And we will now pivot back into the top theories, which is analyzing right now the Diamond Handbook. And book. Let's grab that. I'm going to move this out of the way. And then we'll grab it. So it looks like we're generally in",

I know how to do this. Oh, where are we at? 360. So now we have Lucy Commissar. I am unfamiliar with Lucy. So I'm going to look her up really fast just for my literally just for my general understanding. Lucy, the Thomas are who looks like a journalist. Is that correct? Or is this let me move the chat so I can keep an eye on you guys as I looking through. Is that sound correct to you guys though? Journalist? If not, that's okay. I just don't know if this person is like well known in the community. As you all know, I don't know. But when I look them up, what I see is journalists. So I guess we will figure out. Yeah, okay. So it looks like there's a thing called the Commissar Scoop Reports and Analysis. Oh, whoa. So she has like her own her own thing and it literally talks about a lot of capital-based things.

She was just like, I'm not an option trader. So I'm not sure where my work would overlap. But then I followed up with another email explaining essentially this entire segment that we've been doing. So I'm still optimistic that I'll be able to line up with Susan at some point. But I'm going to grab an email literally right now and see if I can connect with Lucy once we go through her work.

So you still have an offshore account in the US. Yes, you can places like Delaware, Wyoming, they advertise, set up a company. You can't have a bank account that is secret, but you can have a company that is see. Yep. That's correct. And for those that don't know, wealthy people do a lot of stuff with this and it's for a bunch of different reasons. Everybody immediately assumes, you know, it's just to evade taxes and stuff and there are definitely our tax havens in structures like this. I've spent a while working with different kinds of attorneys to learn about all this stuff because it's a world that I didn't understand. And I spent time learning all about this and there's a lot of things you can do that are very crafty to help optimize both your actual financial picture from attacks, optimization standpoint, but then also from a just overall robustness perspective, I guess I would say.

And here it is. Wait, there's two of them. Okay, there's a lot of them. There's one from front line. And then there's one. I'll drop both of them in here. I don't know either of these. I'm just grabbing what I'm seeing. So I can't speak to which one of these is the correct one or if they're the same one, I'm not sure. The first one I dropped is from a YouTube channel called the Wall Street conspiracy movie. The second one is called Money, Power, and Wall Street Part One full documentary from front line PBS.

I'm actually going to add it really quick to a watch list. And then I will work through this personally. And then we will see. So let's add this to watch later. And then hopefully I'll be able to share out what we can find. All right. I suggest everyone go watch it. My opening, absolutely phenomenal. Let me, I'm actually going to see if I can reach out to the people that run this channel. There's a website. Here I'm going to go to the website. Okay. So the domain is gone. Well, damn. I want to put it on. Who bad? Imagine it would be terribly boring for you. This, uh, fuck it. We'll try to do it with audio and see if it works. Yeah. Damn, this is old, man. So you guys can see the post captions. I'm just kind of flipping through it. Naked short selling. Look at this. Oh, it's so. I'm going to see if I can. Are you guys able to read that quick?

So this is talking about the basics of short selling. I imagine most of us are familiar with this. Yeah. Did not know that. That's brand new news to me. I had no idea that it had to do with the tulip market in Holland. But short selling does have a use which I will continue to remind people just in terms of pricing. If if it was actually done correctly, like not this bullshit naked short selling and whatnot like that. That's nonsense. But short selling itself does have a use. Yeah. Yeah.

They're saying that when they looked at all the shares being sold that there were too many shares being sold. Wouldn't it be weird? Wouldn't it be just absolutely bizarre? If somehow there was a way for. A company to have in excess of 100 short interest. Wouldn't that be absolutely insane if that could happen because you would think it's only possible to short what's there. So the idea that maybe there's too many shorts. You know, I don't know, maybe I'm just going off the reservation here, but it almost seems as if it shouldn't be a thing for there to actually be. Access shares being sold short. Don't worry what he's saying is people that are in Wall Street institutions, brokers, market makers, they're all the fucking same humans you are. They're always doing hold and pray, which is never a good vibe. So anytime you feel bad about yourself doing something on the stock market, don't worry.

So let's see if we can do 175. This is the phantom share issue. The funny thing about the phantom share issue. This is what I find so curious about it. If I were a stock holder, long term stock holder, I own the stock. I might vote as a shareholder. What I find so interesting is that there are that many entities that are choosing to vote so much so that you can clearly see that there's an excess over what should be being received in terms of the stock holder.

I understand part of their point right when you're working with really massive systems to have everything line up and zero out is very difficult. I do get that, but I feel like there at least has to be a reasonable level of tolerance. Like at least so what a fucking response. If I have a chance to talk with Susan, I want to show her this clip.

Reffko to start selling Sedona stock short from an account at an offshore refco affiliate Jesus. So, refco is not a fly by night had four billion and 200,000 customer accounts largest broker on the CME in a month they push the price of shares down from six to one.

The fact nothing was happening tells you again the alignment of the incentive structure. Weird. Because every dollar that you sell is a dollar in my pocket price fell 75 cents and it fell fell to 10 cents. Lauren says why people are so passionate about GameStop. I I agree with you to a degree. The reason why I say that is because I think a lot of people in GameStop. And again, this is my just general observation. I think a lot of people in GameStop have a very casual relationship with it. And if we were to ask the majority of people that are involved in the stock, like if they could describe these elements, I'm I'm dubious that they could.

But the reason why I say that is because with how long this thing has been going on for a lot of things could have been done if people cared about it from the perspective of I care about markets being fair. And I say that because what Dave Lauer is doing with Dave Lauer is doing by filing that lawsuit that's a lot of work, but that's also putting his money where his mouth is that's not cheap, a fund.

Physical protests don't work. I mean, I guess that there's a lot to that. I think your ability to protest however you want. I think it's fair. So you doing it that way. I think it's okay. And I think to try to figure out what you want the impact of your action to be is also really, really important. But I think when we say like they're shutting the truckers down and freezing bank accounts, that part I'm not positive what that's in reference to more broadly.

It's just another dangerous thing that we do when we're upset about something when we don't like something we generalize it really, really broadly versus keeping it very specific to who the entities are. So yeah, just a couple thoughts on that. But let's see. Of the baddies, they've been doing it a month represented 40 of all trades. Somebody should have been looking to start trying to figure out what's going on conversion. Lefse don't is still out of 2.5 million loans. Oh, one point nine. They would have to issue more shares because they would end up letting baddies control the company. So in the start of February, they had 77 employees, 65 clients that wanted the software IBM contract, 7 million financing. When the stock tanked, they lost business couldn't get other financing and had a fire. So Sedona finally went to the SEC justice department. They were looking what's going on. They charged Andreas in a criminal case, but he jumped. He jumped sale and went to Vienna. Austria doesn't have treaty with the US that where somebody is miscreant and a financial crime. You can't demand that person. So there's no extra edition. Yeah. Okay. More moved by them. So Thomas baddie and on Rhino have settled with the SEC for 1 million without admitting guilt, but",

And specifically regarding this individual ticker. My comment was more so that I think it's tied mostly to the individuals and their individual financial relationship with that ticker. I think that's a good perspective of because of my interaction with this ticker. I now can clearly see that there are clear elements of manipulation in the broader market. And I want to do something about that for the broader market and broader market fairness. And I think if we came to that second conclusion. Then even though individuals might not know where to start.

Seed and co is where most traders I talk to have never heard of anything like it. And that they don't actually hold shares only beneficials. Yeah. So I think TCM you're comparing another element that I fully agree with. Because when we look at GameStop, GameStop or the people that remain really close to the story. Absolutely. We'll know more about all of these different kind of inner workings. It's one of the reasons why I'm so fascinated because it's helping me learn more about a lot of these inner working.

We have now a GameStop maybe Cohen can do the wedding or something. But we literally have a GameStop love affair that we all get to be a part of and support.

It just means that justice might be delayed because the reality is is that if they ever want to try to go through the US or any other entity like associated with us in any significant way. They're running a risk. So one of the things to keep in mind, although it's not pure justice and it's not ideal, but it is something at least to be aware of is that for these people when they flee to somewhere like Austria, you can still live a life you can be fine. You can't be terrible, but you do have a target on your back and if you're trying to go somewhere through the US at any point, you essentially can't.

I wasn't really around back then, but I do think that there was a point in time. Maybe maybe it's just us church and it up and you know thinking about a better time that maybe didn't exist. But I thought that there was a period in time where like journalistic integrity was actually like a really, really important thing and was much more widely consumed. So this is just interesting. It just can't imagine anybody actually thinks that today. Okay, video. Jim Kramer. Good old Jimmy Kramer. Do you believe major media outlets have been compromised? We know that. I don't think that's much of a. Do you believe it's possible that large institutions compensate media outlets? Of course. Here's another thing for those that don't know and I'm not looking to go too far down like the tin foil rabbit hole and all that kind of stuff. But if you look at who are some of the largest purchasers and sponsors of media. So are the largest corporate. What are the big sponsors of news and media? Let's see.

Yeah, so it's just talking about something that's built up over time. The only thing I can recommend from this perspective is to try and look at stuff from multiple sources and not multiple of the same sources. I actually try to look at stuff from what I would consider to be opposing sources. So if there's a piece of news that I'm trying to read, I'll literally look for the article on CNN and then I will look for the article on something like Fox. And I will look at both of their slants on it. The good part about both of their slants is that we know their slants, right? It's not like any subtext that you have to pick up. It's going to be like abundantly clear the disposition as you're writing it. But I continually try to find really, really objective sources of news. And I struggle with it so hard.

This DD library that we're going through in this specific segment of the library, the Diamond Handbook is literally the perfect depiction of that. There is some exceedingly, exceedingly intelligent analysis occurring here. Couldn't, literally couldn't agree more. Okay. We like, we like Keith, that's good. You said the same share could be located dozens of times. Yep, the option market makers like Citadel were exempt from the rules. Yep, yep. So this is good. Okay. Overstock. You'll plaintiff, fake plaintiff. Shill is a real word then. Yes, that's so funny. Two lawyers from these went to prison. Why did they not look for the other part of the scheme, which is a question. Overstock filed suit against 11 prime brokers. 11 of them. It pursued strategy conversion for market makers. Yeah. Conversions were bought by prime brokers, acquire and vent long stocks that they could loan out. I think the security is lending market. It's just like the mob completely rigged, completely agree. I'm trying to get to the TLDR for this one. Am. All right. I got to add our leave off point here. Man, this was a really interesting session. Leave off point for 25 Jan. We need to watch some of the Wall Street conspiracy movie. I'm going to add the link to that in here so that we have it all in one spot. We need",

I'm going to add the link to that in here so that we have it all in one spot. We need to start from around 26 minutes. Anything you guys want to take a look at before we wrap up? Any questions you guys have from a broader perspective? I haven't really taken time to do like any sort of broader questions and what not, which I apologize for. That's why I'm ending a few minutes early before dinner gets here so that if people have questions, we have a chance to talk about it together. But if not totally cool as well, Nathan says so far, we can look at that kind of thing on Monday. I prefer to keep it specific to GameStop for this one. The purpose of having specific themes for the streams and whatnot is so that we can stay like zoomed in, honed in on stuff. And then streams like the Monday, Wednesday stream, those are good for kind of taking a look at whatever. PCM says check Reddit link on Discord. Awesome. Thank you. I will take a look through that. Just let me know where it is. Cool. All right, okay. Well, then that wraps me up. If you guys need anything, you always can drop me a line, shoot me an email.",

Thanks for being a part of the journey with me. I cannot tell you how much I'm enjoying learning all about this. I think this is probably one of the most interesting stories I've come across from a bunch of different reasons, but this specific segment of going deeper and all of the analysis behind GameStop, the company, the market. This has been one of the coolest parts for me because I am a market junkie. Like I said, I've been obsessed with this stuff since I've been a teenager. So being able to go insanely deep on this and understand the market's more in depth is so cool to me. And I'm thankful to be able to do that all with you and hopefully show you all some of that as well. So being outlier, I'll see you all later.",
