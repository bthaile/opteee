    "text": "you you you you you you this so far that I can clearly identify it's taught me a ton about how markets behave, the way things seem to be versus the way that they are. And yeah, super, super interesting to me. So the game plan for this session today is pretty standard fair. We'll start with a quick overview. Just analyze where GameStop is today. Any new news that's coming out, those kinds of things and then we'll dive into the next iteration of the top theory analysis where we're going through the DD library. I think we're almost through the second half of the Diamond Handbook, I believe it's called the Diamond Handbook, which is over 400 pages. So we've consumed an incredible amount of information, different theories and stuff, which is super fun for me. It's interesting to see the way that people think. And again, for those that don't understand my interest and application for this, I imagine most of you are, but for anybody that's tuning in for the first time, like I'm still primarily a trader. It's how I make my money. It's what I do. So GameStop is interesting from a lot of general market function perspectives for me. And understanding the way that people think about it, the way that people use it, the way that people treat it is very interesting to me. And it's just a lot of it is so different than what I do. So I really enjoy",

And it's just a lot of it is so different than what I do. So I really enjoy that perspective. And then also there's the reality that I trade GameStop and I trade GameStop for a reason. And it's because there's a lot of volatility. Now I still fully consider myself a guest in the GameStop house because I was not there the entire duration. Like I know some people have been in the stock for four years now, five years now. And I just kind of come in trade, leave when it's time to move on to something else. So taking time to get into detail on it has been super fun. Now one quick admin note is you'll notice that on Tuesdays, I'm starting to get into a regular cadence of a GameStop specific video coming out on Tuesdays. And the reason I'm hammering that in is because while there's not always a lot going on with GameStop, meaning the cat doesn't always post or the stock isn't always flying all over the place. So that means that it kind of has slowed down the number of GameStop videos that I've been doing is standalone videos because it's been a little more quiet. But I realize even though I am still looking at it every day,",

But I realize even though I am still looking at it every day, I'm not sure that people are able to like track what I'm tracking specifically from an options and derivatives perspective. So that's the goal of that Tuesday video. And the other thing that you'll note is on that video, I'll walk through the position that I've been sharing with you all. I'm using a model position really breaking out part of my broader position and then showing everybody how we can trade GameStop specifically using options. And it's just the way that I'm doing it in what I consider to be probably one of the more applicable ways for most people that trade GameStop from the perspective of most that I know really want to buy it, want to hold it. So we want to base the options trading around the equity position, which we can absolutely do. That's the cool part about options. So who do we got in the chat? We got Lucas Lauren Reese.

So I'll take a pause as we're like changing key topics just so that it's easy to navigate going back in time for everybody. So a 20 into the stream and we were doing GME stock analysis. Let's see what the dealio is. First thing, grab it up on the platform. Move you guys over to the main screen. And let's talk about it. So we know that GME stock had a pretty significant sell off this day. We looked at this day specifically because it was essentially 10 down move on a day with no news. Like still essentially no news, which is kind of nuts. Sometimes when companies are making moves like this, speaking in generalities, sometimes",

It's really rare that you'll see a company move 10 plus in a day on no information whatsoever. But on smaller companies, sometimes that can happen and the information will come out maybe a couple days later and you could just essentially tell that somebody knew what the hell was going on and they were playing the move. But that's not even happened here. So bizarre. Now I drew this channel. When did I draw the channel? Definitely before all this. I drew this channel off of these lines here. I don't think there was any of this in this yet. And it's still running within this really, really steep declining channel. So there's a couple things that stick out to me from this. We've definitely given up this 30 handle. And the reason why that's important is from the way that I'm actually trading it. I took some of the shares down. Some of the actual shares that I'm holding. And I'm setting alerts that as it starts moving its way back up so I can get back into it",

I wonder if it tells me like when I actually drew it. Does it tell us? I don't think so. Unless it's from here. Anyways, I don't remember when I drew these, but this definitely would have been over a week ago at least. And the reason why I'm curious about when I drew them is because the price behavior that you see is helping us identify where we expect the floor to be in GameStop, which is big question right now. Still hasn't had that significant of a fall. All things considered going from 33 to 27. Now it's a decline, right? That's literally individual bear market for the stock essentially. However, that being said, it's also a really volatile stock. So really volatile stocks like this will ebb and flow into these kind of moves all the time. So it's not like the same thing is calling it like a bear market in an index ETF. Just completely different.

And it just, this is too deep of a decline for that again, from a standard technical perspective. Normally, you're going to be sub 10, 15 decline, definitely not 20 plus. So from a general market perspective, we can see that volume really ramped up heavy on this down day. And then it's been on a slow decline. Now we've had some updates, some down days. But the main thing is if you take a look at the volume moving averages, both the five and the 20, they're both negative sloping. So volume is siphoning out ever so slowly. But volume still remains quite elevated compared to where we saw it pre squeeze from may. So there's still definite interest in the stock. We'll take a look through, see what institutional ownership and stuff like that looks like. And then we'll start looking through if there's any specific news. But from a price action perspective, negative trend long term uptrend still.

So that's a really important note that that tells us that this thing is still in an uptrend. Even when I zoom this into a six month time frame still in uptrend. So even though on this short term time frame, so if we get this Titan in a knob, it will show a downtrend here. So if we come into a one month daily, you can see that it's clearly on a downtrend in the shorter term time frame. But anything from a three month time frame out, it's still positive sloping. So still very much in general accumulation. The way that we would describe this from a standard stage style technical analysis lens, right stage one through four, this here would have been accumulation, pretty significant accumulation. This is now distribution. So distribution a lot of times will happen when there's steeper consolidations. But this here now is the zone to watch where I have these two alerts that 29 down to the 27 essentially.

So if it starts getting to the point where it's plummeting below that, well, then that means at least for me, I'm not going to unwind more of my shares from the coverage strangle that I have on in there at this point. But that's when I'm just going to start setting a bunch of alerts for when it does start to base up and out. And then I also will sell more cash secured puts into that because the volatility will be elevated. Valtzility right now is at 78.5, which is a high roast number. But as a relative basis, implied volatility percentiles literally 8 super, super light. And that's again, just pointing out how volatile of stock game stop is, which I think everybody knows that's why we trade it. Now, another thing that we see here is from a oscillator lens RSI down here. I use a two line RSI. I use a moving average and then I use the RSI line itself. And it uses a seven day V-wap for the moving average. And you can see that that's negative sloping. And you",

That is a complete bearish alignment of that indicator across the board. So all of this is to say from a trading perspective, right now we, for me, not adding longs. I don't add longs in periods like this until it starts to show sustained moves. And again, something I try to remind everybody of as much as I can is that when game stop starts to have really big massive moves, we tend to get a little bit of a heads up. It doesn't happen overnight. It's never next day. There's always a series of indications leading into the move that give you as much time as you possibly can need, again, from a trader perspective to get back in if you're so inclined. So a lot of the move that we saw here absolutely came from the cap. So we know that he posted, let me grab X and let me find for him kitty. So the cat hosted here. And this was on the 22nd.

So this is just another reality. This is absolutely another undeniable reality about the way that roaring kitty can interact and move the stock. He moves the stock. That's all there is to it, especially in a near term. Has he always moved the stock? I don't think so. But we can run a pretty simple analysis of his last X number of posts and see what the average move in GameStop was. If you guys are interested in doing that, we literally can do it on the stream later. It's super easy to do. But there's a correlation there, which I know, because I already looked at it from a loose perspective. Now the interesting part is the reversal component to that, which is also tradable, by the way. So one of the things I've noticed is analyzing the correlation between when the cat posts, what the stock does, how long the stock does it, and when does it start to reverse?

It looks like we have a few people interested. Yeah, so we can run through the diamond handbook after we've finished the analysis, see how much time that we have left. And if we do, I'm happy happy to do that with everybody. Richmondson seems like when GME gets all above average, it goes up, when lower volume goes down, when vol goes through the roof, it spikes huge in near term. I am unsure. Yeah, I'm unsure. The reason why I say I'm unsure is because I know that that's just an anecdote. I know that that's just what you've happened to have seen, which is okay. But before I like to say stuff like that or before I would say stuff like that personally, I like to actually see it and run an actual analysis because I can see why you might catch that trend.

So the options chain is at 545,000 calls against 165,000 puts. And we're all over the place. We have explorations out. This looks like July. Let's see. 7 Feb, 17 April, 21 Feb. It's kind of all over the place. 21 Feb. So a lot of them are for the next primary expiration. This looks like. So of this 545K, 94 of it isn't 21 Feb. 119 is in 31 Jan. So this is light. There's nothing in here that's really interesting. Me that's standing out is like really impactful or anything like that. The only thing to highlight that is a slight departure from what we've seen the last couple cycles is that the bulk of the OI is for the call side is in the front expiration now 31 Jan, but it's so light. 119,000 super, super light. So yeah, nothing really jumping out at me from from this perspective, volatility is low across the surface. We can see anything stick out to us here. These two stick out 21 March 17 April.

We can see anything stick out to us here. These two stick out 21 March 17 April. I'm assuming earnings is somewhere in that time frame just from the spike from 72 to 82 essentially to 89. My guess is these will ramp up. They typically do in GameStop. It'll go through periods where it's quiet or like this, but it's normally not sustained for significant durations of time. So yeah, I mean, at a really high level from an options lens, not a whole lot that I'm seeing that's leading me to think anything specific is going on. This is about status quo. The volatility contracting as much as it has that is marginally interesting just because volatility tends to carry a bit higher in GameStop. And from a technical perspective, long term uptrend defined as three month timeframe plus, but short term downtrend as defined one month and within. So we're seeing a divergence short term timeframe compared to the long that's normally when we look for capitulation, meaning we try to see where the new defined trend is going to lead. So for me, from a technical lens, all eyes are on the short term side of the analysis window. And I want to see if either it's going to start rotating through and falling below some of those key levels or",

From a business perspective, from a fundamental perspective, GameStop is in a very weird spot. And I'll explain what I mean by that. So let's grab GameStop here. On bar chart, it's flagged as a buy. That's actually interesting. 64 buy with weakening short term outlook. Yeah, that sounds, that's fucking funny because we literally just essentially re-irrated this exact thing. That's hilarious. And let's take a look at some of the fundamentals. I want to specifically look at it under the hood. I don't care so much. All right, let's. Nothing jumping out at me here, like crazy. Let's take a look at how it's doing in the general landscape. So this is plotting it against other, quote-unquote, gaming companies. It's general competitor list. It's going to be a mix of things. It's not really a direct comparison, right? Because pen is similar, but not the same EA. But it gives us an idea of how the industry is doing. So if we take a look within the industry of gaming,",

But it gives us an idea of how the industry is doing. So if we take a look within the industry of gaming, we can see RSI, SGHC, and SNAL are the only ones that are above it on a 52 week timeframe. That's really important because this means even though GameStop is having a near-term reversal, the fact that it's performing so well within the broader sector and the segment of gaming, that's actually exceedingly telling because it went through the squeeze as we saw. But the really cool thing about this is that the squeeze abated, right? Like this isn't still pricing from the squeeze. What you see here is actual fundamental pricing happening in the stock as compared to what you see here, which is structural factors that are driving changes in the stock price that are generally unnatural. A natural meaning it's not reflective of the fundamental value of the company. It's reflective of, again, market factors, people being short and being caught on the wrong side of that having to buy. It's probably a mix of institutions from a hedge fund lens and then also from market makers which induces not just a short squeeze but a bit of a gamma element to it. That's what you see here. This is different. This is actually a fundamental pricing",

So the fact that it's sustaining this move post squeeze and it's sustaining this placement post squeeze is actually really, really good. So all of those things lead me to believe that the company is still generally situated well. The problem it has is it needs to do something. Like that's just an objective reality. GameStop has to do something. And it's in the process of doing some things, right? We can see that it's closing its weaker performing stores. Really smart. And it essentially needs to continue down that path of doing something. The reason why the something is so important here is because just because GameStop has money. That's great. It needs to do something with the money to generate revenue. And I continue to reiterate that point because lots of people will continue to say like, Oh man, look at all the interest that they can earn on that money. That interest doesn't really matter. It doesn't really matter because people don't right now people don't buy GameStop because it's a bank that earns a yield. That's not the business model. The business model is mixed.

But it needs to continue innovating there in order to sustain a fundamental valuation and a fundamental valuation change. That's what it needs. So we're seeing that happening. But it still has a ways to go. Now it has lots of ammunition to use. But it needs to do something. So that is the Cliff Notes version of where GameStop looks like it is right now. And we will now pivot back into the top theories, which is analyzing right now the diamond handbook. And book. Let's grab that. I'm going to move this out of the way. And then we'll grab it. So it looks like we're generally in kind of like a series of AMAs. And this one, let's grab where we left off. I know how to do this. I know how to do this. Where are we at? 360.

That's brand new news to me. I had no idea that it had to do with the tulip market in Holland. But short selling does have a use, which I will continue to remind people just in terms of pricing. If if it was actually done correctly, like not this bullshit, naked short selling and whatnot, like that, that's nonsense. But short selling itself does have a use. Yeah. Yeah. Which this reflects exactly what we were talking about last week during the last episode of this where during the shareholder meetings, we were finding that there were so many extra voters people thinking that they had a vote. And it's because of it's literally because of this. So this it's all all just connecting those dots. Yeah. Fucking sound familiar. They're saying that when they looked at all the shares being sold that there were too many shares being sold. Wouldn't it be weird? Wouldn't it be just absolutely bizarre? If somehow there was a way for a company to have in excess of 100 short interest, wouldn't that be absolutely insane if that could happen because you would think it's only possible to short what's there?

So anytime you feel bad about yourself doing something on the stock market, don't worry, there's people with glasses that are brokers doing the same shit. Huh, that's kind of selfish.

When we're trying to piece together the truth, the reality, how things actually are. One of the elements that's really important is objective analysis. But part of that objective analysis is seeing how many things tend to line up. This is now the unearthed version of this exact thing that we've heard from a bunch of different sources from a bunch of different vectors. That tells me something important. That tells me there's something behind what the fuck they're talking about. This is the phantom share issue. The funny thing about the phantom share issue. This is what I find so curious about it. If I were a stockholder, long term stockholder, I own the stock, I might vote as a shareholder. What I find so interesting is that there are that many entities that are choosing to vote so much so that you can clearly see that there's an excess over what should be being received in terms of votes.

Just don't write anything or if you're gonna write something write something that's decent So I think that we all know that that kind of thing is Um like pretty profound at this In addition, how can regular consumer differentiate between trusted sources and compromise outlets? Fuck that's a I don't think the way Yeah, so it's just talking about something that's built up over time The only thing I can recommend from this perspective Is to try and look at stuff from multiple sources and not multiple of the same sources I actually try to look at stuff from what I would consider to be opposing sources So if there's a piece of news that I'm trying to read I'll literally look for the article on CNN and then I will look for the article on something like Fox And I will look at both of their slants on it The",

It's gonna be like abundantly clear the disposition as you're writing it But I continually try to find really really objective sources of news and I struggle with it so hard believe it or not. That's actually one of my absolute favorite reasons Why I like I like finance so much because finance really does a good job at Getting rid of all of the excess bullshit around stuff and there's also another thing that I'll tell you guys about that I do like it's called It's loading right now hold on It's called ground news I don't know if you guys are familiar with ground news But I like that a lot too ground news is pretty decent and The the thing about ground news is it kind of just shows a little bit of different perspectives which I like and it kind of Helps make it a little more clear what the perspectives are so Yeah overall I think it's a bit challenging though to find And Actually good objective information, but",

Oh, I like this one I agree with your distrust and because of what I haven't watched television 20 30 years I don't have a working TV. This is funny. I do it. I do have a working TV But I don't watch TV either literally zero So I identify much with Lucy here And when there are hearings go to the website committee So I would not trust any of these places.
