    "text": "We have a gift from the Volga today the Seabull launched the one day VIX and for those that don't know the VIX VIX typically looks out 30 days. So I want to talk to you about this product, what it is, how it works, and then how you can use it. What's up, everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers. Shout out to the Patreon family. Thank you guys so much for the love. I cannot tell you how awesome it is. Why do we need or why do we now have a one day volatility index and it's because of demand. And I'm going to show you a chart in just a second that shows you the disposition of zero DTE SPX utilization by traders and it's massive. But this is what we have now. This is kind of like this standard, which is VIX. And as I mentioned, this is a 30 day future volatility of SPX. Now it's important to note that because it looks out 30 days, it loses a lot of sensitivity in super short term time frames. So there's two things that coalesce here. We have a gap for that kind of product and we have a dramatic rise in the use of short term options. I want you to take a look. This is from Goldman Sachs and this is from March or April. And I want to show you guys actually of this year. I lied to you because",

And I want to show you guys actually of this year. I lied to you because this shows us Q123. So yeah, this is super recent. And as you look at this dark blue, this is less than 24 hours of SPX volume. Notice what it was back in 2011. It was what like two, three percent, something like that. Notice word is now. And this is all kind of kicked off post COVID when we first had COVID back here. You can see a dramatic increase. And then it's just been parabolic since whereas now it's literally over 40 of SPX volume. And this is a huge amount of time frame. So there's a giant demand for short term offerings here, but we don't have anything at least before today that gave us an intraday view to align with this increased demand. So let's talk about how it works. It's a non-tradable product. It's just like the VIX one year for those that have seen it. So here today is the 24th of the year. We're going to talk about the quality of how this moved because everybody's baffled with what happened today and how it behaved. But that is a little bit later. I want to show you the product itself.

But that is a little bit later. I want to show you the product itself. So if we go over here to trade, notice it has no options. It has no bid, no ask. So this is merely a calculation. And I'll show you the computation in a second. And for those that don't know because a lot of people think that VIX one year is the same exact thing, but it just goes out for a you guessed it full year. So if you go in here to trade, no bid, no ask, no options. Same exact thing. It's not a tradable product. It is literally just something for us to observe and to use as a tool. Now does this mean that the VIX one day would never be tradable? Maybe, maybe not. Who knows? They could make it a tradable product. But based on the press released from the sea, both and in the last video. So with the next look, I'll show you a couple of things. I want to go first. And I want to show you a couple of things.

That But nonetheless, this is what I think you guys should definitely take a look at. And this is from the Seabull. Like I said, I'll throw a link to this. But if you go down here to the bottom, you can see where it says the index methodology paper, which is very well written. And it walks you through exactly how this thing works. So and it walks you through in steps. So I'm not going to go through all of this in detail because you have access to it. If you have any questions on it, make sure you let me know. But the cool part about this product and the way that we can use it is it gives you much better fidelity on short term volatility. And it's because today we had nothing that really told us in today unless you calculated it yourself, what you can. But now for most people that don't want to do that, you have something that is going to give you the calculation by itself. So if we take a look",

But now for most people that don't want to do that, you have something that is going to give you the calculation by itself. So if we take a look at the VIX one day by itself, we can start to chart and create relationships. This is one of the first ways I would use it between the VIX one day and SPX, the biggest products in the SPX so that you can understand when this thing moves, how other things move. Because what I will tell you is the market movement that we saw today was a little bit tricky compared to what the VIX one day showed us. And what I mean by that is if I pull up SPX and let's zoom in from this to let's do it today one minute. So you can see the intraday volatility here. The percentage move today was 0.6. The five day daily range is 0.68. And then the 30 day average true range is smaller than that. That calculation is wrong. I have to check the formula here. Don't look at that. But this is correct. The five day average daily range. So as we look at the way it moved today, we had an open at 4132, high of 41 42, a low of 4117. So this was a pretty inside day. There wasn't anything remarkable about this,",

So this was a pretty inside day. There wasn't anything remarkable about this, especially if we look back over a longer time frame. Where we can see definitely some larger movements, intraday going back, you know, the last three days. So the reason why this is important is because this tells me that the VIX one day, the computation, the way it's getting the data, it's still kind of figuring itself out. And I think that's an important note. I wouldn't use this for any sort of significant trading decisions just yet until we understand how it behaves, how the market behaves around it, what it correlates to, how strong those correlations are. One of the things that I think pretty much all traders need to consider is how something works before you trade it. You can figure it out pretty quick, but today, parts from what most of us would have expected this thing to do. So that is an important note because most of us obviously need to observe a little bit more on how this product is going to behave longer term. So the little too early, we're an information gathering mode, but what I would ultra highly recommend is take a look at how this behaves over the set",

And then take a look at the SPX definitely maybe one of the other indices like the Russell, but then pick a handful of individual stocks from within the SP 500. And then you can start creating pairs correlations between them, which can be a really interesting trade idea. So too early right now, but something for the back pocket, if you have any questions on it, let me know all those links in the notes below, be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.",
