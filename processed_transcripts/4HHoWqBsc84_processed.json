    "text": "Just quick market update. I got three things on the agenda as you can tell. It's a little bit dark. I'm on the mobile setup. I'm actually hanging out right by Central Park getting ready to fly back to San Diego, but wanted to wrap the week up with you all because it was a little bit going on. And I did a video after the Fed rate release on Wednesday, which is pretty interesting. And today we got some new data. So I want to talk about the market as a whole. And then I want to talk about Tesla, GameStop and Novo. Those would be the main tickers we're going to dive into. So first things first, from a broad market perspective, it looks like we're still in this rotation phase I've talked about. We can see broader breadth indicators like net highs lows for cues for New York Stock Exchange, still rolling over even expanding still to the downside. Advanced decline cumulative average, negative sloping on a 50 period moving average. And just starting to take up a little bit, VIX is down some that may note here is it's just rotation. Like we're seeing names rebounding a little bit. This is actually one of the best possible times to go through and see which names are not participating within the sector level rebounds because it can help you find short ideas, things that are showing weakness. The other thing you can look for are things that",

This is actually one of the best possible times to go through and see which names are not participating within the sector level rebounds because it can help you find short ideas, things that are showing weakness. The other thing you can look for are things that didn't rebound quite as much as others. So you can see that in effect across the board, there is stuff like XLK had a really strong rally today. There's other names that didn't quite rally as much like XLE energy still showing weakness. So lots of interesting ideas out there as per usual. But yeah, I think I want to spend a little more time just talking about what the market is seeing writ large. So we can see today that the market had a bit of an emotional roller coaster and PCE, which is a really big inflation gauge for the Fed. It's actually a little bit light and we can see that it's 2.4 on annual basis compared to 2.5. That was massive. And this is essentially what fueled most of the rally today because we saw the Fed not all that long ago once they saying that they're probably going to roll out rate cuts a little slower. And the market doesn't like that because the market is looking for instant gratification, kind of like a kid looking for a sugar high. And they want all the good stuff right now. The problem obviously with doing something",

The problem obviously with doing something like that is it but it's a lot of issues further down the line. So we can see PCE really came in a little bit light. I mean, it's still unabashedly elevated. But it's getting closer and closer to some of the Fed target rates, which I think is quite telling. But I think it reinforces some of the Fed's point that they are probably going to approach future cuts a little more cautiously. And we looked at the probability for a cut. Actually, let's do that really quick because we didn't do this on the livestream tonight after PCE came out. And I'm actually curious what this is. So let's give it to this. Yeah. So still overwhelming probability of no change on 29 Jan and very little change over yesterday. But then out to a week ago, it's up massively from a 78 chance. So we have to keep an eye on this. So yeah, the market itself is still hyper hyper sensitive to inflation as we expect. So I think the name of the game here is position smartly. I'm finding a lot of opportunity with individual names that have been bucking this overall trend for upside",

And then I've already talked about the main thesis to the downside and stuff like energy just because it's been there's nothing shocking about that. It's an easy, easy find. So let's now pivot to a few of the tickers that we want to talk about. Actually, I'm sorry, one thing before that. I want to show you this. So the advanced decline is actually showing a little bit of strength today. New York Stock Exchange had 74 advancing NASDAQ had 63. But take a look at the highs and lows. We had 19 52 week highs on NIC 37 on NASDAQ. And then 139 52 week lows against 196 52 week lows. So even though stuff rebounded today had an advancing day, the overall tenor is still weakness. So the market is going to have to gain a footing before I would start adding a bunch of risk as mentioned to you all before on when's the actually paired down a lot of risk in things like the coverage strangle leverage ETFs and whatnot. It's it's really not necessarily knowing that this is going to happen. You never know when it's going to happen, but it's an evaluative,",

So let's pivot over now and let's take a look at a few names because one of them that stuck out to me was Tesla because Tesla has been on an absolute tear yet we can clearly see Tesla is slowing down a little bit and this looks more in terms of participation with the broader market. But notice how Tesla did not rally today and the rest of the market did that to me indicates that this is starting to get to an extreme level that people are starting to say like, okay, I think this is ran up quite a lot, take some profit here, get some money off the table. So I think Tesla really needs to consolidate some before unless it has new news. If it has new news, it's a different story, but either new news or probably consolidation will look to be on the docket here. And let's take a look at the options chain here. We can see it's 4.5 million calls against 4.7 on the put side. There's 2 million calls traded today, 1.7 million puts.",

This might be people cashing in on puts that they've bought near highs or this could be people that are starting to think that we could be getting near a value area selling puts to try to take on assignment if they're assigned or just collecting the credit on the down move because volatility will kick up a little bit. Lots of potentials there. And then a call side looks mostly like closures, at least definitively. The most typically will transact between the market, which we can't definitively tell if it was bought or sold. So let's take a quick look just at the overall volume today, the expiration's yeah, super short term. So the most of the volume today was for 20 days and that's likely people collecting whatever value they can out of those options before rolling them out. So no big surprise there. Let's take a quick look at Novo. And this is interesting because this has to do with their weight loss drug.

Let me pause this real quick and see if I can get this thing to load. Which is dumb and had it an extra oh and they're back. So you can see Novo here at drop down from one and four to 81. And this has everything to do with this trial information. So you can see here I've read through this yet. Let me see. Here goes for more than a year is told the world that expects patients to lose at least 25 of their body weight. Okay, so 25 sorry, not 30 on experimental drug Kagrasima. It turns out the company was wrong on Friday. They released results of a phase three trial. Patients only lost 22.7 which seems actually pretty close of their body weight on average after about a year and a half. There's some wrinkles in the data that suggest a drug could be better than it looks. They still plan to ask regulators to approve the medicine, but that 22.7 rate is about the same efficacy as Z bound the Eli Lily, which is the main thing here because if we take",

I don't I would have expected them maybe to rally a little bit more, but they had other stuff going on themselves. So interesting movements between these the drift potential specifically for NVO for Novo is not insignificant. So I try to keep a pretty close eye on the options chain for stuff like this because a lot of people will know these results before they come out. And the other thing is the again, the ability for these results to drift forward now for at least some time or not insignificant. So you can see in the 17 Jan, there's 76,000 calls against 85,000 puts. So there's probably some people playing a little bit of drift, which is I think pretty smart. The little early because it also has earnings coming up, but the trade to the downside on that news is decent. I see what's going on there. And then last thing we have to take a look at is GameStop.

    "text": "because it also has earnings coming up, but the trade to the downside on that news is decent. I see what's going on there. And then last thing we have to take a look at is GameStop. And it's because we have an expiration today, the stock closed at 2982, which is pretty solid. Max Payne did move. And as always, it's I served that as a reminder because a lot of people, the emphasis on Max Payne sometimes can be a little bit excessive, I think. And sometimes we can forget that like the stock can also move on its own for for people wanting to get in and out. Now again, last Friday, I think it's a slightly different case because the probability of that being attributed to a couple of other things is pretty high. But this looks like normal stock movement. And the fact that this stock is hovering up like this is huge. If you take a look at the rally, 2.83 on the day, which is really, really solid, this, it just looks good, right? We're seeing higher lows slow ascent, which I like to see implied volatility is pretty high. So implied volatility is 117 and volatility percentile 61. So pretty high on a relative basis. Now, if we poke through the options chain, 872,000 calls against 299 on the put side. So call skew is expanding pretty massively. So this is almost at three times calls to puts. That starts to get",

So call skew is expanding pretty massively. So this is almost at three times calls to puts. That starts to get interesting to me. This very frequently will hover one and a half to two and a quarter times calls to puts. But three starts to be in anomaly specifically for GameStop. And we can see there's a ton of calls that were bought today and a lot of puts that were sold today. So if we break down the volume for today, we can see that the overall bulk, probably what the 30s here. And that's, you see, 30s. And that's because they were going to be out of the money. So that's probably a ton of people that were grabbing what they could out of them. And then rolling them out in time. But let's take a look at the next expiration cycle 67 to 12. So really big skew, but small numbers overall. 3j is super quiet. 10j and very quiet with 17j. 17j is 37 again, 6. That's massive as well. So the volume is definitely centering again in these run expiration with 2070s, taking up a little bit more than expected. And if we take a look at the volatility surface, let's take a look at 17j and like fab. So we see a little bit",

And if we take a look at the volatility surface, let's take a look at 17j and like fab. So we see a little bit of inversion. And then it looks like we're back to put skew or 17j and but call skew on 21fab, which is interesting. So I'm, we got to keep an eye if the far out of the money's on GME call side for the 17j and start to take up a little bit, because that seems a little bit low. That just means that the market isn't necessarily pricing these as rich, which it tends to do and it's starting to price the downside a little bit more richly, which can kind of inform positioning a little bit. And then the last thing I want to mention with GameStop is I'm actually modeling now a covered strangle position in GameStop. So that's going to be, I think it's going to be I'm going to model a 10,000 trade on trading the coverage strangle in GameStop. And the purpose behind this is we did a poll on one of the live streams asking like what the average size was for GameStop. And people said like anything between like five and 10k. So I picked 10k and the plan now is to do updates on a covered strangle to show you how",

So I picked 10k and the plan now is to do updates on a covered strangle to show you how we can trade the equity, amplify it with options. So starting next week, I'll start sharing some updates on that. The position was established and all that it's up. So now it's time to run it, manage it and hopefully use it as a vector to help people learn not just about GameStop, but also how to use options to amplify positions, not just equity themselves, because especially something like GameStop, it's really useful, I think, and I tested it quite a lot at this point. So as always, anything you want me to take a look at, hit me up, throw it in the comments, shoot me an email, hit me up on X anything. I love taking a look at what you guys want me to talk about what you guys are interested in. It gives me a lot of focus. So thank you for sending that stuff in as you guys want me to look at stuff.
