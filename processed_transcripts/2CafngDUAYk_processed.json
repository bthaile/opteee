    "text": "Why do you think the trading failure rate is so high? You've heard numbers as high as 98 it's difficult to know actually because, fun fact, the brokers are literally disincentivized from publishing the data because they make money off of people trading. So they want you to trade. That's why they offer free education that typically involves having a bunch of legs on your option strategies. It's more transactions, that yadayada yadayada. But if you think about why most people actually fail at trading, it's because most people start from the exact and completely utterly wrong standpoint of thinking it's going to be fast easy money. And it's not, it's a really challenging environment. But one of the cool things is like any other skill set, it can be learned, you simply have to understand what you're trying to do and then put in the requisite amount of work to learn the skill. And if that's not interesting to you, you don't want to do that because it sounds like work, that's okay. Investing always works. Be an all our sealer.",
