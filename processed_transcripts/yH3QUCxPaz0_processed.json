And yeah, thanks for dealing with, again, the mobile setup. I know it's not as effective. Probably doesn't sound great. Not that it ever sounds very good. I'm not an audio engineer at all. So, you know, it's probably just part for the course for you guys. SP Norwall says, Eric, is there a way to check the options change from 2021? I'm curious what the strikes and potentially open interest was during the January explorations? Yeah, I've already looked through literally all of it. I have not on this computer, but I have all of that data downloaded. The options chain doesn't look too anomalous. There was a lot of heavy strikes for sure. And the volume came on pretty fast, but the it was very focal strikes that were busy. What I was even more interested in Norwall was what did the options chains look like like three months before January? And the reason why I was so interested in that is I wanted to know when did somebody whether it's not, and it's not just Warren Kitty, by the way, somebody meaning whoever else played this move because it wasn't just him. I was one of the people that that played the move. And the reason is because you could see it happening before it",

Now, what I'm curious, though, is who positioned well enough ahead of time to be able to get on like size before the rest of the market caught on because I was not the kind of person that would have been right in the beginning. So if we take a look at like a timeframe and we look all the way across the most of the people, like let's say number three here was January, most of the people started seeing what was going on like a month out. You can start seeing elements of stuff that looks weird. But I'm curious for the broader timeframe before that how effectively did people start catching on and seeing things. So Ricardo says, knew it might have that information. He doesn't. He doesn't have options, data, at least the last that he and I spoke, which is like he actually text me this morning. So yeah, it's he doesn't have the actual options change. Like I said, I actually have downloaded all of them directly from Seemo.

So from an options trading world for those that don't know that's it's literally what I do. So part of the way that I build strategies is I maintain a pretty significant data set that goes pretty far back in time. And it's full options chains. And the reason why I use full options chains is because it helps me further analyze strategies and whatnot. But to get that data is really expensive and it's not easy. So well, it's easy, just not easy to manage because it's really really heavy. It's a lot of the file sizes are massive because there's so much data that goes into it. So yeah, I literally have the entire change built out and not just for 20. I have the chains from continual. It's not just segmented timeframes to look through. But like the same thing you see in the stock, the options chains they can be very, very telling when you start to see volume ramping up changes in open interest ramping up. There's a lot you can learn from the options chains. So that's one of the things that we'll go through towards the end of this because right now as I view this, I'm still consuming all of the existing research.

And in the meantime, I'm doing this with you all to learn more about the existing theories and strategies that we have, which this is the one that we left off on. Last time, let me get this out of the way. Here. Ricardo says, Eric, can you check Givo? It's written a lot, I think, since you're so good at investigating, got in with DJT because you covered it. Maybe later, this stream is typically a little more focused on GameStop and like the background of GameStop. If you hit me with that on any of the other like standard live streams, always happy to.

So I'm happy to take a look at it with you. Bruce says, one of our key believes in the Moas theory hidden short interest. If I recall correctly, he was in the trade from valuation POV not necessarily from short interest POV. I agree with you. So I haven't seen anything from the cat that would lead me to believe that he's attempting to play this for quote unquote Moas. That's not to say that he's not. I have no idea what his underlying intentions are. But from the way that I've seen him trade it so far, it definitely doesn't lead me to believe that that's the underlying theory that he's that he's trying to play. What I've seen from his trades, and if you'll recall, we went through all of them. So let me grab our workbook really quick. Where is it at? And then I'll show you. So here's the workbook. And then if we go through this, this is when we went through back from the origin through all of his trades.

Because there's not a tremendous amount of timing that's tied to this. And I still don't see any significant evidence of some sort of perceptive timing theory that he's somehow figured out or broken down. I just don't see it at. And I want to be clear when I say that, that doesn't mean that it's not there. I just don't know because I can't see it. And there's always going to be two distinct parts of the way that I analyze stuff like this. There's going to be the stuff that I can see and can prove. And then there's going to be the stuff that I might have a hunch about or an idea. And there are different things. I can't prove anything related to any sort of underlying timing theory that he's employing. Based on the entire series of trades we've seen him run, there's nothing in here that would lead me to believe that there's a massive timing element.

So that tells me the options are primarily being used from a unit building perspective. And definitely for leverage. So a lot of this stuff isn't trying to optimize for Theta Decay as an optimizing for volatility. It's to gain leverage. And again, I can see that clearly from looking through his trades. It's one of the main things that I wanted to go through as far as I could is to get a sense of what was the overall approach because I'm not going to lie. When I first started looking at this stuff, one, I had no idea that he even traded options. I keep repeating that because it's so interesting to me. But like I genuinely had no clue that he traded options just from the overall sentiment that I picked up from the community regarding options. And then the second thing is it's also really clear that the theory that he applied came from a valuation standpoint. And then after watching some of his early streams, you can see that evolve a little bit in terms of like valuation, trying to be a value investor. And then what that actually meant",

In general, like in structure, it's very difficult to execute. It's very difficult for any normal rational human being to see a portfolio go from 586 million down to 235 four days later. Like that's that's crazy, right? Like that's crazy to go through that kind of cycle. But the other reality is is that even when you're in any of these numbers, once you're in this threshold of numbers, right? 11 million plus like you're sure you might not necessarily be buying a mega yacht with 11 million dollars, but you are set for the rest of your life in a very cushy kind of way. So part of the thing that I can probably surmise from this is that he made enough that he was able to just kind of keep playing the game because he also doesn't seem like a hyper materialistic guy.

And that it's one of the biggest things that I came across is at first I was expecting to see this really calculated precise approach. And after looking through the data, it's not that. This is somebody that is exceedingly comfortable with the risk he was taking on. And this is a proverbial lottery like that's that is the reality of there's a tremendous amount of luck that happened to coalesce with the timing of his stuff. He almost went insolvent in here. Like he he literally almost went away with his yellow account. And who knows if he would have came back with another one.

And you could tell by the entire premise of the original posts he did, yolo posts that when it is a professional in the industry, when you decide that you're going to be super speculative with 100,000, you write that off and your mind has gone. Like you put the 100,000 in the account, you pretend it's gone. That's not the money he needed. This is just side money that he wanted to see what he can do to play out this thesis. He picked an he picked an amount of money that made sense to literally play a yolo. And we can see that it's evidenced by the fact that he absolutely had other accounts because we can see in the live streams when he was walking through his tracker with his different positions in his yolo account, it's just game stop.

Let me get caught up on the chat really quick. Starbeef says agree. Arche said many, many times that Moas was not part of his thesis. He said it would be cool but he admitted he doesn't purport it to understand the short interest data. I believe it was in December 16th. I didn't I don't recall that personally so I would take you out your word there. Strategy says he seems to wear the various settlement rules. Newton mentioned it recently regarding ETF kicks with tweets mentioning or matching certain dates. I still don't see evidence of that. I would not say that that's not possible. It's entirely possible. And here's the other fun fact. This is something that is beyond an underlying suspicion but I genuinely think is the case. I think you guys are teaching him. That's what I think because he's smart but he is not smarter than everybody combined. And I also am like pretty average but I've been doing this a long time and I've learned a lot from you guys. So there is a near 100 probability that he's watching different content that's being put out about him looking at Superstong and I guarantee you that you guys are teaching him as well. So when it comes to the settlement cycles and stuff I can tell",

So when it comes to the settlement cycles and stuff I can tell you from this. He was not trading settlement cycles. Like that's not what this is. But what I also can tell you is that if he wasn't aware of settlement cycles previously he is now because I am now because you are now because as a community you all looked into it. You all started pulling the thread and identifying all of these little pieces that ultimately fit together. So I believe without a doubt that he is absolutely aware of this point. Again he was not trading here and I can see it right even this. If he's trading settlement cycles that's that's not what this is. You don't go from 210 to 289 to 586 down to 235 to 268 and then bounced. That's not the path. Because again if you're playing settlement cycles and if the theory is that he can essentially move the market on his own which to a degree he can. But there wouldn't be this portfolio volatility which wouldn't be there because there would be no reason for it to be there. He would have compounded so much faster than this. Which is an insane thing to say because he went from 100,000",

He would have compounded so much faster than this. Which is an insane thing to say because he went from 100,000 to like 600 million but it is absolutely the case. He would have compounded so much faster if he was playing cycles that he could reliably detect and trade. And again it's clear as day because if he's playing cycles you don't go from 47 million here down to 17 here that why why if you're playing a cycle why why would you do that? It doesn't make any sense. The other thing if he's playing these short term cycles of 30 days and stuff like that he's trading options that are much longer in terms of expiration. So that also tells me that the propensity to be trading settlement cycles which we're talking are about 35 days. So that's a different period than the things that he's trading and then the way that the portfolio moves. So I want to couch all of that with the fact that I don't know I really don't know but I can look at the path of what he's done and come up with the the best objective analysis as I possibly can. And if I were the one that we're playing cycles there's no reason to set things up this way. And",

I believe that he's accumulating long shares because he loves the company and because he wants to be a part of it he wants to support you guys he wants to lead you guys. And again from a military perspective you can tell a leader even though he leads in a strange way for what I would consider to be a leader but he's it's almost like the Batman he's kind of like the leader that you guys need. And his that like that's why he's doing all that stuff and because if you're playing cycles doing it with shares is also suboptimal because he's not as far as we can tell looking back through Newton sheet he's not unwinding shares. I have he reorganized this thing I already gave Newton a piece of my mind for that obviously joking but I told him that this sheet was hard enough to organize or to navigate in the beginning now I just I can't find anything because I don't know anything is is it here now this is all GME specific stuff used to have maybe it's off to the side he does",
