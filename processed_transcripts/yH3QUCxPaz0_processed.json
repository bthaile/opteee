We got Reese. We got Narwhal. Rapture's learned or Shlup. We got the game here. So it's great to see everybody. And yeah, thanks for dealing with again the mobile setup. I know it's not as effective. Probably doesn't sound great. Not that it ever sounds very good. I'm not an audio engineer at all. So you know, it's probably just part for the course for you guys. As P. Norwhal says, Eric, is there a way to check the options change from 2021? I'm curious what the strikes and potentially open interest was during the January explorations. Yeah, I've already looked through literally all of it. I have not on this computer, but I have all of that data downloaded. The options chain doesn't look too anomalous. There was a lot of heavy strikes for sure. And the volume came on pretty fast, but that it was very focal strikes that were busy. What I was even more interested in Narwhal was what did the options chains look like like three months before January? And the reason why I was so interested in that is I wanted to know when did somebody, whether it's not, and it's not just Warren Kitty, by the way, somebody meaning whoever else played this",

And the reason why I was so interested in that is I wanted to know when did somebody, whether it's not, and it's not just Warren Kitty, by the way, somebody meaning whoever else played this move because it wasn't just him. I was one of the people that that played the move. And the reason is because you could see it happening before it happened. Now what I'm curious, though, is who positioned well enough ahead of time to be able to get on size before the rest of the market caught on because I was not the kind of person that would have been right in the beginning. So if we take a look at a time frame and we look all the way across, the most of the people like, let's say number three here was January, most of the people started seeing what was going on like a month out. You can start seeing elements of stuff that looks weird. But I'm curious for the broader time frame before that, how effectively did people start catching on and seeing things. So over Carlos says, new might have that information. He doesn't. He doesn't have options data, at least the last that he and I spoke, which is like he actually texts me this morning.

So from an options trading world for those that don't know, that's literally what I do. So part of the way that I build strategies is I maintain a pretty significant data set that goes pretty far back in time. And it's full options chains. And the reason why I use full options chains is because it helps me further analyze strategies and whatnot. But to get that data is really expensive and it's not easy. So well, it's easy. Just not easy to manage because it's really, really heavy. It's a lot of the file sizes are massive because there's so much data that goes into it. So yeah, I literally have the entire chains built out and not just for 20. I have the chains from continual. It's not just segmented time frames to look through.

And I typically try to consume as much existing research on stuff like this before presenting my own research so that I'm not reinventing the wheel. I believe in group think and collective intelligence heavily.

But we might have some time at the end to take a peek through that. So I'm happy to take a look at it with you. Bruce says, one of our key beliefs in the Moas theory hidden short interest. If I recall correctly, he was in the trade from valuation POV not necessarily from short interest POV. I agree with you. So I haven't seen anything from the cat that would lead me to believe that he's attempting to play this for quote unquote Moas. That's not to say that he's not. I have no idea what his underlying intentions are. But from the way that I've seen him trade it so far, it definitely doesn't lead me to believe that that's the underlying theory that he's that he's trying to play. What I've seen from his trades and if you'll recall, we went through all of them. So let me grab our workbook really quick. Where is it at? And then I'll show you. So here's the workbook.

So his approach as far as I can see is really simple. In general, in structure, it's very difficult to execute. It's very difficult for any normal rational human being to see a portfolio go from 586 million down to 235 four days later. Like that's crazy. Like that's crazy to go through that kind of cycle. But the other reality is that even when you're in any of these numbers, once you're in this threshold of numbers, right, 11 million plus like you're sure you might not necessarily be buying a mega yacht with 11 million dollars, but you are set for the rest of your life in a very cushy kind of way.

I don't know because it doesn't have a massive social media presence, but that in and of itself tells you quite a lot. So he probably has more money than he could ever need his kid could ever need kid or kids. I don't know his family situation. I purposely don't look that far into it because it's none of my business. I don't know him. I'm not trying to dig into his personal life. That's I respect his personal life. But this stuff, like the trading stuff, obviously I'm fascinated by it. And that it's one of the biggest things that I came across is at first I was expecting to see this really calculated precise approach. And after looking through the data, it's not that. This is somebody that is exceedingly comfortable with the risk he was taking on. And this is a proverbial lottery win. Like that's that is the reality of there's a tremendous amount of luck that happened to coalesce with the timing of his stuff. He almost went insolvent in here.

And you could tell by the entire premise of the original posts he did, yellow posts that when it is a professional in the industry, when you decide that you're going to be super speculative with 100,000, you write that off and your mind has gone. Like you put the 100,000 in the account, you pretend it's gone. That's not the money he needed. This is just side money that he wanted to see what he can do to play out this thesis.

So I would take you at your word there. Strategy says he seems to wear the various settlement rules. Newton mentioned it recently regarding ETF kicks with tweets mentioning or matching certain dates. I still don't see evidence of that. I would not say that that's not possible. It's entirely possible. And here's the other fun fact. This is something that is beyond an underlying suspicion, but I genuinely think is the case. I think you guys are teaching him. That's what I think.

He would have he would have compounded so much faster than this. Which is an insane thing to say because he went from 100,000 to fucking 600 million. But it is absolutely the case. He would have compounded so much faster. If he was playing cycles that he could reliably detect and trade. And again, it's it's clear as day because if he's playing cycles, you don't go from 47 million here down to 17 here. That why why if you're playing a cycle, why why would you do that? It doesn't make any sense. The other thing if he's playing these short term cycles of 30 days and stuff like that, he's trading options that are much longer in terms of expiration. So that also tells me that the propensity to be trading settlement cycles, which we're talking are about 35 days.

I really don't know. But I can look at the path of what he's done and come up with the the best objective analysis as I possibly can. And if I were the one that we're playing cycles, there's no reason to set things up this way. And it's the same thing with accumulating long shares. I believe that he's accumulating long shares because he loves the company and because he wants to be a part of it. He wants to support you guys. He wants to lead you guys. And again, from a military perspective, you can tell a leader even though he leads in a strange way for what I would consider to be a leader. But he's it's almost like the backman. He's kind of like the leader that you guys need. And his that like that's why he's doing all that stuff. And because if you're playing cycles, doing it with shares is also suboptimal because he's not as far as we can tell looking back through Newton sheet, he's not unwinding shares. I have he reorganized this thing. I already gave Newton a piece of my mind for that. Obviously joking. But I told him that this sheet was hard enough to organize or to navigate in the beginning.",

No, this is all GME specific stuff. He used to have maybe it's off to the side. He does that too. He took stuff off to the side. So it's real squirreling and hidden. And what I'm trying to find is he has a thing in here somewhere that shows the share positions that he has. And he just keeps accumulating. So most of the share positions that we've seen, he's not unwound. And he's continued to this looks like for the company. This looks like more GD settlement stuff. This is all settlement cycle. I don't know what this is. This is some max pain tracking. I really thought I was in here, but clearly I'm wrong. How crazy is this sheet?

I know it's in here somewhere because you wouldn't have gotten rid of that. But yeah, it's been there somewhere. Anyways, there's a thing in here somewhere that walks through all of Vorinkittie's positions in a stock position. And he's accumulating. If you're playing settlement cycles, accumulating shares doesn't allow you to participate because you have to unwind the shares to realize the game. So he's accumulating shares, building more and more shares. That to me leads more strongly back to his premises. It's a value guy in liking the stock and liking the company and liking Cone. So I think that the idea that he's cracked this underlying code that literally the entire community hasn't been able to sift out yet, I just find that to be exceedingly unlikely. Again, it's possible. It's entirely possible. But when I'm analyzing stuff, there's two ways that I analyze things. There's what's possible and then there's what's probable. And what's more probable is the simpler explanation that we went through earlier with respect to his approach. And my guess is you guys are teaching him now, which I think is really cool.

The memes that he post match whatever your pattern seeking mind wants it to match. That's the trick with stuff like this. He could be talking about antagonizing market makers and drawing them on and riding them. He could be talking about a bunch of different things. And that's the purpose of ambiguous communication is it allows you to figure out what you think it may or may not mean. But one of the things I've mentioned about him before that I genuinely believe to be the case. Again, as far as I can tell from my analysis of him is I think when he wants you to know what he's talking about, he makes it clear. And then I think when he just wants to play games and just have some fun and put something more obscure out there, I think he does that too. Because as I've mentioned before, communication is really fascinating. It's one of the things we learn a lot in the military.

But CEOs typically have different compensation packages depending on the company and depending on like what they're doing. But there's not many CEOs out there that don't take a comp. And it's 100 because he really cares about the company, the community, and he's trying to turn this thing around. What a story that would be for him to essentially save this thing.

So he like again, like he doesn't need the money. He doesn't need the money. He's rich. So yeah, he's working on a general passion project. It definitely sets a really good message because you have to think of it also from a branding perspective. And people like Cohen, they're playing chess. They're playing chess in 4D. So he knows that one of the reasons why GameStop is still a freaking company is because of the community. It's because of you all. It's because of the apes. And the apes have made sure that the company",

So from him, you can almost look at it as really cheap marketing because everybody talks about how he doesn't take a salary. So whatever his salary would have been, you can essentially, mentally bucket that as what he's spending in marketing because everybody talks about it. And it's cheap. Even if you made half million dollars a year, the amount of conversation of him not taking a salary provides is so tremendous that that's cheap. It's cheap marketing. No, I'm not saying that that's the sole reason why he's doing it. But I also know he knows that, right? It's again, you have to you have to respect the fact that people like him, they're not superficial thinkers. They're thinking in layers and levels. And that is one of the things that Cohen will absolutely be thinking of. It's super cheap marketing. And it provides a really great connection with the community that literally kept the stock alive.

So I think he's in a position most importantly where he just doesn't need the money. Then it allows him to position the message to be what he wants it to be. Now I would have to imagine if he if his net worth was 200,000, my guess is he probably would take a salary because he probably would need it in order to continue to make ends meet like most people do. So he's fortunate enough to be in a position where he literally, and for those that don't know how much for 0.9 or just call it 5 billion, it's hundreds of millions of dollars. It's more than he could ever spend. It's more than the next three generations of him could ever spend. And that's even being disgustingly exuberant with spending.

Titi says it would have been a great collab if only the CEO and board of AMC were predatory shooters of their own company. Oh, I see. Okay. I can't wait to see predatory AMC board working with RC. People think AMC killed the GMEs squeeze and they were wrong. See. I just would encourage people to remember the way that the last squeeze went. And to just consider what a future squeeze might look like. And the reason why I say that is I'm hopeful that that might lead to people being less at each other's throats and more direct that energy towards the structure of things, which probably deserves more of the attention versus one another.

Newton is looked pretty hard at 21 and 35. I think Newton is settled on 35. And then also with the holiday component, though, which is important because that that skews things. And it has to be tracked. Major spike for GameStop could push a big player into default. Again, this goes back to my question that I still don't have an answer to. And I've asked it a few times and I'm going to continue asking it because I'm hoping to see. And so it looks like I'm back. Let me know if this is okay. Just the, it looks like the Wi-Fi drop real quick. But I think we're back online. There's not like a big snowstorm going on right now, but there's definitely a good bit of snow coming down.

A coffee says it's amazing the shorts can attack treasury bonds. That's the bedrock of a system, like, is nothing sacred. Well, I don't think you need about that.

So it's, can you take the ways all three of them? DTCS, you're already ready to pull the plug. The other thing just to be really clear when we look at this is the margin call doesn't trigger a default inherently. A margin call is done to actually prevent default and it's to prevent widespread catastrophe. So now if there are a series of margin calls done in succession, that absolutely can become a problem. And that can siphon out liquidity and it can absolutely to pretty massive problems like we saw in 08.

This is never going to get better and have to take the money out in order to save it. And as you probably would imagine, he took the money out.

And that's how you end up like my brother taking your money out instead of compounding it massively, spending it on bullshit that doesn't matter, and then wishing instead that we had compounded it. Okay. K goes those guys abuse what five times leverage and you just all would affect head on the market. Imagine how bad leverage must have been abused by the law. Chairs is still running today. So let's actually take a look at that real quick. This is what I was looking for. There's a couple studies that actually talk about this. We can take over care. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Booy. Big peak. And let's zoom this in so that our friends in the back can peep it. Okay. So this is from European securities and markets authority. Assmart. They do a lot of different studies not just related to European markets as you expect. And they used archaicos as a lot of people did as a case study because there's absolutely a lot to learn from. So let's take a peek. Says in March 21, the default of archaicos, the US family office led to large losses for",

Says in March 21, the default of archaicos, the US family office led to large losses for some global banks. Archaicos was able to accumulate large exposures to two and leverage on equities by entering into derivative transactions with bank counterparts when the price of the underlying stocks started to decline. The firm was unable to meet variation margins resulting in the liquidation of the stocks by the counter party banks, which is important. So here are the losses that the companies various companies ate. So credit sues, Nomura, Maurice the only UBS. And I mean, this is no love lost, right? Just to be clear, the losses are big. This is a drop in the fucking bucket for companies like this. So they do not want to consume losses like this, obviously. But this is also not what you see from what this kind of makes you believe. Those guys abuse what five times leverage and you saw an effect that had on the market. It absolutely had an effect on the market.

Actually, what did, let's, that would be fun to take a look at. What CS did in 2021 for its annual earnings? Reddit sues 2021 earnings. So it had a fourth quarter loss of 2.17 billion in a full year net loss of 1.57 billion. And it had a 2.7 billion profit in 2020. So then let's take a look at credit sues earnings year over year. And here we go. As expected. Credit. So credit sues had 19.9 billion in 22 revenues. You know, real sad. It's actually really bad for them. 28 Bill in 2020, 28 Bill 19. So the company is still making tremendous revenue. Absolutely tremendous revenue. So the, again, just the point is Mr. Boggsham says, hasn't changed the status quo yet. Exactly.

And let's take a look. So this is MS from 21. This is a year 21 net revenue, 59 billion. They were fine. 6.2 billion net revenues, right? So they, they took a loss. They had a losing position as anything does. But as any good risk manager does, they manage the rest. They had a better spread in their portfolio. And they were able to eat the loss. It didn't even do rail them for the year, which is kind of crazy if you think about it. I had to pop in instructions. We're meeting some folks that we met earlier today for dinner and I just got to see where we're going. All right. So it's like 17 minutes away. That's easy day. And cool. Yeah.

The one of the things to highlight for the settlement cycles is it's difficult to pick where we want to start. So and then that can slide us off by an individual day or two days. It just makes it tricky to manage and track. You're right. So oh, this is actually interesting. I'm excited to read this one. Well, we'll switch off after this one and just kind of bullshit a little bit about anything else that you guys want to cover. But oh, that's okay too far.

The other thing I can tell you though is the difference between you and I is, again, you probably haven't seen the phone numbers yet because they've not come up unfortunately.

    "text": "pretty well for me. So I'm pretty confident and comfortable with my approach. But yeah, obviously you got to do whatever is right for you. And I hope that you have a solid approach that you're comfortable with. That's the cool part about this whole thing is everybody has to do what they're comfortable with and what makes sense for them. I just want to see. Yeah, find that spot. I didn't see this. Yeah, man. I'm really happy about that. Rory and T.D. says Michigan is a life where yeah, that's cool. Whatever, whatever works for him. The thing that I just remind people like him and other people is that what's right for you and what works for you is cool. But that might not be what's right for somebody else. So for somebody to think that their way is the only way is the epitome of ignorance. And each person has to do what's right for them. That's what it boils down to. That's the concept of a marketplace. It's how this whole thing works is people have to decide what makes sense for them. And only you can decide that. Yeah. That's my .02. Cool. And then for those that didn't see, I did do a GameStop recap video yesterday just because I didn't do anything about it really during the week. And we had an options expiration that's actually probably when I'm going to start doing GameStop videos. I might just start doing them on",

And we had an options expiration that's actually probably when I'm going to start doing GameStop videos. I might just start doing them on Friday. Unless there's other stuff that's going on. And you can see here, the last options expiration was pretty interesting because we were pretty deep past Max Payne. And we saw the market hold what I would consider to be some pretty, pretty key levels. So that was pretty cool to see. Michigan says he's probably paid a game followers. And then when it's time, when it's sell time, he'll take the money and tell people to sell a k a gym creamer. That's funny. The fun part about YouTube is I don't know how many ads you saw during this, but it should be zero because I have the ads for the live streams even turned off. So I actually make nothing doing this. So if you want to pay me to do it though, that would be sick. That would be really, really cool because I do spend a lot of time doing this. And right now, as I said, I don't even have the ads turn on. So I don't really make a whole lot on no income source. So if I apply your methodology, then I just have to hold stuff so that I can't make",

So if I apply your methodology, then I just have to hold stuff so that I can't make money off that either. Maybe that's a typical, that's a really difficult model. Actually, as I think about it. All right. Let's see if there's anything else that Newton has updated here. There are 15s. Interesting. So he also is, he's flagging periods where he's expecting because of large stock movements. That's interesting to me. Yeah. Super interesting. All right. Okay. Let me wrap up from the head out. We're going to go link up some friends that helped pull us out after I got the car stuck in the snow. So I'm going to go kick it for a little bit, take the amount for a drink. And I hope everybody has a killer rest of your weekend. There will be a live stream tomorrow. We'll figure out the time and all that stuff. And as always, if you guys need anything, let me know.
