I'm going to walk you through what they are, how I use them, why they might be useful for your toolkit because for me specifically, these are actually an important part of what I do and namely because a lot of the strategies that I use like the coverage strangle, the diagonal they unlocked leverage and one of the ways you can capitalize on the leverage is putting the money to use that is otherwise scheduled for those other strategies as I listed them. So I'm going to walk you through the strategy first and then give you a couple examples on how I like to use them and then finally the management of the strategy. So what's up everybody Eric here welcome backs all the all ours. Let's get right to it. So the very first thing what is an option box spread? Well realistically the reason why we use this is it's a way to arbitrage the risk free rate from the market. And if you don't know what arbitrage means, it's essentially way for us to guarantee a profit with no risk. And there are instances that you can do it, but notice how I say via the risk free rate. The reason why that part is important is because there's not this magical trade that you're finding that just gives you free money. This is just a essential way to either loan money to the market or get money from the market. Be",

Well, really, it's just a debit put spread plus a debit call spread and a walk you through what that looks like in just a second, but there are a couple of important notes upfront. The very first thing, you have to use European options. Let me reinforce that point, you have to use European options. If you do not use European options, the risk of early assignment exists. And there's a dude on Reddit that lost a whole bunch of money lost like 50,000 to a box spread in UVXY, because he thought he was smart and his thesis was decent. The product was completely wrong. You need to not be at risk of early assignment. So don't use American options, use European options. And really the product I use the most for this is the SPX keeps it simple. And that also answers the second point here, which is liquidity, you got to have liquidity in this trade. One of the things that eats this trade alive more than anything are fees. If you have high commission cost large bid ask spreads, this is a very difficult strategy to use with any amount of efficacy. So as you can tell here, we're talking about the concept of arbitrage.

If you have high cost, that's a problem. You're going to eat away at any of the potential rewards you have available to you. So we need to be mindful of costs. And the last thing, timing is variable, you can do that's one of my favorite things about these kinds of trades is you can deploy them in all different kinds of time frames. So for example, if we look at the SPX here, you can see all these different explorations. And right now I have a box spread out in 17 March, this started as an 18 days to expiration trade, which I'm going to walk through this whole trade in its entirety for the example, but you can essentially establish box breads wherever you want.

And that's actually one of the most important parts of the way that I deploy the strategy is because it's typically slaved to a broader strategy that I'm using. And I need to be more careful about the timing of this because I need the capital to be available for the other trade. Now one last note is if you are long the box spread or long the box, you are loaning money means you're paying money, but going to get more back at expiration. And then if you're short the box spread, it means you're borrowing money, you're going to get money upfront, but then you're going to have to pay back the principal and then the interest at the end of the trade come expiration. All right, so what does this look like? Well, this is the like a gist of this is the trade I just showed you. And this is a long call spread and a long put spread. It's got to be the same expiration and the same strikes.

So essentially, the way that this trade works is you are going to pay a debit out. And then you are going to get more back. So what does this look like? When I first put this trade on, it was 18 days to expiration. So a little less than three weeks, it was a thousand points wide, right? So 4,000 of 5,000 thousand points wide. So that means that each contract represents 100,000. Why do I use 100? Why did I use 1000 points wide? It's so that I don't have to trade as many of them. You don't have to trade them this wide. You could trade them 10 points wide, five points wide, whatever you want. But if you want to put on a sizable position, it's a little more efficient to go a little bit wider. So in this case, each each contract here represents 100,000 in total. So in this case, the total loan out is worth 1 million. But the loan amount, what did I actually give to the market is 997,725.

So we have 1,000 points. You got to multiply it by 100, like you typically would for your options, because there are 100 lots. So that gets you to your 100,000. And then it's a 10 lot. So you add one more zero. That's the total loan value. And the loan amount is the debit that you pay. So in this case, it came out to that. And it represents a 4.6 annualized return on a Vesic capital, which is a little less after fees than the risk-free rate as it is. But that's the nature of the trade. And I'll walk you through why I set them up this way. But on this trade, I'm essentially sending out 997,000. And I'm going to get back 22.75. So this is not a bad gross 1 million amount. But obviously it's just not a good return on a Vesic capital. If you think about the actual return on this, it's less than half a percent. But again, it's all designed to work in tandem with other strategies.",

If you think about the actual return on this, it's less than half a percent. But again, it's all designed to work in tandem with other strategies. So what I mean by that is right now, I still have money put to work for things like the coverage strangle. And this money would be sitting there otherwise doing nothing. Meanwhile, the coverage strangle is still completely secured. Now there's a couple risks when you do this. The first thing is there's always the risk when you're running something like the coverage strangle of early assignment. And if the money is not there, that's a problem. So one of the things I tell people is like, let's say for example, I have a really deep in the money short put. I'm not going to put the capital for that trade into a box spread because the propensity for early assignment is still relatively high, especially if there's not a lot of time value left in those options. So that's one scenario that I would not deploy a box spread. The second scenario that you have to consider is the timing of your trades. So for example, in this box spread, I have 11 days left to go. That means that the cash is going to come available on 11 days. I don't want to buy this back early",

And that's another spread that you have to cross all eats into the profitability. I want to take this trade to expiration and let it expire. It's a cash settled product. So even if one of these is in the money and one of them's not in the money or whatever, it doesn't matter. That's another reason why I trade the SPX is because it's cash settled. It doesn't matter if it winds up in between the legs. It's going to be a full profit if I let it expire. But let's say for example, I had a trade in IWM that's going to require X number of dollars. And that actually expires on the ninth of March. Well, now I've just created a timing issue because the cash for the coverage strangle, which expires nine March, is tied up until 17 March. So let's say that part of my overall trade thesis for the coverage strangle is to take a assignment and let's say that those short puts are deep in the money. And I still have all that cash available, but it's tied up in this box spread that's not going to come out",

It's not insurmountable. There's ways to go about it. You could take a assignment on margin and then pay the margin fee and so your box spread comes available because here's the thing with the box spread. When you put the trade on, there is some important metrics for an account. I haven't blocked out because it's privacy, but if you think about the netlicking daytrades, that's how much your account is worth if you flatten everything. The cash and sweep is how much actual cash is available in your account. So the margin requirement for this trade, as you can see, is only 18,000. It doesn't require a lot of money, but it takes a lot of cash. So what that means is I still have plenty of capital available to trade options to trade on margin because it actually is a very low margin requirement. But what ends up happening is I use all of the cash that's available if you put on too many box spreads. And then you essentially, if you get assigned early, you have the room in your account based",

So right now I could take this trade down for 600 profit. I don't because it still has time left in the trade. Now I want to talk to you about one other risk in this trade. And that is the risk free rate. So as the risk free rate changes, when you put the trade on, obviously, you're establishing your value, but let's say race increased while I was in this trade. Well, then now I'm kind of not in an ideal scenario because there's a better rate available and I'm locked into this rate.

So box spreads are a fantastic way to utilize leverage and the rest of the cash and the portfolio, why it's being used for other things. You just have to be pragmatic and smart about the way you do it. But this has been one of the hallmarks of what I tend to do, especially coupled with the covered strangle strategy because the covered strangle is very capital intensive. So this is a way to earn something while the covered strangle is still working and still has all the cash available to it. So while rates start to increase or they maintain a level that at least makes sense to run the strategy, I tend to run it. Now when we were in essentially a near zero interest rate environment, I didn't bother with it because after fees, there wasn't much to walk out with. But that's not always the case, especially as we get rates back to a normal place. So if you have any questions in the box spread, obviously, this is all predicated on being long the box spread, loading the money. I don't use this to take money, although you could very reasonably. And you can get it at a good rate from the market like this. So if you have any questions on the box spread, hit me up. Let me know. Happy to hit them",
