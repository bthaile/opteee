    "text": "option box spreads I'm going to walk you through what they are how I use them why they might be useful for your toolkit because for me specifically these are actually an important part of what I do and namely because a lot of the strategies that I use like the coverage triangle the diagonal the unlocked leverage and one of the ways you can capitalize on The Leverage is putting the money to use that is otherwise scheduled for those other strategies as I listed them so I'm going to walk you through the strategy first and then give you a couple examples on how I like to use them and then finally the management of the strategy so what's up everybody Eric here welcome back to all the hours let's get right to it so the very first thing what is an option box spread well realistically the reason why we use this is It's a way to Arbitrage the risk-free rate from the market and if you don't know what Arbitrage means it's essentially a way for us to guarantee a profit with no risk and there are instances that you can do it but no notice how I say via the risk-free rate the reason why that part is important is because there's not this magical trade that you're finding that just gives you free money this is just a essential way to either loan money to the market or get money from the market yep",
