In again the video that I was sharing with you guys and that's in the chat I literally give you a list of different edges that you start with the conversation now from the idea of finding something and then I want to talk about how we explore something to ideally complete the rest of this process but before I do that are there any questions on what we talked about so far?

I'm just going to flip through these really quick. This one is definitely a must read. I'll throw these into the chat for you guys. This one's ready here and I have the links. Another one. Relative strength is solid by the way. That's another really good tool. Cool. Let's continue that. We now know how to find ideas for edge. We started the stream from the context of somebody that's going to be a big, big edge. You now know what edge is and you have a starting point on how to find it. Once we identify something that looks interesting to us that we think that there might be an effect, then we need to research the effect itself. That's where there's really a big departure in terms of the approach of traders. Ideally, you learn how to conduct basic data analysis and statistical analysis. That's the best approach. If you're not ready for that, the next thing you could do is use base observations and then see if something holds true. For example, let's see what this one says specifically.

Let's see that improve risk adjusted returns. Relative strength model tested in French farmers. Sector back to the 20s increased absolute returns. Relative strength portfolios outperform by in whole benchmark. The addition of trend following parameter to dynamically hedge. Decreases volume drawdown. Relative strength model is then tested across a portfolio. Yes, so this is solid. So let's download this. I'm literally showing you step by step. What to do? At least for those that aren't familiar with how to run your own data analysis yet. Next, what I'm doing is I'm opening up Grock. And I'm taking the thing that I just downloaded. And I'm dropping it in. So I'm closing this just because we don't need it. It's going to be in Grock. And we're here. So now I'm going to say. Read this paper. Summarize the key findings. Create a trading strategy based on the concepts within. Now again. I would read the paper, right? Like, don't do this. I've already read this paper.

Now the other reality is is like, if you don't know how to read scientific research. Ask AI to help you because there's a specific way to read it. It's not like reading a book. You have to be a little more nuanced than that. But let's see. The core method involves ranking assets by trailing total returns over periods of 1, 3, 6, 9, 12. What does this sound like? Momentum. Across all ranking periods, relative strength portfolios consistently outperform by in whole benchmark. That I did it. Yeah, I great, great, great, great, great. Let's see what the strategy is. So we have five global assets. So this is using S&P, foreign stocks, bonds, commodities, and REITs. And then this says you're going to invest in the top three. This is a very basic momentum approach balances concentration. So by the way, in case you don't know with momentum style strategies. When you see ranking sort holds like this like top three, top five, bottom three, bottom five, bottom two, almost always they perform better with fewer. But they're now more path dependent if something wonky happens to happen during the time that that trade is on.

Now you have to determine what number it makes sense. But again, this is giving you a starting point. So now it's saying allocate to an asset if price is above its own 10 month MA if below allocate the portion to cash. So what could we logically do next? The next thing we could do is we could literally download price data or these things. So let's take a look. Let's go here just because I have the ability to download data from here. And let's go how far back we want to go 95's a little bit long because some of the other ETFs wonky will back that far. I'll have to figure that out in a second. I'm going to start it from 2000 because I don't want to get rid of 2008. That's actually a really, really important time frame for us. We want 2008. And it's because without that we miss some important like drawdown details. So that's yeah, we definitely want that. So there's spy. We also want EFA TLT. So let's grab TLT. Download. There we go.

So let's grab TLT. Download. There we go. We want that. We want EFA. By the way, the strategy that we're looking at now. This isn't unique to these assets. It's just being applied to this data set. You can literally apply this to just about any working momentum factor. So you can do it within individual indices sectors. I typically do a sector version. That's actually how I talk to you guys about the trades from what last Friday that I put on in healthcare. Literally based on this. What else is in here? DBC and VNQ. DBC. Got it. And then VNQ. Got it. So now what I'm going to do is upload all of these into grock. Again, I'm just using grock because I've happened to be tinkering with it more lately. You can use whatever makes you happy. One of the things I know right out of the gate is that this data is not clean yet. But that's okay. So now I'm going to tell it.

Oceano says SSRN ranking top authors economics is worth a visit. It's a great call. One thing to keep of really, really important note of that I want to make sure that you guys are aware of. Looking at economics with respect to the market is a fucking rabbit hole that catches a lot of people. There's nothing wrong with it and it's useful in general. But do not get stuck trying to analyze GDP employment claims. Economics becomes a little too disconnected from what you're actually trying to trade and it's really intricate. This is actually why this isn't like some sort of hot take. If you look at the average performance of like economic based funds compared to other funds, they don't typically do well. And it's for a very specific reason. There's actually a breadth of research out there on the relationship between economics and the market. So I just saw the word economics, which made me think about that. It's again, not bad. Do it. It's okay to look at, but all I'm saying is don't get sucked down a rabbit hole thinking that there's some. See great economic M1 M2 relationship for the money supply indicator that now has edge.

The other thing that I want to talk about with respect to creating edge as this thing is going. You have to think about what you're doing as a process with feedback loops. And again, this is why I give you all the outlier strategy processes starting point, but I'll summarize like the core movements that you need to execute. So you need to observe something. This is how we come up with ideas. Once you observe something, you need to study it. And the something that we're looking for is a profit mechanism. Then you need to study your profit mechanism. Once you study it and you have details pertaining to it, then we need to think about devising strategies before that typically what I would do is just look at structures. The reason why I'm looking for structures is I'm not trying to get site like two narrow focus, Siphon into just looking at strategies prematurely.

I have no why is it going to fucking Yahoo. All right. Quick intermission. I am going to open up a chat with chat you PT and then I'm going to effectively tell to do the same thing. I kind of noticed sometimes when I do this with rock, it loses its mind a little bit. So read the attached paper, create a trading strategy, from it, apply the strategy to the attached pickers, by state and summarize the performance. So we'll let that, we'll let that simmer.

So for example, let's say that we find this rank and sort of like the top three, bottom three, and let's say that we want to test buying calls, selling puts. And let's say when we're testing buying calls, we try some different things, what expiration do you choose? You apply your foundational options knowledge to figure out what kind of profiles you want. But maybe you start with understanding whatever the average holding duration is. Let's say that you start with 70 TE and that this is rolled weekly. Then let's say that there's 30 TE, 60, 90, 180. Fine. So you have what five different terms that you're going to explore for this effect. And then we repeat that on this side. This is for the top three. Then for the bottom three, we look at the same windows. But instead, we look at long puts in short calls. Okay. Now we have some starting point on what we might want to look at.

This way you don't necessarily need options data and stuff like that. Again, it's not as effective. But you can also use a platform like think or swim.

And let's just see what this might look like. Let's go to beginning of the year. Two Jan. And it already gave us our general instructions. So this is saying. This one's going to be long only. The stop loss. It looks like some sort of rotation monthly. So sell if an asset drops out of the top three or fails a simple moving average filter. Sell it month close and reallocate. Only allocate if the asset prices above a 10 month SMA. Okay. So the first thing we need to do is create a little table for us to use. Let's find some space for us to play. Looks like this will work.

One of the things that people do when they're trying to test stuff like this is they want to try to see if they could get a fill at the mid price. And if you're back testing something, you'll get very unrealistic fills. Just transact at the bit or the offer. If the difference of your strategy making money versus not is whether or not you get this 20, 30 cent differential, you have a bigger fucking problem than the strategy in where you're getting filled. That's the reality of it. So to normalize, I just use whatever the bit or the offer is. Just stick there. The I'm going to skip doing too much of the like the delta gamma stuff because I don't really care about any of that in this context. The next thing I said that we would do is a DT.

So yeah, I would just either diagnose it or exactly is Oceano is saying, just have it give you a rundown of what you should do. See, it says, would there be any value in back testing against going long the underlying and then assuming that buying out of the money calls would give you similar results? Or do the Greeks, non-linear is make it too far off? Um, yeah, I would not, you can't make that assumption because it really wouldn't be similar results. And you'll be able to see that actually in this exercise that we're doing together. Now, what you could do is create like a planning factor for how they're different to simplify it going forward. But there definitely would be enough nuances that I would not feel comfortable saying something like buying at the money calls will perform the same as being, you know,",

It's inaccurate. Now, what I would feel comfortable saying is that no matter what we know this effect is profitable by both of these that I think is okay. You, El Domus, you'll Domus as somebody who never traded before is options better to start with future stocks or for X. Not necessarily. I would say I would avoid for X for sure, but when it comes to starting to trade actually beginning with equity stocks is a lot simpler. There's a lot of nuances with options, but what I would say to somebody that's never traded before is that if you wanted to start trading stock, for example, I would absolutely simultaneously learn options because in the long run, they will be useful to you for sure. But in the near term, probably not probably not quite as much. All right, we just did the 31, the 28th, sadly. Now we have 31 March.

What do we have so far? Well, we can see that we're losing money across the board. I can also see that based on the day's expiration. There's a relationship with the P&L. So let's take a look at that. If I drop in a table on this. For a chart, I should say. I can get a sense of how these are behaving relative to one another. So I'm plotting the day's to expiration. And then I'm plotting the subsequent P&L for the same move. And there's usable information in here for me. One of those things that immediately looks interesting is the fact that the 57 is actually a little bit lighter compared to where you would think it would be compared to the 29 and 88. We could postulate a few reasons why that might be the case. One of the reasons why that might be the case is actually a liquidity factor.

Maybe these are the ones we just got a bad price for as compared to this one, where we might have gotten a good or favorable price for. You be the one. Don't know yet. So that's our first plot. Now what we need to do is rebuild this trade really quick for the seven days expiration after we validate if it's above the 10 month of May, which it is. I'm not going to make any adjustments to the other ones yet, meaning the other trades because it's rebalance monthly. We're only bothering with the seven days, which I just realize I'm not going to keep bothering with. So I'm going to switch this to monthly so that we can get through more faster. So it's already almost six. What I did now is I took the seven day down and I just moved it down here to kind of like a closed section. So this would be the open section in the log. And then this would be the closed section. And then I can still summarize. Performance of our trades in here. Like this. I won't bother with the rest of.

So let's see how our positions did again. I'm going to get rid of that. Okay. So our 31 Jan is now at 1781. Our 28 Fab is at 24. Nope. That's a lie. That one's at the bottom. So we're going to get rid of the 29. So we're going to get rid of the 29. Then we're at 1395. Then we're at 31 March is 2422. And then we're at 3309. Okay. So let's see how these did comparatively.

The reason for the difference in performance that you see here is really, really simple. You see that difference in performance. Because these experienced more faded decay than this one did. Also probably a change in vol. This part of the term structure didn't change that much. So we have again usable information. So let's plot this. Now what I'm going to do is recreate this exercise one more time. So the first thing I'm going to do is redo this sorting. We now need to do. We're going to be 31 Jan, which is our next time window. And we go through the same exercise. Let's start. This one is above. And our trailing 12 month is 24.1%. This should look pretty familiar to what we tested already. Next we have EFA. EFA is now above. Technically. If it's above, trailing 12 month is 5.9%. Next is TLT. TLT is still below, and trailing 12 month is negative 7.6. BBC is next once below. 12 is negative 2.7 so that one is recovering and then it fell. Then VnQ, this one is above. And trailing 12 is 7.9. Okay. So we have a slightly different scenario here.

So I'm only going to do 2. The other thing I'm not going to bother with is running all these different explorations. I want to be very, very clear. If I were doing this exercise on my own, I would absolutely use all of these. The only reason why I'm only going to do one expiration for each is for time. That's it. But what I'm going to do is use the one that perform the best from this really small sample. You can't actively conclude anything effectively from what we've seen so far. I'm giving you all the caveats of the data analysis rules that I'm breaking for the sake of showing you a more important process component versus the actual outcome of this one. Okay. So we need to find the closest to 1.80. And in this case, I don't really love either of these, but we'll do the 20 June.

Why we're doing analyzing the information that we're getting as a quick level set on where we're at in this broader process? We're testing to see like what kind of edge may or may not exist here. Okay. So spy is at 60918 expiration. We're just going to use the same expiration of 20 June. It's going to be a one lot. And we're going to use the 606 20s because they're more liquid. We're going to get those for minus 1906 and our Delta is a 48 a little bit light. But that's okay. All right. So now let's fast forward to the end of February. And let's see how we did.

It is 9366 and the premium for our 92s is now like five. Well, it'll be like 490 to use the other side. 4.9. Okay. Here's our performance for this month. The underlines changed respectively by 2.5% and 378. The way that you can normalize these against one another is by comparing the spot price change performance against your return on invested capital. And you can see which one's performed relative to the others. So this gives us a net P&L here of 1059. What I'm going to do down here is get rid of these other data points from the sample and I want to focus on the one that we did so that we can track one more month of performance for these. So I'm going to take these drop these in. And we have our aggregate P&L right now. We're down 140.

For VNQ we clearly are above our 10 month and the trailing 12 month return is 11.5%. Spy is still above it's 10 month SMA trailing 12 month return is 15.6. EFA is above it's 10 month trailing 12 month performance is 5. ELT is below trailing 12 minus 1.1. DBC is below trailing 12 month is minus 0.8. So we have our picks again for this month which is going to be spy and be in Q respectively. So let's get those pulled up again and let's get our positions. So now we are at 28th Ed. We're going to have spy and be in Q. Spot price for spies 586 16. And again we're going to use that like 180 ish.

We're going to pay 510 and we're getting a 49 delta. Grab spy. We're going to look in that same 19 step expiration to keep it the same. Strike price for the 50 delta puts us here at the 600's. Premium we're going to pay is 2641 and then our delta here is 0.5. Now we fast-forward and we rebalance monthly. If during this process I see any of them cross below the 10 month SMA I'm going to go to that point.

So what you can tell I'm doing is I'm not going back in cherry picking stuff. I'm literally applying the strategy as it's outlined and I'm saying to myself how did this perform and where would the system itself had necessitated a change and we can clearly see when that is. So this is now at 89. No, I'm 958. And let's take a look at the premium for our options which were the 95s. Those are going to come down for 360. Again, we're using the bid for where we're going to sell. And then I'll do the same thing for spy and then we'll stop after this. What I want to do is just see what the performance",

So let you have a comparison. S&P is at 567 65. Our premium or the 600s out here is at 1797. So that's where you get out. And let's take a look at the last Friday of the month which would be 28 March. And let's see where everything would sit. So here's where we're at so far. Our total P&L on the here is down 1134. Again, depending on like what the account size and stuff is, which we don't really have in this example. The next thing that we care about is how did the underlines do up into this point. So we need the spy price from the start of the year and the VNQ price from the start of the year. Right now we had spy start at 587.6 and then we had VNQ at 91. 37. And there's two ways you can test the performance so far. You can test from your entry point to where they are now. But this is a rotation strategy.

So I wouldn't even track that one there necessarily. It doesn't have a seat at the table. What that means is we have to track these relative to what they are, which is what of the underlines done so far in the year we can do that with spy. So right now we are at what is it 28 March? And spot price right now at 28 March is 56765. So then we can take a look at what the return is over this time frame, which is down effectively 20 points and down about 3%. 3.4%. For VNQ and whatever you can test those individually as well. But the main thing here is you want to be able to say to yourself like how would I have done doing this so far compared to just whatever the underlying is done. You then would add your portfolio level details on top of this. So how are we sizing these trades? This was like two grams. So let's say that this was what like a $10,000 portfolio?

Our current balance at the end of this so far is this. Our overall return is this. And then we can see what our net performance is comparatively, which is down 11%. Now again, this isn't necessarily a direct comparison because this is just looking at the performance of the underlying itself. So now we need to add one more comparison so we have a portfolio and then we have a buy and hold equivalent using the same amount of money. So in this context, the buy and hold here would be $10,000. Just like you see here. Then what we would do is take our $10,000. Mine is our $10,000 times this return. Oops. Oops. Let's just do this first. Is that, oh stop this. Oh, it's because the fucking negative. This times absolute. This. Good. So three, thirty nine or so. So you're down definitely less, right?

And then you can see if you have an edge. Mike drop. About as easy as it gets. So you're taking something that somebody else built effectively. And then you're seeing, how does it perform?

Think about what we just went through as a collective. That's why the edge that you might expect to see from something like this isn't going to be that much. Why would it be? This is not a lot of work. We didn't even devise the strategy. We literally ripped the strategy from a paper. And then we tweaked it slightly by adding options on it to start. But this is a absolutely trivial amount of effort. Realistically speaking, like there really isn't that much effort that went into this. Now, there is certainly time that goes into this. But you had to pay for it somehow. The returns aren't going to generate themselves as exactly as you're pointing out, right? That it's worth the effort. Because something is simple and trivial as this. It's a great starting point for somebody.

The way that I would do this is, like I was showing you before, I would continue this as is more or less. I would definitely add the price details for each of these. So rather than just the 10 month and the trailing 12 month, I would include like price and price, which you can also derive by the differences between these, by the way. But I would have that. And then I would have for each of these multiple explorations. So again, I would do the seven day, 30 so on. And then you'll see a trend relative to the different durations. The other kind of stuff that I would look at is picking different days of the week to do the rebalance instead of balancing every Friday. I would then maybe rebalance every third Friday or every second Friday or whatever. But this kind of thing is again, like the starting point to give you something to go off of.

That's just not going to work, like you have to understand with a better degree of certainty, like what you're attempting to extract and why it may or may not be there.

It's the stuff that's less flashy to people. And I'm really, really happy to be able to like bring it here, at least for a conversation and for exposure for you guys.

This is the kind of thing that I would get on to have something working that we understand that we know is robust while we go on different side quests to find other stuff that might be more lucrative. This is a good starting point. What we just did learned what edge was. We learned how to search SSRN and find something to at least begin exploring. And then we went through a practical example of how to explore it, at least at a very high cursory level. This is what it looks like.

Like another base question I would have is not following the random path here. But that's actually starting from the beginning of the year. We had a good experience to test something that had a moderate drawdown. That actually looked pretty rough. But if we go back and we cherry pick a period that does better. So if we go back to somewhere around here and we start in August and see how these performed relative from August, we likely will get another really usable piece of information. We'll do one of them really quick because I don't know why I like trading this much, but I'm always super like I enjoy it. And I don't know what we're going to find. I have an idea of what we're going to find. But I don't know to what magnitude. So let's go to the Friday and August. Actually, no, we've been doing it the end of the prior month. So that's fine.

So this gives us our 2025 performance let's go to 2024 and we're starting from to August 24. These two will be blank and let's see really quick. I've got to clear this data out. So SNP is above trailing 12 month return is 17.6%. EFA is next. This one is below. So it's no good trailing 12 is 6.2. ELT is above. Trailing 12 is 0.8. EBC is below. So nothing to do there. Trailing 12 is minus 9.8. B and Q is above. Trailing 12 is 7. So our pick here will obviously be V and Q and spy. So let's take a look at our same playbook. We'll go out to the 17 Jan.

And you got a little bit of a sample with the first iteration of them. But this will give you a slightly more direct version. So this one spot price is 55832 and the premium 4 hour 535s is 41. And then for VNQ. Let me even know if this one was profitable or not. For VNQ that one's at 9419. So that one's good. And we had the 91s. Those are now at 570. All right.

So you can see your overall performance to the upside is almost triple. Your performance to the downside was not insignificant, but that's what makes this a higher volatility strategy. That's the whole point of something like that. And again, this isn't optimized really in any way. We just kind of pitch a random expiration and a random delta to start with. The point that I want you to walk away with is the process that we did to find an idea and to begin testing the idea. That wraps me up for our latest trading basics series.
