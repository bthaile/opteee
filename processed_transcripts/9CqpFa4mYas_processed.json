So that's good. Is this thing working? Perfect. PFA, can you hear me? Making sure that we're alive and well, otherwise I can hotspot from the phone if I need to. Okay, perfect. Thank you, Lauren. Looks like everybody else was just playing games and gonna let me fucking sit here and figure it out on my own. So no thank you for whoever's doing that. Awesome. So first things first, I got to grab a couple links for us and we're gonna run through. We're gonna run through some more of DFVs kind of due diligence that we've seen, not just about DFV I guess, but just broader game stop due diligence. So I'm just grabbing a bunch of links right now so that we can float through them and take a peek together. So first let's just talk about GME though because I did a video yesterday on it and it looks. I mean, I love that it's consolidating up here. It opened, it had a high of 2980 low of 27, so it's like a really, really inside day here, but I don't even really think that matters that much. I think the fact that it's still hanging out up here and it's not necessarily being done on crazy",

As much support up here is it can get so we also got the John here, we got Dirt Shlup great to see you all. We had to start a little bit earlier tonight just because of some schedule and stuff. So thank you guys for being flexible popping on early. Let me grab our GME map to start because I got to make sure that we have this fully up to date with anybody that's. Die one in need to know where you're from or here's our GMU. So if you are dialing in, let me know where you're from. And in the meantime, while I'm starting to fill this in and whatnot. Okay, that water tastes weird. Do you like this water? It's fucking weird. So we have like this weird water from this hotel. It's supposed to be a BPA free liner, which I guess sounds good, but it tastes weird. Yeah, not a big fan. Cool. So let's take a look at this while we're waiting for anybody to chime in",

I think you might actually have a friend here. Yeah, you do. See? So we have almost it was you that told us previously. But we have we have attendance from Maui so far. So Sean, I don't know where in Maui you are with somebody else's from there too. So you could phone a friend, make a friend. We still need Madagascar. I don't know when your guys's travel plans are going to take you to Madagascar. But that's pretty high on the hit list for me. We already have New Zealand, which is sick. I also think what would be good is Tasmania. Because Tasmania just seems like a cool ass place. And then obviously we're still trying to get Iceland.

So there's going to be light off soon because investment bank is supposed to be grind until you die. And I'm looking at a bunch of empty desks right now. There's literally nobody there grinding. They got the lights on nobody's home. So yeah, I don't know what that's all about. And then we have some neighbors across the way that it looks like they're watching a cartoon. A cartoonist city living's not for me. I don't like being able to see this much shit. SAS has been watching for a while. Just curious, do you hold a long position in GameStop yourself? It yeah, so it's kind of ebbs and flows.

But yeah, GameStop is one of those stocks that has a ton of movement potential. And from pretty much any sort of trading perspective, that's a net positive because things that have more volatility, like you see here, you can trade things like the volatility in it, you can trade the price movements, all that kind of stuff. So it's like really, really interesting in that way because it'll grab trends and run a trend for a little while. And that's one of the things I try to talk to people about it's because it's not like GameStop is relegated to just its squeeze behavior. It definitely has squeeze behavior. There's no doubt about it. But that's not the only thing that it does. It has a lot of other price behavior that I genuinely find interesting. Because if we zoom this out a little bit further, come out to a year, you can trade this thing from a lot of different directions on short-term timeframes. So it can have these big massive runs, it can have contractions, it can have sideways periods for volatility, a lot of sideways periods. And the interesting thing about the sideways periods is that",

So it can have these big massive runs, it can have contractions, it can have sideways periods for volatility, a lot of sideways periods. And the interesting thing about the sideways periods is that you're kind of inventorying risk if you're trading it in more of a price neutral flavor, which is a lot of people do that with something like this because of how volatile it is. I measure the risk premiums and stuff pretty regularly. And it is pretty strong risk premiums that this continues to have. And anything that has big, outsized move potential like this, that's exactly what it's going to have. Because somebody is going to inventory the risk on the sell side. So in order for them to logically hold that position, they have to be compensated for that risk. But Donkey Kong says, will you be calling in air strikes on these locations? I don't think so. I don't think there's a need to. I think it's nice to be able to watch a couple different TVs right from where I'm sitting looking out the window.

I don't know if you guys know, but like if we take a look here, we're working for JP Morgan, JP Morgan, CEO salary. Let's see. See, this is the problem. There's really no way for the CEO, which is Jamie Diamond for those unaware. The CEO of JP Morgan, his base salary is a mill and a half. And then his performance based compensation is 34 and a half, which is five mill in cash and then the rest in equity, which is kind of ridiculous if you think about it. So in order for him to be able to take home his measly 36 million per year, he obviously needs the interns grinding away working right now, which they're not. So very much like that other video that we did, which was making sure everybody's aware of the plight of Citadel in Ken. Just keep do us all favor and keep Jamie Diamond in your thoughts and prayers as well, because obviously they're not working.

I still have conjecture that he has. I think that he has a yacht somewhere. Why wouldn't you when you have that much money? I don't see any reason to not hook yourself up with a yacht. It's kind of like the least to least you could do or at least you can get for your effort. I don't know how long he's been seeing for this kind of interesting. So what do you guys make of GameStop so far? I'm going to grab the library now and we need to get back through here. We were sorting this by date and I don't remember where we ended. Do you guys remember you guys told me that there was a couple. I think this one we looked at the diamond notebook. Yeah, we've we started",

There is what we would call an opportunity cost here capital. So if you have money sitting somewhere that's not doing anything, not saying that it is there isn't with game stop. I don't know what your position is. But if you have money that's not really active, then you definitely did like it can be earning a return somewhere else. So the opportunity cost to the capital. I actually think is an important consideration. But the other thing is a lot of people think in black or white, which I don't think you need to. Right. There's nothing. There's no rules that say that you can't have a position. That you scale down and use the money somewhere else and then still maintain some kind of position. If you are so inclined or if you think it's better to just completely vacate and move out, like that's also completely reasonable. But I would always keep in mind that in the world of trading, you kind of have to execute what's most logical for you is a trader and not get hung up on other components. Because it's too easy to get stock holding things that aren't doing what you want. And there is an opportunity cost for that without a doubt. Like this is how it",

So if you guys want to get a recap on like the options and stuff, because I'm going to be keeping a really, really close eye, well, I look at it every day, but I'm going to keep a really close eye of it looking into earnings. Because I want to see if there's any interesting positioning that starts to emerge from potential earnings. And then let me grab chat GPT. I guess here we can use perplexity. I don't know if perplexity or GPT is, let's try GPT. And let's see summarize this section. And let's see what it comes up with. And then I'll walk you guys through what it's telling us.",

And then all of a sudden it's going to somehow gain consciousness and then try to ruin all of this. So make sure that you have your microwaves ready so that you don't fall, fall victim to a robot that would be pretty lame, I think. So yeah, I think that that's a great point that this highlights.",

Yeah, you better start learning how to say, please, and thank you to chat GPT because chat GPT is going to be like the little cousin to the overlord soon that you're going to want to gain.

And then we can, but in the meantime, I'm just going to grab this and throw it into chat GPT for a summary and see any high level things that draw my interest. The reason why a lot of these I kind of bounce through is most of what these are talking about. I think most of us generally and already are aware of the case now some of these will have very deep nuance specific points, but I don't actually think necessarily that those deep specific nuance points change a whole lot. So I want to see at a high level what this one has for us and then we'll take a look from there. Because like this I'm looking at fines and I'm just assuming that they're not that they're highlighting that the fines are nowhere to mention it, which again, that's like one of those things that we kind of already know.

It's always a few day period that you get in order to position and to you know change your structure how you want.

Now I emphasize that point of perspective movement because literally nobody ever knows when something is going to do something. But what I can say is that I've looked back through the literally the entire history of GameStop at this point. And I've created a lot of different like data slices that analyze movements.

Then it goes to 1181 notice how much bigger the average daily ranges here that's something that we can use to predict larger price movement again even the most recent move it's not that significant but notice what happens. We are trending sideways this was around earnings so this will happen we're trending sideways trending sideways then all of a sudden before the move happens volume starts to scale. Now again it's not like a massive change but it is absolutely notable we can see it volume here was 2.68 and then it goes to 6 mil this is before we had the big move then we have on the 28th of October volume expand to 13.64 right so what I'm showing you is that even if you didn't bottom tick this which is a fools errand anyways in trading.

Break out so what that looks like is in this case let's say that we get in and it's trading around 21 and 3 quarters 21.74 and then we have our stop set at the the low for this day leading into it which is 20.73 right so you're essentially taking. One point risk you're taking such light risk so the nature of these is being stopped out very frequently and that's okay because when you get stopped out the tiny little losses and then when you don't get stopped out guess what it's a really healthy move so in this case we were risking a dollar give or take and let's again say we got in at 21.78 and now it's trading at 27.90 so we're going to get a stop at the end of the day. So you're risking a dollar to make six so it's again this is specifically for pfa to kind of consider and really for everybody else's consumption that there's a lot of ways that you can trade things like this as long as you remember that like your job is a trader is to be mobile right it's to pay attention to things as they move and take advantage of opportunities as they present itself going back to 21 guess what you're going to see.

So it's 28 million this essentially takes a move from this is 491 and then the range on the next day high to low was 966 to 501 right so then you essentially can get in at near term prices and then again depending on how you choose to play it follow the trend run your stops this is light years before the big move. So the idea that I find a lot of the ape community has it can found me because there's no reason to always maintain a perpetual position unless you want to if you want to that's cool do do whatever fits you best there's no issue with that at all but there's also when people say like molasses tomorrow or you know the big moves always tomorrow or the next day that's okay right like because there's still enough time as long as you're paying attention to",

And again, if your preference is to have kind of like that fundamental long game stop position just because you like it cool that makes sense but what I try to encourage people is to go into things what I call eyes wide open so there shouldn't be any you know there shouldn't be any component that you're not aware of with respect to the tradeoffs so if we're maintaining positive exposure to game stop in a perpetuity in an attempt to get the opportunity to win this game. And then to find a squeeze then the one thing you will solidify is that if there's a squeeze you will be in the trade so that's good right you can essentially create that profile for yourself but if you think that that's not potentially coming at the cost of capital being used otherwise that then can be pivoting pivoted over into game",

So I think that's a very short change in yourself. So food for thought as they says by 1 billion worth of Bitcoin that is something you can do I'm pretty sure Michael sailor is trying that approach right now as it sits so that Lawrence is right now so fine. I'm here holding my 5k portfolio up so I'm hanging out right now I'm hanging out for now well the problem with you Lauren besides the fact that you have a gregiously long legs apparently is if you if you aren't realizing profits on those traits and re allocating capital it's not really doing that much for you I wish I had my drawing pad with me I don't on on this setup unfortunately this would be a really helpful thing. Can I draw with it be really tough to draw I think.

So let's take a look at the example because we can gain entry somewhere down here then is it rallies up and it starts running we can essentially use the lows of the gap for another stop. I have to click it each time that's an eye. There it consolidates it consolidates then as it gets up here we would set a stop potentially yeah I've got to click it again we would set a stop potentially for a drop below here so on this kind of day we would get out and realize the profit that we've made so far you can either scale out entirely or you can scale out partially then when you get a break above I got to click this again when you get a break above this prior resistance",

So which is really good for for overall return profiles just for general awareness so now back to GameStop as it as it sits today I want to finish going through this next one really quick so that we can eyeball a few things we need to grab this again and then let's grab this. Okay so this is looking at part two of House of Cards so this says financial struggles in a small float of 50 million shares short sellers exploited this by taking short positions exceeding 140 of the flow which is crazy. The fact that you can have something that literally is over 100 of the float is not like exactly this right mathematically impossible just doesn't make sense it's absolutely absurd that that can be a thing but it is what it is. And then it draws the comparison which I think you guys have done a bunch of times comparing it to the Volkswagen Vd coming in for the Deutschland short squeeze which I guess in 08. Porsche reduced the available flow to 1 causing massive demand in GameStop short interest exceeded its entire float highlighting a deeper systemic problem. Yeah, naked short setting artificially increases share supply suppressing prices this one makes sense to everybody right like how this works because this is kind of an important important point and why people talk",

It's not something that can be dismissed it absolutely as part of this whole thing of course as my problem has been that I take profits to early profit is profit but I miss out on some larger gains I'm still so new to trade in that I don't view as that I don't mind I'm not. That I don't mind I view it more as experienced well anybody in the chat that's familiar with my channel and what I talk about can tell you exactly what you're dealing with there and it's because it is really really common you actually shouldn't be doing that at this point to be honest at least if you watch any of my content because you should be aware of that and the problem with it by now but if not let me grab a video I actually think that there's a video that I just like literally just put out today.

So this study here I literally reference it all the time for anybody that's into trading even if you're not a nerd like I am you can go on to publication like SSR and and you can just look up different kinds of studies that exist this one's really important because it looks it a really broad sample of investors which is different than trading and you can't be too pedantic with stock market style studies simply because there's not that many of them that are quality. And there's two names that you will see a lot you will see Barbara and O Dean both of those guys are are fantastic I've actually had the pleasure of talking to them a couple times on the phone just asking me general questions neither one of them wanted to do an interview but I try to have them on the podcast just because I really respect the work.

So number two is flag as sell winning investments while holding losing investments known as the disposition effect the reason why I highlight it here is because things that are this widely studied and this well understood they should not be mistakes that we make as traders because this is the same thing is somebody telling you that if you jump off a really high bridge you're likely to hurt yourself. Right like we don't need to do that mistake our self to understand that there could be a problem if we do it based on the artifacts of other people doing it and viewing the results. The in trading you cannot afford to make all of the mistakes by yourself it is if you're the kind of person that says like you know I have to touch the stove to figure it out you know that the stove's hot well trading is not going to work that well for you.

The reason why it's the wrong question is because the way you choose to take profits is completely completely and utterly dependent on what the strategy is you can't pick in our betrayer number it just doesn't work that way I actually recorded a video it comes out on the 14th of December and I'm going to say I'm going to take a look at the it's about using stops in trading so that's essentially how to how to select exit points and a big thing that you'll learn in that video is why picking exit points it cannot be random it can't be random and here's why if we go let me grab this really quick and I think that this might help drive this example and I'm happy to talk about it because this is a really really important concept for you guys and I actually think I",

Oh, I wanna read these case studies. It says ABN Amro repeated violations over eight years, including misreporting short interest in understating margin requirements. Interesting. These actions undermine market integrity but resulted in minor fines. So we already know, and this is one of the things that they were highlighting in that documentation from the due diligence, is that they are highlighting how small the fines were. APEX clearing over four years, they excluded 1.36 million shares from short interest reports across just two sample sentiment periods, suggesting widespread under reporting. Now, one of the things I'm curious about with these is other than the financial impact, did they do any research to objectively find out if there was nefarious activity? I know that we all assume that there is, but I'm curious if that was proven. Because I know that, again, I know that that's our underlying assumption, but I don't know if it's actually been proven in something. Let me see if I can find that APEX is a good example.

Without admitting or denying the findings, the firm consented to the sanctions into the entry of findings that it failed to comply with finisher interest reporting requirements and related supervision obligations, find and state it that the firm experienced an issue in its short interest reporting logic that excluded certain short interest positions from the firm submission of Fennora. Okay, so this is, they're trying to say that it was due to systems issues. So again, I'm sure that unless they were forced to be an investigation to actually, you know, to somebody else to figure out exactly what happened, I'm sure that they would lean on this. So what I derive from this is it's just inconclusive. We don't know if it's like legitimately purposely being done, we can make assumptions, but we don't know objectively. So yeah. Interesting. All right, let's go back to this. Yep, we know this. DTCC. Well, design and streamline settlements, systems has enabled manipulative practices like negative choice selling.

That's crazy. So this says they turn down the bed. Turning back the top covers and refreshing the linens. They tidy up the room. What the fuck? Leaving a small tree chocolate on the pillow or bedside table, closing the curtains and turning the lights so that they literally like put you to bed. That's fucking crazy. You know, people are nuts. Campy like that. Yeah, but I definitely think that this happens without a doubt because we, we see that with like the, the repeat instances of offenses in, in places like this. Interesting. MuleSpec says, is this an episode of Beverly Hill buildings? Apparently, I'm going to tell you guys. I don't know anything about this shit. I literally did not know what that was. It's, I, yeah, it, that's a very strange thing to me. I don't know why anybody would want that. Says fucking bizarre. Mashton says, turn on services, the practice of staff entering a guest room and turning down the bed. Linen of bed. Yeah, it's like crazy. Like just, just fucking get in the bed yourself like a grown adult. WTDC says, it's a long time for me on this stuff. But there could be a Lehman rep on the DTCC board if the underwriter allows",

It's like the bigger you are, the more you're on here, Deutsche Bank, Goldman. So it's like, but again, this is one of the things to keep in mind is that I, I don't necessarily think like every single instance of this is nefarious activity. Like I, I generally do think with bigger companies like this, they're going to have issues oversight problems. Like that's natural. But for a lot of it to be so focal on this is sus to me. And I think that there's no way that most of them don't know what they're doing with respect to like the naked shorting. Like that's, that's an active choice. So yeah, crazy. All right.

Yeah, okay, perfect. This works great. So now we know how to find our spot easily. The Johnson's MSTR we could take a look at that another day. I try to keep these a little more game stop focused. So happy to take a look at that either tomorrow or on Monday or Tuesday or something. Unclothed Salamander Sandwich. That's hilarious. Could Jamie bone cone at 35? Let's take a look at the probabilities on that real fast. And we can we can know with certainty. Is this where? Is this where it is? I think it should be in here. It's not. It was a little bit. So yeah, let's grab GameStopup here real fast. Kill this. So if we peak at GameStop's current state, 35 is right there. My instinct would say 35 is very unlikely. Unless there's a very specific catalyst. The reason why I think 35 is unlikely is because this move. And I actually think it's a good thing that it's unlikely to be clear.",

The reason why I think 35 is unlikely is because this move. And I actually think it's a good thing that it's unlikely to be clear. Because this move has been very orderly. It's been moving in really nice phases. It's seeing good movement on volume, volume variance, moving averages are starting to look really, really good. So my guess, best guess is that we would see GameStop probably hover like this. In that range, leading into earnings, that would be my guess, kind of this range. And the reason for that is most companies will start to slow down as it gets closer to earnings, which is on the fourth. So maybe it's still us two weeks. So maybe it could be a little more active before. But the probability of this hitting 35, I imagine is going to be pretty low. Let's see. So the probability of a touch at 35. Yeah, I stand corrected. This is showing like a 50 chance, 51 chance actually. So slight edge, bigger chance than I thought. So obviously these options have a lot of volatility in them more than actual. Yeah, so they do stop. I was wondering because when I literally just looked at this yesterday, the, the, the ball itself wasn't this heavy. So yeah, this makes, this makes a lot more sense now. I",
