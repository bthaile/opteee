    "text": "Another uncomfortable truth about trading. I've been doing this for now 18 years. That's fortunate. I started really early. So I've made a lot of these mistakes. I had a lot of these misconceptions. And one of them is that the market doesn't give a fuck about you. It does not care how much you need the money. It does not care how hard you work. It does not care about anything about you. It's indifferent to you. That's actually a great thing. Because it's indifferent to you. If you can learn to interact with something that isn't going to give you any extra help when you need it or try to hurt you in any specific way, the market is just going to do what the market does. And if you can learn to work with that, you're going to be so much better off. So the markets indifferent to you. Get over it. You can now move on to how to interact with the system that doesn't care about you. Be an otler or see a later.",
