    "text": "What is up to all the outliers. Happy Friday today is the 6th of May. And I have a video for you on trading the covered strangle in bear markets. Because one looks like it might be looming right around the corner. We're in a pretty deep correction right now. And it's not looking good. So figured quite timely to do this video. But on a real note, I did get a couple questions about the strategy. And I have a video out on how I traded it during the COVID market. And I ended up walking away at a pretty clean profit. Despite the fact that the trade was completely directionally wrong. So let's take a look at the screen and dive right in. I want to cover a handful of things. The first thing is I'm going to overview a little bit about that COVID trade, how it went. And then I want to walk you guys through a handful of things that I think are what sets the strategy apart. So as I have a structure that really enables me to trade it this way. Because it's not a bearish strategy. So I want that to be abundantly clear up front. If I knew we were going into some sort of bear market, I would not load up on positions to enter into a covered strangle. And I would say that I'm not going to load up on a neutral to bullish strategy. But the highlight here",

But the main thing is we don't know when a bear market is going to come. So if your goal is to try to perfectly time the markets to the upside and the downside. That is an approach. The way that I attempt to make most of my money is through money management. And this is the heart and soul of this position. So down at the bottom is actually an excerpt from the video that I made trading the COVID drop. I'll throw a link to that up here in case you want to check it out. But essentially I had an existing position from over here. And then this is when the trade really started. But you'll notice a few things. And then I started in here. There's a series of adjustments that occur. And then this is where I exited the trade at a profit. I want to highlight a very important thing. This is where I started trading it, which was around just shy of what 120 something like that. Right around 120. And then down here",

And then I made that, I managed money in the trade. Sorry, I just realized that it's closer to 170 here. And I got out in the 120s. That's what I was thinking about. So let's talk about how I did this and how it worked out. Because in this example, I was able to essentially walk out of the trade in this specific trade. I made 36,000. And it's nothing to write home about. However, against being able to make that on a trade that is not for bearish markets is where the true power of the strategy comes in. So the very first thing is again, it's not ideal. I wouldn't seek to trade the coverage strangle through bear markets. But because we I am not good at timing them. I typically continually deploy the coverage strangle. And this is a big reason why I choose to allocate my portfolio, how I do. So I have a video on that as well. How I like to allocate my portfolio.

And that's an extremely important aspect of this overall discussion. But for a cliff notes on the allocation idea, I split my portfolio into a core holding and speculative holding. And the core holding is really where I primarily trade the coverage strangle. This is where I'm going to try to make the vast majority of my annual returns. And then the idea for the speculative allocation. It's to take advantage of current market trends. It's a little more directional, a little more risky. Now, I have very strict rules about how much of my account I will use when the market is trading at different levels. So for example, in the core allocation of my portfolio, when we were when I'm trading the coverage strangle in something that's near all time highs, I tend to pull in my initial offering for that trade. And I try to limit the amount of risk I'm offering the market. Depending on the overall condition of the market, but I'm a little more careful near highs because obviously we have a little more room to go to the downside. Especially when the market has a lot of conditions that are tied into it. If we're near highs during a trending bull market, I'll still be careful with allocation, but less so than when",

I've been maintaining a fairly light allocation throughout the year. I still look to make what I need to make in order to support my annual target. However, I think the market is pretty tenuous. So I'm not necessarily offering a ton of risk to the market. So let's talk about trading a plan. I have plenty of videos out there on the coverage strangle. And as you guess, I can link to one of them up above here that outlines it pretty well. So I'm not going to go super far in detail on all the facets of the strategy. You can check that video out, but I want to hand I want to highlight a handful of things that were pivotal throughout the life cycle of this trade. The very first one is maintaining cash reserves. I started alluding to that already with how much risk I tend to offer the market.

The other thing is when I perceive that we are in more volatile and potentially bearish markets, I add to the trade less readily. So one of the things you'll see here is rolling to manage basis. That's one of my favorite things to do with the coverage strangle. I can choose to roll the trade out and not adjust my size and ideally still reduce my strike, which reduces my overall risk. And that's a great strategy. Sometimes when the market moves too fast, you can't do that without adding size to the account. When the market is in a precipitous down move like this, I seek to add size to make the most meaningful changes to my basis, but I think of them as silver bullets. You don't have unlimited number of them, and you can only size into a trade so much before either you're at the point of throwing a bunch of good money after a bad trade, or you just run out of money. So with that, I am very careful how I choose to scale into the trade as it's going down. So in this example, I was waiting until 10 down moves before I would scale into the trade more. And that was really important for me to maintain capital throughout the life cycle of this trade,",

And that was really important for me to maintain capital throughout the life cycle of this trade, because in this video I did here, that was just one example of one trade that I was working on. I had other positions in the entire portfolio, and that's actually why towards the end of it, I started becoming levered because I had other positions on the portfolio. But for this one trade alone, I'm very careful about how I add risk. The next thing is the long haul. The average bear market is around 290 to 300 days. I think it's 298 or 299. And with that, you kind of have to buckle up for the long haul. And what that means is, again, if you scale in with all of your money on this initial drop here, you're kind of screwed. You're kind of just sitting on the sidelines. You can take assignment and wait, which is part of this whole long haul concept. But I try to make sure that I experience most of the down move while maintaining capital so that I can maintain price sensitivity. Because as we're adding additional risk to the trade, it is cost averaging us in as we take assignment or if we're using it to adjust our short put",

And it's a way to manage the overall risk in the trade. However, again, if you scale into fast, that's why I use something like 10 down moves. You run into a tough spot where you run out of money and then you're stuck just sitting on your hands, which leads to the next point though. Sometimes sitting on your hands and doing nothing is the best possible approach. And it's exactly why I'm so careful about the products that I will trade the coverage strangle because one of the primary management approaches to the coverage strangle is taking shares in a K being assigned. That's why I trade things like I WM the spy the cues, I trade things that if I get assigned, I am truly comfortable holding them for the long term. I offer this point of consideration to you. If you sell short puts on something like GE and it goes through a horrible down move, there are occurrences where even a blue chip stock does not return to its predry. It can have that big of a structural change. I have never seen an index ETF like spy I WM or cues fall down",

I have never seen an index ETF like spy I WM or cues fall down and not at some point in the future reach and subsequently surpass the previous highs that it fell from. That is why I like to trade index ETFs for this because when I say sometimes sitting and holding is part of the strategy, you have to be confident in what you're holding and this is exactly why I prefer index ETFs in this scenario. I would not do this with individual stocks, even if it's a blue chip stock that I really, really believe in because there's simply too much risk in my opinion, even giants can fall and I'm not willing to bet my entire net worth on an individual stock falling. I am, however, much more confident betting a significant chunk of my entire net worth on the broader market and the broader market returning because again, it hasn't failed so far. Sometimes you've had weight a little while, but it comes back. The other thing I want to highlight here is risk inflow outflow. So as I'm talking about scaling into the trade, that's what you're seeing here. So from S1 to S1, I'm maintaining size, then from S1 to S2, I'm adding size, then from S2",

Now, as we start getting a little bit of accommodation in the market, you'll see that it goes back down to S3, back down to S2, back down to S1. These are instances where I'm actually reducing size. So I am very eager during this kind of market to offer risk and take risk off the table to reduce the overall profile I'm offering to the market because you have to remember during this entire portion of the trade, we are managing a loss. The trade is not working in our favor. We are simply trying to make money back so that we're not stuck holding an unrealized loss for an extended period of time. So that's why you'll see me start to take risk off. It's the same thing this past week on the 4th of May. After the Fed announcement, we got that bit of a bounce. I took some of my short puts off of IWM, and I'm glad I did that because the rest of the week they were down, they would be underwater right now by like 9. So during tenuous markets during choppy",

So during tenuous markets during choppy volatile markets, if I'm starting to scale in in a big way, I am going to be looking for opportunities to get out of the trade at a scratch or a small profit so that I can get the risk off the table. And it increases my subsequent sensitivity to the trade if we do have a true bear market that again lasts much longer than the three day bear market we experienced during IWM, that kind of thing. Alright, next one, accepting red, I'm not going to spend too much time on this. It's kind of self explanatory, but it is important to note, there is a psychological effect of every single day opening up the platform, seeing an unrealized loss, especially if it continues to grow. If you haven't experienced that yet, do not think that you know how you will react because you don't we don't really have a great idea of how we're reacting that scenario until we start to experience it. Most people get scared, they get shaken out, and then they exit at the worst possible times. So it is just important to acknowledge that that exists, perhaps test a couple of your strategies",

And the vast majority of people again will think that they're comfortable holding the product until it falls by 40 in value, 50 in value, then all of a sudden they're not comfortable anymore, although they said they were originally. So there's nothing wrong with changing your disposition or changing, you know, the way you're managing the trade based on new information as it comes in, but it's just important to know that this is an extremely, extremely common trend for people. And again, this is why I like to trade index ETFs because this is it reduces this factor almost 100 fold for me. If I'm trading individual stocks, there is always the potential for it to die. However, I've not seen it happen with a broad market index yet. So that is exactly why I use that strategy to help me manage those emotions.

Okay, last thing I want to talk about is again, that portfolio management approach already explain how I break out my portfolio. The important thing to know here is by managing the allocation though between these two. What happens is it allows me to still deploy this speculative allocation of my portfolio to benefit from the current market circumstances. So when we started in this really big decline, I started adding bearish strategies in the speculative holdings. The reason I do this is it helps me to manage the overall risk of the entire portfolio. And even though I'm managing big losing trades on the core side, I'm able to engage the market effectively with the speculative side maintaining more sensitivity to current pricing. By structuring the portfolio in this way, you are still able to engage with the market and you're not stuck sitting on the sidelines. However, the only way you get to this is if you plan for this ahead of time and you leave enough money to be able to trade the side of the account still.

It is a neutral to bullish strategy, but it can survive bear markets. And again, in this exact scenario, it allowed me to exit the overall position far earlier than I would have if I didn't do this. I got hung up at around 170 basis here. I was able to get out at around a high 120 low 130 basis. So there's a 40 point move that I didn't have to participate in or wait for in order to get out of this thing as a profit. That is why I love this strategy so much. And if you structure it carefully, it can do you pretty damn well. So if you enjoy this content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, like the video, throw in the comments.
