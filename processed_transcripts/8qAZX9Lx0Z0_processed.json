    "text": "what's up to all the outliers eric here i got a video for you today on the ratio diagonal option strategy that i run very frequently you will also hear me refer to it as the call leaps diagonal because i do trade it to the call side more often than the put side and leaps are very commonly a part of the equation but not always so i have a series that's actually really in depth on this my goal for this video is to provide a 65 to 70 level of depth overview however in one video so i'm looking to pack a lot of information into this one video so it's easier for people to find the strategy because it is one of my favorites so let's do a quick overview of what is a diagonal in general and then what is the ratio diagonal so in short a diagonal is very very similar to a covered call and the main difference is instead of using long stock you use long calls that's pretty much it so it's also still similar to a calendar in that it's typically across different expirations however it's different than a calendar because it's not typically at the same strike for the long call to short call so quick synopsis the ratio diagonal has two parts a long call and a short call typically the long call will be further out in time the short call will be nearer in time although",
