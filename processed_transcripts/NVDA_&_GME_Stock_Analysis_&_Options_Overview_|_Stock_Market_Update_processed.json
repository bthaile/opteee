    "text": "the 6p my guess is these are kind of earnings shots of some sort I don't honestly know why you would buy calls into earnings here because typically V will tend to contract but again in this case my expectation is V will continue to expand actually pretty meaningfully so this could be somebody that's playing a little bit of a directional disposition but then also trying to play play an expansion in IV because 63 12 Vols for this is is light I think and there's a good chance that the Vols in here will expand even if the option itself doesn't move that much the other thing you can't help but find 1069 just a fun number I suppose now I does look like unusual Wales is combining that with a couple other orders here because they take them up to 2,000 and I can see a couple other transactions going through for the six app right so I can see a Trona 350 come through here and stuff like that so there's a chance this could be somebody hitting it repeat actually we can check that really fast this one came through 57 so this is Pacific Time by the way so let me scroll down to 1057 and see if we can find a couple other transactions yeah in here yeah so it looks like that person built up and it looks like they gave them all of these here but that still is a little",
