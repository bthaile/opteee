    "text": "I love me a good anomaly in the options market and what better than GameStop we have a really interesting position today and even if you're not necessarily a big GameStop person there's some really important details in here for options Traders RIT large there's a great lesson so today in the 19 July 24 expiration cycle the 30 calls they had pretty high volume and they actually kicked off a couple different alerts that I have except this one was really weird let me show you why if we first start with what is a bid what is an ask the bid is the most somebody is willing to buy something for right now and then the ask is the cheapest somebody is willing to sell for right now so that means that if I want to buy something as a Trader you have to essentially be near the ask to do it right now right the second you can always try to play the mid price that's more of a negotiation process of back and forth typically so if I want to buy something right now this second and get a fill you got to go towards the ask if I want to sell something right now I would have to go towards the bid so what's going on here well this I was looking at the 30s a lot of lot of transactions today and this is filtering by stuff that's 50 lots and over there's way",

    "text": "49 taken at 50 very weird I do not know but like I said Instinct I think buy based on the rest of the volume today based on the data I would have to lean towards a sale again leaning primarily on the size offered here matching perfect here so I will have a better answer tomorrow for sure because I will download all of the trades from today and I'll see what size they came through and what the market was offered at that time so yeah again personal little pet project that really doesn't impact much of anything but I do find very very interesting and if these were buys this is a very interesting position because this is out for the next primary expiration at the 30s it's a big position so TBD we'll see if you have any question let me know be an outlier see you guys later",
