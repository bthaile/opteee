Yeah, there we go. Good. So first off, you know, welcome to the channel. We had a chance just to talk for a few minutes, you know, get generally acquainted. I'm really looking forward to your perspective here. So when you see me looking down, it's because I have my handy dandy notebook, because I'm Polish and I can't remember things from questions. I'm 69 and I can't remember things. But realistically, I think one of the really fun parts of my YouTube channel is just connecting with people like you with a very different background, something that I know very, very little about. And I'm really excited to dive into that. So first off, thank you so much for coming on and chatting for a while. It's certainly my pleasure and thank you for your service. I can see the marine thing on the back wall there. That's right. Yeah, a lot of people are like, what is all that crap on your walks? I got like knives, ale horns. I got a Tomahawk all sorts of little dude dads hung up my wife loves it. Let me tell you. You probably know how to use them. So I figure, you know, always helpful to start with a bit of background.

So I figure, you know, always helpful to start with a bit of background. And what led me to you is I was looking through just Twitter and your name popped up. And I was looking through a page a little bit and I was like, oh, okay, this is like just a couple of things lined up that really peak my interest. And basically the money manager background that you have is always of interest just because it's such a different world than retail trading. Maybe not, you know, completely disparate, but I'm sure you could share a little more about that in a little bit. But then the other thing was, you know, the part about like futures and currency trading still, you know, we were talking a little bit about hogs and lumber. And I was like, to me, that's actually really interesting that you have that money manager background, obviously still very active as a trader. So first off, I would love to just get a, you know, quick synopsis of how you got started in the markets. And what did that look like for you? It was a chemical engineer out of Clarkson University up in northern New York. This is back in 1974 at the end of a 50 down",

It was a chemical engineer out of Clarkson University up in northern New York. This is back in 1974 at the end of a 50 down market on the SP. So I'm making 12,000 a year and in those days 12,000 a year was a lot of money. And so I start sucking money into a stock account and a bunch of us engineers would sit around at lunch and talk about investments and what newsletters we were reading and what their brokers told us and sharing ideas and eventually led to an investment club of some sort. And another guy and myself started practically managing it. De facto because nobody else in the club really could had any energy to do anything. So little by little, we took over that and had had a raise a bunch of money and then we hooked up on the third guy and that ended up forming a firm, investment advisory firm, which we ran part time for about three years or so while we were still working is during the day as chemical engineers. And one thing led to another pretty soon we have enough money under management we can afford my salary outside of the chemical company.

I think around 28 years or so and we expanded into all sorts of areas, currencies futures mutual fun timing we did a little stocks in the early going even traded some treasury bonds along the way when we had to do use the treasury bonds for collateral against the futures transactions. The laws have evolved over the years and things that can happen today. I mean literally didn't exist back then. Right. You would have really been inventing the wheel. You would have just been all by yourself and probably never raise a dollar. So I tried to stay with what I knew could be interesting to clients, but then you mentioned in your questions.

It's like they didn't know what to expect they it's like the sort of they didn't mind having currencies and it wasn't like there was a lot of losses.

Right and here I play you around and it's gorgeous. This is all heaven so for me as a golfer this is like the place to live and then I thought to myself while this is probably where I'd end up retiring anyway. So I might as well move the company while I have the energy and the money and everything else to do it. It cost me a quarter of a million dollars to move the company here overnight that we had airborne express we had 40 computers to move we had rock collections we had a boat that we moved.

But by 3rd by 2st day afternoon even Monday we needed to be up and running right preferably Sunday because the currency markets were going to be open in some places of the world on Monday. Guess what Britain doesn't celebrate the 4th of July think about it. So there's places that are open so we had to be operational and we are operational by completely by Sunday morning.

So you started with stocks and then what what happened what. Here's here's the mental process and. It's a very interesting one to me because I have evolved over what 50 years or so now. And it goes like this if you start out in stocks and you're just buying long. In the back of your mind you're thinking you know especially me because I came out in 73 74 I just saw when I was junior senior or college I'm tracking stocks to see what companies that I consider and going to look like financially because I'd like to go to a company that was doing real well.

I'm going to really lose a lot of money value of my account wouldn't it be nice to have something that could make money during that period. To at least diversify myself and offset some of it. And that got me thinking about futures because commodities because back in those days you could trade say a corn contract it didn't cost you that much. And I thought to myself well corn probably doesn't really care what the stock market's doing today right and stock market runs and really care what corn is doing today. So there's two things that could do their own thing.

And I've been trading futures for a while now but I find it really interesting that you even stumbled into them because what like what year was it when you started like working with with futures probably 1976 which I actually I'm not familiar do you know when futures were like launched like on actual exchanges I know they've been around forever. But yeah there's different I mean now there's I don't know 75 to 100 futures readily get to around the world electronically especially back in those days you know there was maybe 20 25 markets got it that were deep enough and everything was traded by hands so basically I would call a commodity broker commodity broker would write a ticket up by hand.

So even like YouTube and stuff like that wasn't huge then it existed but it wasn't huge with that data how did you even come across futures let alone like get to the level of proficiency where you know you're running 60 different trades at once with it. The first trade I did I remember was in corn and I had no idea what I was doing and I started with 600 and immediately went to 400 and then I closed it and I said what happened. And so I had to figure it out little by little you know talking to the broker reading a few books nothing comes to mind as being significant but just figuring out the math of it. And then I guess the profound moment for me was to sit there with if you remember point and figure charts they're still available on some platforms hardly anybody uses them anymore back in the day when you didn't have computers you had little cards on the floor so they put X's up and zeros down or owes down and they could track. They could track a lot of price information on a small card and they card could fit in their pocket",

And then one thing led to another and I started realizing that just trend following was an easy way to pick up all of those trades 10 out of 10. Right. Don't filter it too much try to get in on every one of those big trades because they pay for a whole lot of losses. Right. That's interesting. So do you think that like the cyclicality of futures was part of that analysis you were kind of because of like when you when you first start trading something like corn you know we may not think about the harvest season or the planting season you know what I mean stuff like that.

I could be cleaning up over in the future side and you know life's good just keep going. stocks are down and futures get up, the futures get a little more dominant. My math would have me taking money from futures and moving it over into my stock portfolio. So now I'm buying stocks cheap with the extra money I've made over in futures. That protects my drawdown coming up in futures that sooner or later is going to happen. It gets me some cheap prices over in stocks and now that goes crazy and maybe futures is struggling and again the other way it turns around and",

    "text": "money I've made over in futures. That protects my drawdown coming up in futures that sooner or later is going to happen. It gets me some cheap prices over in stocks and now that goes crazy and maybe futures is struggling and again the other way it turns around and it takes money from the stocks I put it over in futures. I keep balancing and rebalancing and rebalancing and it improves your return to risk ratios and at this stage that's all I try to go for. It's very high return to risk ratios. I like to get to little or no drawdowns I haven't got there yet but I keep working at it because then your denominator the risk side gets to close to zero and your return to risk gets close to infinity. That's a high comfort level for most people and certainly for a guy like me in retirement it's perfect. I'd rather not have a lot of violent moves. Sometimes it's unavoidable. I mean if crude oil one day is going negative like it did last year is I'm short there's not much you can do about it you just have to kind of enjoy that ride and then deal with whatever comes out of it typically a lot of brokers close those positions for you when you wanted to have them or not but it was at a nice profit so yeah and I just put the position on for the next month so",
