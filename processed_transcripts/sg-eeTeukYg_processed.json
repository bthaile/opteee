    "text": "I own a trading firm and operating. And how much did you make prior that you make this past year? Oh, you don't want to know. Down about three and a half million dollars. You've sent these in. These are fun to look at. So this guy's interesting. There's two things I want to point out. One, we're missing all context. We don't know that assets under management. So he said he's down three and a half million. But what does that mean as a percentage? Is he down 50, 80, 10, that matters a lot when we're assessing a hedge fund. The second thing is, there it is. He's just a dude. He's running a hedge fund. He has money. But he's still not doing well this year. There are plenty of retail traders that are up this year. Not saying that that means retail is better than hedge funds. But more often than not, you can just find your way into an index ETF passively invest in outperform these people without paying their fees, being outlier see all later.",
