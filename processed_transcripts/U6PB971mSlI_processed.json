    "text": "I started trading options back in 2007 while I was in high school and it's the primary way that I built my original layer of wealth. The goal of this video is to walk you through how I trade options. The idea is to kind of pull together all these different concepts into one place to give you some ideas because what I do doesn't really matter to you, but hopefully you can gain some different ideas and inspirations from some of the things that I do and maybe bake it into your process, have better results going forward. So you'll notice on the left hand side, we have some guiding concepts called what I pursue right hand side gets a little deeper into my actual approach. Let's start on the left hand side with the guiding concepts process driven. What does this mean? Well, when I first started trading, the vast majority of what I did really had me focusing on the outcome of a single trade. That sounds kind of important, doesn't it? Why wouldn't I emphasize the outcome of a single trade? Well, it's because I noticed that there was a propensity for me to start doing a lot of things that disagreed with my plan, trying to salvage the individual trade. And then I started noticing that I would deviate from the plan way more frequently, trying to salvage other trades. Then I noticed that essentially I wasn't doing anything related to the plan and I",

And then I started noticing that I would deviate from the plan way more frequently, trying to salvage other trades. Then I noticed that essentially I wasn't doing anything related to the plan and I had nothing to lean on to figure out what I was doing wrong because I was just doing whatever I wanted. So the idea behind process driven is that my goal is to create something that's repeatable for the long run. One of the biggest mistakes I made as an early trader and I imagine seeing with a lot of other people is I had the idea that I was going to turn my 5,000 account, 3,000 account, 15,000 account into my future wealth. Reality is that's not going to happen for the vast majority of people. It's going to take a lot of saving more money, making more money by achieving better jobs while you're saving more. And in third lever you can pull is getting better at trading. So in this scenario, by focusing on the individual trade outcomes, I'm sitting here trying to put the cart in front of the horse thinking, well, if I can just get a bunch of money really fast on these trades, I'll be set. And it's a really naive perspective. It doesn't bear out. So the main thing I remind myself is that everything I do feeds a process that I",

So the main thing I remind myself is that everything I do feeds a process that I should be able to execute. Not over the next week, month, year, five years, 10 years, literally over several decades is the idea. And that leads to what you see down here. Number five is robustness. What I do needs to make sense, not just today, not just in the current market environment, but how can I create an approach that allows me to stay up to date with what the market's doing? Because for example, if we take a look at a chart and we go back, let's check out SPX. And then let's go back like five years. You'll notice that SPX over the last five years has done different things. It had this really steep decline during COVID and stimulus checks came out, started skyrocketing back up, came back down, went sideways for a little bit, and then started grinding back up. So if you develop an approach that does well here and only here, it lacks robustness. It means that you don't have this skill set to trade this kind of environment, or this kind of environment, or maybe a slower drift up. And the idea is to be able to trade all of those conditions.",

Because over your trading career, you'll see many different conditions. So process driven, we want to be focusing on how am I building something that stands the test of time that I can continually optimize over time, worrying less about the individual trades, worrying more how each individual trade fits into a broader system, accepting the fact that that's going to include losing positions, and that's entirely okay. The second point here is strong convictions loosely held. So when I first started trading, I would kind of go after whatever I heard sounded good at the time. And again, highly naive approach. Because when you're first starting out, you don't have the depth of experience to kind of intuition your way through what may or may not make sense. So then you just kind of start doing it for a little bit, and then abandon it when it's not working periodically. You don't really have anything to show for it.

So great example is actually this past year in rut, the Russell. And this past year, if I pull this out year to date, when the year started, I was positioned long Russell. And the reason for that is because we were coming out of this really high rate environment, and the market was starting to forecast cuts as early as March. I knew that that was going to be front-rand by the market. I didn't want to miss the opportunity there. So I'm positioning myself long, I wait a month, and not much is happening. Right? So if we look here at the end of January, compared to the beginning, we just did not do much. And I was like, hmm, okay, this is taking a little bit longer rate environments changing. It's getting pushed out. Maybe I need to give it a little bit longer. Instead of March, now it's looking like kind of middle year. Okay, fine. I wait another month. So the end of January takes us to the end of February. I start to see some movement, but if you look at this in context, it's not much. The market opened over here",

I start to see some movement, but if you look at this in context, it's not much. The market opened over here at like 2010, and towards the end of February, it hit like less than 2100, so it just didn't move that much. So I started repositioning my portfolio, because even though I believed that when the rate environment was going to change, that we would see small caps move, that's what I believe, that was the thesis. It wasn't happening. So the strong conviction was in that thesis, loosely held, was as soon as it wasn't doing what I thought it should do in a reasonable amount of time, it was time to do something else. And that's when I rotate into things like the NASDAQ, which was actually starting to move really strong. It doesn't look like it because it looks flatter here, but that's because of the magnitude of the moves. It started the year at like 16604, and then by March-ish, it was at 18350. So it already had made fair move in the same time frame, and realistically what I was starting to pivot into was T-Tropocuse. And that's because it's essentially slightly magnified version of this showing a lot of strength. So that's the idea behind Bayesian analysis, is I want to formulate a really",

So that's the idea behind Bayesian analysis, is I want to formulate a really well thought out perspective that's based on data that I can objectively analyze, but then I want to be sensitive to new information. Hard and soft quantifiable edge. What this means is I want to have different modalities to make money, and you'll see that over here a little bit more in detail when we get to this section. But to give you an example of hard edge versus soft edge, very simple. If we take a look at something like the Russell, when it started making this breakout move, I traded this breakout, and then I followed it up. This was based on momentum that brought our thesis, but all of that boils down to stuff that I was able to quantify research around, but it's still very discretionary. I had the same thesis here, and it didn't work, right? So here it did. It's a discretionary trade, because I'm front running a move, hopefully with the rest of the market. But this is something that takes a ton of different experiences together in my mind as I'm creating this idea, it's discretionary in nature.

Meanwhile, for an idea of a hard edge, if we take a look at Apple, and we take a look at its earnings, we look through Apple's earnings out of the past eight earnings here, six of them, the implied volatility was higher than the realized or historical volatility here, here, here, here, here, here, and here. What am I showing you? This is a long-standing market function where implied volatility leading into earnings tends to be overstated compared to realized volatility. This is not unique to Apple, this is across earnings in general, this is a known phenomenon. That is a hard edge. It's something everybody knows exists, and it's there anyways, for a bunch of different reasons that I'm not going to get into in this video, but it's not really discretionary. I'm essentially just running an analysis based on a persistent trend and trying to trade that. So a completely different profit mechanism baked in here. Combined analysis simply means I'm going to use all data points that are relevant to what I'm doing. So I'm not a fundamental analyst, I'm not a technical analyst, I'm a whatever analyst.

In this position, I had the thesis I had that was baked on a lot of fundamental concepts, high inflation, depression of small caps due to that, those kinds of things. There's a lot of fundamental components to that. From a technical perspective, I'm using that to lock in my timing. So even though I still had the thesis here, from a technical perspective, it was not lining up. So then I need to do something else. But that combines both fundamental and technical analysis into a cohesive picture. I'm essentially going to wait the fundamental and technical analysis differently based on what I'm trading. Rebusiness, we already hit. 1 growth sustained is simple. The devil is in the details and it can take you really far in trading. And I give you this example down here. This is looking at a hypothetical scenario over 30 years where we start with 25,000 and we save 1.5,000 per month. At 15 return versus 16 return, 1 variance at the end of that leads to a 2.2 million variance. I care about the difference between 15 and 16 because I care about 2.2 million over that time frame.

You can't really see what's going on here, but that's the nature of compounding returns. They take time to display themselves. But then notice once you get over here towards year 30, look at the gap between these as it's opening up. This just becomes parabolic from there. I care about that 1, that 1 difference is a lot of fucking money. I care about that. So should you. The last thing here is skeptical optimism. In the finance world, you notice that there's no shortage of complete and utter bullshit. But I still remain open to information just about all of it. There is a heavy screening process that data goes through as I'm receiving it. I think it's done me really well, remaining very open to new data, but being highly skeptical in how I analyze it, see how quantifiable it is, see how rigorous the origin of the thesis is.

And as soon as you get to the point where you don't want to change anything, you're going to start falling behind. All right, let's talk about the approach. I take a very top-down approach. I start with the economy. Then I'll look at the market, the indices, sectors, subsectors. I want to understand from a broad picture how things are moving. Why? What are the primary themes? So right now, the primary themes are still high inflation. It's getting fairly persistent. The economy is still fairly strong, but slowing in some instances. And we're seeing things like AI still being very interesting, although it's now just starting to wane a little bit in this next earning cycle. So there's a lot of interesting things that you can kind of devise just from that. So, based on these two inputs, I'm going to come up with a disposition. How do I feel about things? What do I think makes sense for the portfolio that I want to construct based on this information? Then I'm going to build a portfolio around it and make sure that each individual position in the portfolio supports this disposition collectively. So even though, for example, let's say that I'm bullish in tech. Does that",

And I want to make sure I integrate that into what I'm doing. This is really important for options traders. Number two, this idea that profit mechanisms come first, then we fit a strategy. All this means is I'm not going to look at the market and say, hey, where can I put on a vertical spread? Where can I put on a ratio diagonal? I don't really care so much about what structure or strategy I'm using. What I care about is what opportunity am I trying to capture? And then what strategy fits it the best. So the cliff notes version of this is if I want to trade something bullish, the profit mechanism is bullish, something going up in value. That's what matters. Then if I choose to buy a call, sell a put, that's just an expression of what fits the portfolio best. They both make money in the same scenario.

So how to derivatives specifically options fit into my life. Well, I use both long and short premium strategies, not wedded to either or I actually think they both have a use case. So I don't limit myself to being in theta ganger or somebody that's just trying to buy yolo options. I do everything. I generally use undefined risk structures. So I'm not spreading things off with verticals more often than not. And I simply manage the risk of the positions. So rather than putting on a vertical spread and then just letting it go, I might sell a put or buy a call. And then if it's not doing what I want, I'll manage the trade in the middle as compared to just letting it go. What I'm trying to do here is reduce the friction of what I'm putting on. When I'm trading directionally with options, I'm looking for leverage.

So I don't go into this thinking, oh, I only want to trade, you know, 90 day options. I don't really care. I don't really care if it's 90 day options. What I care about is how do I best capture this profit mechanism? Next thing is for directional trades. I have a bullish tendency in me and it's because markets quantitatively display bullish drift. So I don't look to stand in front of that unless there's a really good reason. So I typically am looking for trend, momentum, drift style directional plays. I like breakouts, break downs like I showed you in that rep position. And then these are the strategies that I use for bullish and bearish directional trades. I have videos about all of these. I have",

And then these are the strategies that I use for bullish and bearish directional trades. I have videos about all of these. I have an entire playlist. I'll link in the notes below that goes through all of them. As you could tell, the stable ain't that deep. I focus on simple strategies that I can execute really well. It's the same thing we use in the Marine Corps brilliance at the basics. That's really what I look to convey with what I'm doing in the markets. I'm not looking for the 62 leg dragon leaping frog spread. I want the simplest expression of structures that allow me to capture the profit mechanism. Not as sexy as the dragon fire breathing leaping frog spread, but gets the job done. Looking at volatility, this is a really important aspect for option traders. And the reason being is because it provides a completely different style of return than equities products typically. So with volatility, I'm looking to trade things like variance risk premium, which I have a video on that. I'll link to it below. Mean reversion for volatility extremes, either upside or downside because volatility is mean reverting and then relative value and skew between different options chains between different strikes. You can find things that have a little excessive or not enough wall compared",

Mean reversion for volatility extremes, either upside or downside because volatility is mean reverting and then relative value and skew between different options chains between different strikes. You can find things that have a little excessive or not enough wall compared to what it historically might. And these are the strategies that I use to capture most of those. I would add single options, both long calls and puts short calls, short puts to these for really for the more relative value or calendars stuff like that. But this is the heart and soul of what I do here. And now for analysis, I have videos that go through how I apply analysis to markets in general. But as I already told you, it's combined. I'm going to use technical fundamental analysis. I'm going to use everything I can find and successfully quantify. The main things I'm looking for are price and volume. That leads everything. So all of the different indicators that I have on the chart are designed to help me visualize price and volume because that's what matters. So these are just moving averages, standard deviation channels, volume profile on stuff that has an underlying that trade. So if you grab Apple, you'll see the volume profile over here, volume down here, average volume over certain durations, those kinds of things. The idea is to do my best to analyze what the market is doing and figure out",
