    "text": "All of us traders are degenerates at heart, however, the goal of this video is to help some of my game stop people think about buying call options or really any option a little bit differently so that rather than putting on positions that magically vanish in a couple of days and all your money has gone, we might actually stand a chance at making some money out here because what we don't want is to be in the scenario of our friend and teak marketing who's down 99.68 with 32 left to go, super unfortunate. But who knows, they have some Apple options, expire in this week, they're pay off might be there. My guess is they're probably making a bunch of the mistakes I'm about to walk through with you guys. We're going to talk about kind of looking at options a little bit differently through the lens of these three things. Days, expiration, how long the contract lasts. The delta of the option, delta simply measures the rate of change of an options premium for every one dollar move in the underlying and then gamma which is simply the rate of change of delta. So I am not going to get super theoretical here. My goal is to keep this as practical as possible. So with that, let's get straight over into the platform and we're going to grab GameStop in dig right in. Okay. So the first thing to know is you notice the first thing",

So with that, let's get straight over into the platform and we're going to grab GameStop in dig right in. Okay. So the first thing to know is you notice the first thing on our list is picking DTE, Dase Taxpiration. What expiration makes the most sense? Here's the way to think about it. The further out in time you go, the more expensive, extrenzic value gets for options. Also, the slower gamma will move, which matters specifically for out of the money options. And I'll explain how. So that's the first thing. The further out in time you go, the more expensive the options get because there's more extrinsic value, gamma has a dampened effect. What's the benefit? Your trade now has a longer time to work. Although your theta decay will be higher in a gross dollar amount, your daily theta decay as a percent of the resulting premium will be less. So let's take a look at exactly what that means. If we go out here to 120 days to expiration and we look at really anything, let's find this 60 delta call right now in GameStop. So we can see this is gamma, this is theta. And I'm specifically focusing on the call options because I imagine that's probably what most of you guys are playing, but the same stuff generally applies to the put options as well. So",

And I'm specifically focusing on the call options because I imagine that's probably what most of you guys are playing, but the same stuff generally applies to the put options as well. So if we look at these 60 delta calls right now, they have a 0.02 gamma. So that means for every one point move in the underlying delta is going to move by 0.02. Everything else remaining the same good old Latin saying setteress perabis. Now theta notice what theta is negative 0.03. This means as each day that passes, these options are going to lose a resense again, everything else remaining the same. A couple notes that are really important here. Options that are out of the money are all extrinsic value. Extrinsic value kind of is two components. First component is how much time the second component is volatility, how much volatility are we pricing in those options. So as you go further on time, the more extrinsic value you will have. As you go deeper in the money, your options will have more intrinsic value and less extrinsic value. They will be a higher delta. So what does all this mean? The very first juncture we need to cross is what expiration to pick. For me, I typically try to go at least greater than 60 days to expiration. The reason for that is option theta to k",

So let's take a look at what this looks like again. 60 delta these have a 0.03 theta. Let's now go into 29 find a 60 delta. This is a 62 that's pretty close. Beta now is negative 0.07. What do you notice? The daily theta decay just skyrocketed going from 120 which was three cents into 29 days to expiration is double in change. Seven cents massive way higher. And also what's most important is if you think about your theta decay this seven cents on a percentage of the premium. These are trading for 460, 465 something like that. They're losing seven cents every single day. That's a much larger percentage of the total premium that's eroding on a daily basis. If we go again out here to the 120s, not only is the theta much lower for the 60s, it's again three, three cents, but look at the price of the options. They're much more expensive. So as a percentage, you're also losing way less of your total premium. So that's the expiration decision. To me, in general, it's kind of just easy. If you go at",

So that's the expiration decision. To me, in general, it's kind of just easy. If you go at the very least, the very least greater than 30 days out, ideally 60 plus for me, most of my trades are 90 plus. But again, I trade these a little bit differently than most people. So it might not be a direct corollary. I'm just giving you some ballpark to go off of. Because we need to now talk about gamma. When we're buying options, a lot of times people will be lured into these really cheap, really far out of the money options. Like these 21 dunes that expire in one day and the 125s, where there's 113,000 open interest. That's not saying all those people entered today. They didn't, but a lot of people entered these. These are very far out of the money. So the reason why we care about gamma is because gamma tells us how fast we're going to see profit if we start getting a big move in our favor. Because if you remember, Delta tells us the rate of change of an option's premium. So in this case, if Gamestop moves 1 in our favor, this literally is going to move less than a penny.

    "text": "a big move in our favor. Because if you remember, Delta tells us the rate of change of an option's premium. So in this case, if Gamestop moves 1 in our favor, this literally is going to move less than a penny. There's the Delta is so low in these options that it's going to be a third digit. You're not even going to see it. The other problem here is that as you get that first dollar move in your favor, gamma doesn't even start turning on. And what does that mean? Well, if we take a look here, something like a 15 Delta. Notice what the gamma is, 0.06. So that means that if you get a 1 move in your favor, these options are going to give you 15 cents or 15 because the multiplier for options is 100. 100. So you get 15 bucks, but something else happened along that. This 15 Delta just gains six more Delta. So now if you get another dollar move in your favor, instead of just seeing 15 cents, you now see 21 cents. And what do you notice? Options that are closer to at the money have much higher gamma. The other thing you'll notice is options that are closer in time have a much higher gamma. So this is 1 d to e. The at the money here is a 16 gamma. We go all the way out here to the 120s.

We go all the way out here to the 120s. We go to the at the money. The gamma is 0.02. Why is that simple? Options have to make a choice. As we get closer to expiration, it's either going to be in the money and have a Delta of one or it's going to be out of the money and have a Delta of zero. So, gamma tells us the rate of change of Delta. So that's why it gets so jacked up as we get closer to expiration. All of these options are in the process of making a big choice. Either in the money Delta of one out of the money Delta of zero. That's also why gamma is highest for at the money options. Because they're going to swing a ton. This is going to go from a 46 Delta either to a one Delta or to a zero Delta. That means it needs to be able to change a lot. That's what gamma is measuring. If you go to the super far out of the money options, they're not going to change much at all because they're as zero Delta. They're probably going to be as zero Delta.

They're probably going to be as zero Delta. Meaning they're going to expire worthless. That's what this is. So taking this back to what we care about Delta is the next big selection. And I just gave you kind of a preamble on the way to think about Delta to a degree. Delta makes our options more expensive. The higher the Delta is, but you get a better dollar for dollar move with the underlying. What that means is in this case, if GameStop goes up a dollar. In these 25s for example, you would have paid a dollar six something like that. So you pay your dollar here. You get a dollar move in the underlying. You get to see 54 cents of profit added to these. The premiums going to move by 54 cents. Whereas if you go super far out of the money, you get that same 1 move. You're only going to see a nickel as compared to 54 cents. What's the trade off here? Good question. As your Delta's are higher, the options are more expensive. Notice this one you have to buy for a dollar. This one you can buy for 11 cents. Now you might be thinking, well, what if I just buy a dollars worth of these? It's a great question. However, unfortunately,",

So these are a 64 Delta expiring in 2018. These are a 49 Delta expiring 28 units. Sorry. Let's take a look at creating the same size trade. These are trading for 53 cents. So to get them closer to that 3 mark, we'll do six of them. So now they're about the same. Let's take a look at some scenarios. If we look at the 60 Delta's, the 24 calls that we paid 3 for, and let's say we get a plus two standard deviation move. You're going to make 326 bucks. If we compare that to the six of the 49's, and we get that same move, you're going to get 335 bucks. So what do you notice right out of the gate? At the same size, you put on the same size position overall. These make just a little bit more on a two standard deviation move, which the vast majority of the time you're not going to see that.

Remember, standard bell curve, 68.7 of data falls within, one standard deviation, 95 of data within two. So that's both sides, by the way. So it's essentially a 2.5 chance of getting that moving your favorite give or take. So it's just important to know that even if you think about putting the same size total cost position on and a much lower Delta option, you still need a really big move in order to even catch up to getting a higher Delta option right out of the gate. So what does this mean? Well, we know then that if we go further out of the money, our options are going to move less due to both Delta and Gamma. If they're further in the money, your Gamma will slow down because you're already near one Delta. And once you're at a one Delta, you get a 1 move for every 1 move in the underlying. It's essentially just leveraged stock. So you have to figure out the correct balance for you. And I'll tell you what I typically look for.

    "text": "balance for you. And I'll tell you what I typically look for. When I'm going out again, at least 30 days, preferably 60 plus maybe these 57s are fine, something like that, I will look starting at the money. The downside, they're more expensive. They're more expensive by going further out in time. They're more expensive because they're a higher Delta. So I will structure a position that has a base position using these kinds of options that are at least 60 Delta plus and have a little bit of time to work. Even if I'm not expecting to hold them for 57 days, I'm typically not. I just don't want to pay that much in daily, faded a K by coming in super close in time and having the majority of my position to K away. So if we go all the way out here, again, to these 120s, I'm losing three cents a day by going slightly in the money here. I'm going to pay more upfront for that, but I'm not expecting to lose all of it. I'm actually expecting to recapture most of it. So that's the way I think about it. I'm going to go again, little further out in time, slightly higher Delta. Now the last thing to add is you can add what I call the kicker options to amplify the position. So what that could look like is let's say in this scenario, I pick that further out in time option that's",

    "text": "again, little further out in time, slightly higher Delta. Now the last thing to add is you can add what I call the kicker options to amplify the position. So what that could look like is let's say in this scenario, I pick that further out in time option that's deeper in the money. This is the base position. And I say, okay, well, I'm really bullish for some reason. I think the stock I'm looking at is going to fly off the handle. So let me add some closer in time, further out of the money options that have the ability to appreciate a lot. This is why Gamma is so important because by going closer in time, let's say two weeks out, I can find things that have really high Gamma on a relative basis. So that means if I start getting in accommodating move in my favor, the position can start to compound massively. Because when we compare low Delta to high Delta's, high Delta trades, they don't have the same percent returns, meaning they don't compound as much, but you can make more money on a gross dollar amount than the further out of the money options. So again, we're at another trade off. So to summarize all of that, these are the three things you have to keep in mind when you're buying options, Delta. How far out in time are you willing to go? How much time do you want to trade to have?",

How far out in time are you willing to go? How much time do you want to trade to have? The more time you give it, the more expensive it becomes. Delta, the higher the Delta, the better dollar for dollar move, you're going to get, the more expensive the options are going to be. The slower your thated K is going to be, the less your money will compound. Gamma, the closer in time you are and the closer to at the money, the higher your gamma is going to be. You want to have some exposure to Gamma, but if you're super close in time and you're out of the money, you are fighting so much thated K as a percentage of your position that it's going to erode away to nothing. And to drive that final point home, if we look at this one, not even this one, let's look at the ATTE and we look at something like this, the 37's. These are still a 20 Delta almost, 17 Delta, like pretty high. But if you look at the theta, it's 14 cents. These options cost 70 cents, something like that. So of that 70-cent position you put on, you're losing 14 cents every single day that you don't get to move in your favor until",
