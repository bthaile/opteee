    "text": "What's up outliers? Quick market updates. I'm going to start doing a GameStop video on Tuesday specifically so that we can recap some of the things that we learned on Saturday's stream right now. We're looking at due diligence and stuff like that. I want to take a look at the stock itself, GameStop. And then I want to talk about the GameStop coverage strangle that I have on as an example trade for everybody. And then for those that are following the coverage strangle strategies that I'm sharing with everybody, I will do a standalone update for those on Thursday. So first things first, let's take a look at the stock itself. We obviously had that pretty big sell off. I did a video on this actually. I actually think last Tuesday potentially. And it's just because it was really interesting to me. There was no real news to necessitate the move that ties to this as to why it might have happened. And the move is continued. So the first thing I flagged actually was a bit of a support level. I'll draw it with a regular line here so that you can see, but it's essentially below this consolidation range here. And this is really the bottom of this large volume node that we have. And below this, there's a big ol gap. You can see that this is the very bottom of this consolidation range here. And this is kind of like the last line before",

You can see that this is the very bottom of this consolidation range here. And this is kind of like the last line before there's just very light volume leading into this. This is a great example. Unfortunately, of how stocks tend to require pretty significant sponsorship in order to appreciate and value, but they can fall under their own weight. And I say that because even the move that we saw today, slightly lower or about equivalent to what we saw on the 17th, but the difference is it had this big WIC came back up. And it really inside day looks like it's continuing this downward trend. So this trend line that I drew a while ago clearly has just been firmly broken. This is no longer relevant. And what's become more relevant in my opinion is actually this downward trend line now. And you can see that it's very steep. The overall velocity potential of this is nothing really to scoff at. And it's coming into its next area of congestion as far as I'm concerned with the same admin note as per always. GameStop does not follow standard technical analysis.

It follows standard technical analysis a lot of the time, but the reason why I say it doesn't is because it violates standard technical analysis at very key times. And that's why. So if we take a look at things like RSI right now, the seven day VWOP RSI average is negative sloping. It's crossing under 50. We can see that the RSA RSI line itself is kind of leveling off a little bit, but still below the moving average and still below 50, which is typically a bearish configuration. If we stroll over quickly to take a look at the options, volatility is all but gone. 87.7 vol in the front expiration 80, 86, 85. It's just very, very quiet. We can see a slight uptick in vol still here in this seven Feb expiration where it jumps from 80.9 to 86.5. So typically that indicates the market is thinking something is going on there. We took a look at this on the live stream on Saturday. And I'm actually not sure what we came up with other than nobody was really certain if there's any expected news or anything. If you know anything about that, I would love to know. But the other thing we spent a little time on the stream Saturday taking",

If you know anything about that, I would love to know. But the other thing we spent a little time on the stream Saturday taking a look at together was the due diligence library. And I bring that up because I've been going through the due diligence due diligence library for what we're on episode 11 now. So we've been looking at it for some time. And there was a lot of interesting things that we came across in the latest iteration. What we were spending a lot of time looking at were a couple AMAs related to just the overall behavior. This is a little bit older in nature. But then we also spent a little time looking at some important news as far as I'm concerned, which I will reiterate here for you all again. Like I said, we'll do a little bit of a recap of what we cover on the Saturday streams, which is store closures. And one of the things we were trying to figure out is with that original down move is was it because there's some sort of acceleration of store closures that we didn't know about. And it's really nothing like that. There were two closed in 2025. The bulk, this is looking at Pacific Northwest stores to be clear. And we know that there was a",

The bulk, this is looking at Pacific Northwest stores to be clear. And we know that there was a handful in 24. But all this stuff is already generally priced in. This is all older stuff. So none of that really explains the movement that we saw. But then volatility just essentially vanished across the board. The overall options chain here is light, but still very, very skewed to calls. 523,000 calls against 172,000 puts. So big, big, big call skew. We take a look and see what expiration those are centered in. There's 91,000. So almost a fifth is in 24 Jan this upcoming expiration 31 Jan is at 70 K. So again, another pretty big block. It tailors off for seven Feb 14 Feb is really light. 21 Feb is kind of the next heaviest. And then we don't see another big one until 17 April, which these further out explorations are kind of normal to see a little more depth in because these are going to be primary explorations. But you know, anywhere from six, nine, 12 months, I don't know why I was say 12 months. That was pretty dumb. Around three to six months is what I was going for.

So it's a bit of a mix between some of these primary initial near term explorations that we see the bulk. And then we see a couple concentrations out in 17 April, 20 June. This is important because as we watch for options flow to see if anything might be materializing, any positioning might be coming out. We look for deviations off of this and where it is. So that's why I flagged that for you. We look at TNS time and sales. There was, you know, standard market activity today. Most of the trades were on the smaller side of things, but the larger trades is for as quantity size where a lot of pretty far out of the money. So like this 303, 393 contract.

Let's get rid of the put side of the equation for now just to look at calls. And this is looking for this week. And I'm not filtering it by the side of the trade. I'm just looking at all of them and looking at the premium. You can see that there's just not a lot of really sizable trades coming through right now. There was one, but again, this is for an old expiration that already came up for the 17th of Jan. So no real, no real takeaway from that. They probably would have moved their position out.

So right now as it sits, I'm actually down to 200 shares at a basis of 2827. What ended up happening was on the 14th of Jan, I unwound 100 shares. The basis of those was 2431. I sold them for 2890. And it was a PNL realized of 460 bucks. The reason for that sale was just to lighten the load a little bit during this down move, because I didn't know how far it was going to come down. And you can see of the total amount that's cash secured of this allocation of 25,000. It's only 22.6 right now in the equity. The reason why that's so important is because I can always buy more. It's easy for me to add. But what becomes a little more challenging is that if it does continue this decline, I don't want to hold a higher basis because it does me no real good. I can't sell calls against it above my basis. I would have to sell them below my basis, which becomes a",

    "text": "what becomes a little more challenging is that if it does continue this decline, I don't want to hold a higher basis because it does me no real good. I can't sell calls against it above my basis. I would have to sell them below my basis, which becomes a problem in something specifically like game stop. I am way more reluctant to sell calls below my basis and game stop is compared to other things because of how quickly it can start to move. That can be a big problem. And again, this is a standard lesson for the coverage strangle not limited to game stop, but it's understanding how to tailor the strategy, the individual underlying that we're looking at. And in this case, we know game stop can have really big moves. The next thing here is you can see, I took down a few of the short puts that we had. Didn't take them down for much. But what I'm doing is I'm regaining spot price sensitivity. So this one came down because the 28s essentially were starting to fall in the money. And then the 26s are getting close to being at the money. So all I did was consolidate these trades. So on the 17th, I offered five of the 25 strike, 21 feb 25s for a dollar six, pretty light premium relative to game stop, but still an incredibly good return on a vested capital there. And then you can see I still",

So on the 17th, I offered five of the 25 strike, 21 feb 25s for a dollar six, pretty light premium relative to game stop, but still an incredibly good return on a vested capital there. And then you can see I still have the 200 shares. So I'm only selling one call against them. So right now I'm short, the 21 feb 35 call is a 35 delta when I sold it. And the premium on that was a dollar 93. So the total realized PNL on the trade is a thousand 70 bucks. The total PNL, including the equity position and the open options is 16 33. So we are, we are in the early stages of this entire thing. We're not really moving things too quickly. We're just playing it nice and conservatively, but keeping a really nice sensitive basis. Because right now we're only 72.6 utilized. So what that means is even though I have cash secured puts out right now that are in 21 feb, what it allows me to do is that if game stop starts moving, I can just buy shares again in order to capture that movement and to participate to the upside and if it does unfortunately, it's downward move. I'll be in a position to still manage the trade, make as much money as I can so that I can continue scaling the position. The total value of the position as it sits",
