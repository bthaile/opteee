    "text": "always buy more it's easy for me to add but what becomes a little more challenging is that if it does continue this decline I don't want to hold a higher basis because it does me no real good I can't sell calls against it above my basis I would have to sell them below my bases which becomes a problem in something specifically like GameStop I am way more reluctant to sell calls below my basis in GameStop as compared to other things because of how quickly it can start to move that can be a big problem and again this is a standard lesson for the coverage strangle not limited to GameStop but it's understanding how to tailor the strategy to the individual underlying that we're looking at and in this case we no GameStop can have really big moves the next thing here is you can see I took down a few of the short puts that we had didn't take them down for much but what I'm doing is I'm regaining spot price sensitivity so this one came down because the 28s essentially were starting to fall in the money and then the 26s are getting close to being at the money so all I did was consolidate these trades so on the 17th I offered five of the 25 strike 21 Feb 25s for6 pretty light premium relative to GameStop but still an incredibly good return on invested Capital there and then you can see",
