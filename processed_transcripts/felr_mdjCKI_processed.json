    "text": "do you know the difference between good and bad risk as a Trader my guess is most Traders out there have an idea on a spectrum but it's not really well- defined so the goal of this video is to walk you through in detail good risk versus bad risk with examples and then at the end of the video I'm going to go through some best practices that I've learned from Trading over the years what's up everybody welcome back to all the outliers and a shout out to the patreon family you guys make content like this Poss for everybody else so thank you for the support let's get straight into it so first let's start with level setting how do we make money in the markets well really there's these two broad buckets you can either earn the risk-free rate so kind of Government Bond investing something like that which is seen as very very low risk which typically will correspond to pretty low returns or you can take risk of some sort you can take speculative risk and guess on a direction you can offload risk for another Trader by assuming their risk via selling cash secured puts where somebody's buying puts for protection and you're selling them there are lots of different ways to take risk but the idea here is for us to understand the difference between good and bad risk and then most importantly to understand what our individual risk profiles are so",
