    "text": "what's up outliers today we're going to talk about trading meme stocks with options the whole goal of this video is to hopefully change the way we think about using options because I know for a lot of Traders they think it's kind of fast easy money to get leverage but the problem is is most of us are structuring trades probably the exact wrong way so what I'm guessing is the majority of you that have tried this have probably bought some sort of Fairly near-term dated option that's pretty far out of the money and you kind of just watch your money evaporate in front of your eyes so the goal is to not do that so let's dive straight in and get into the details so first off I'm going to give you some general concepts to keep in mind about trading directionally with options and then we'll get into the specifics about meme stocks as an example so when we're trading directionally with options there's a few things that need to be nailed down before we even start the first one is the profit mechanism so a lot of people will start just picking different option structures not paying attention to the fact that if you pick the wrong option structure then you know you may or may not make money it's hard to tell but what I can guarantee you is that if you don't have a defined profit mechanism doesn't matter what option structure",

    "text": "better well maybe I'll go further in time but get these cheap options well the problem with the cheap options is they will have lower gamma being further out in time so if I show you gamma this is showing you two different expirations this is showing you 10 DTE versus 30 DTE and if you go to like 60 it's even further down here so the problem is if gamma is too low and you have a low Delta so let's take a look at these 34s for example if GameStop goes up by a dollar my options will appreciate by 30 cents and then my Delta will gain by three so this will go from 30 to 33 it's not bad but compare that to these 18s that I was modeling in the other trade in this case if GameStop goes up by a doll the premium will change by7 cents or 70 and then I'll gain four gamma so I'll get a little bit more gamma and on a dollar for dooll move I'll make more but here's the trade-off it's more money upfront your money is not going to compound as much compare that to the inverse if you buy further out of the money options no matter if it's closer far they're going to Decay more quickly and if it's a lower Delta and further out in time they're less sensitive to price movements so then you stand to make less overall this is the",
