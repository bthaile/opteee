    "text": "Nobody likes to hear this part about trading, but it's super important nonetheless. Your 5,010,020,000 dollar account is not going to be your future wealth. It is going to be part of your journey. It's going to be part of what you used to develop your skillset, but the two most important things early on for new traders is saving money and avoiding huge drawdowns. That is what will get you to where you want to be. It's not having a 20,000 account and trying to 50 fold it on yellow trades. It's a good way to lose your money. Focus on the higher probability outcomes, put in the work to develop the skill set, and you will be far better off for it than you're done in the line. Be an outlier seller.",
