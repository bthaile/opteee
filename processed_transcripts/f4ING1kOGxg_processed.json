How do we look? That looks okay. We're getting ready to kick off another part four actually of our beginner options trading live streams. We pop out this chat. I'm going to move it over here so I can keep an eyeball on everybody. As you guys know, these are designed to be interactive sessions. So more than anything, if there's something that you guys want to talk about, if there's something that you guys have a question on, if there's something that you would like to take a look at, let me know. That is literally the entire purpose of doing these in this format is so that we can hang out, interact and kind of talk about the exact things that you guys want to. So for today, there were a couple questions that I had sent in and then I also have kind of this outline for analyzing options chains, which builds off really well what we've covered so far. So the goal behind this video at the end of it, you should have a better idea of looking at analyzing options chains, how to look for anomalies, how to identify good versus bad opportunities, at least in terms of cost and execution. We should have a better understanding of volatility, specifically",

We should have a better understanding of volatility, specifically as it pertains to surfaces and smiles, so that when you're structuring trades, you have a much better roadmap on what you're deciding. If any of you guys had a chance to check out the video I launched today, you'll notice actually quite a few of these concepts baked into it as we're taking a look at things. So that is a rough overview of what's on the agenda. As you guys know, we got to say hello to everybody in the chat and it's always the best to be able to chat with the outliers on a beautiful Friday. So let's see who we have in store. I see Paulo James. What's up, James? Welcome to thank you for the support on outlier bronze. I really appreciate that. Roaring Titty, I don't know if there's a funnier name in here right now. I say it all the time, one of the greatest things about YouTube and about Reddit about all these different kinds of communities. It reminds me of like the old game stop or game stop, the old Xbox gamer tags people had that were always just so ratchet. So I have a deep appreciation for that. Let's",

But normally I have a podcast episode that comes out every Wednesday and then every Saturday is a video. And then typically Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday is live stream. I much prefer the live streams. It's because as you can tell, I'm not like some sort of great video producer. I'm not great at telling these super funny stories like my buddy Benjamin, his YouTube channel, which you guys should absolutely check out. He's he's masterful. But what I do like to do is share what I know.",

Reese says, new subscriber first time commenter been binging your videos great work. That's awesome. That's good. Where you at Reese in your options trading process, roaring titty, which I will never get tired of saying that name. How do you keep up the data real time with the volatile stock? I find options move pretty fast for me. Yeah, I think for that, it depends on what kind of data you're trying to keep track of because well, yeah, maybe we'll start with a question there for you. What data are you trying to track? Because for me, a lot of things that I do is once I have something set up, I'm going to set primarily alerts or what I need to interact with it or what I'm looking for new opportunity.

So the process of paper trading, I think, is always with everything else. You got to start with defining the goal. For me, the goal of paper trading is to validate ideas. It's to develop a much, much better understanding of the product that we're looking at. And it's absolutely to make sure that you can create a usable data set over time. That's kind of like the origin, the process of paper trading. So I think the first thing to focus on with paper trading is defining your ideas. Then I think the next thing to focus on is building a trade log that lets you track the performance of those ideas. Those are the first two steps. After that, I think you can start getting closer into the world of trying different ideas. So say, for example, you don't know yet, let's say you don't know yet, that the wheel typically underperforms by and hold. And let's say that you're under the impression that the wheel or covered calls is the greatest thing on earth. And that's what you should",

And let's say that you're under the impression that the wheel or covered calls is the greatest thing on earth. And that's what you should be doing. And there's nothing wrong with that strategy to be very, very clear. But a lot of people mistakenly think it performs better than it does. So you're trading your covered calls and your original hypothesis is I want to be able to maximize my portfolio growth on a monthly basis. Then you kind of start noticing wait a minute. If I'm comparing against a benchmark in whatever it is that you're trading. So let's say you're trading stock XYZ. And in your trade log, I would set up like two different components. The first component would be just buy and hold XYZ. Then underneath that, I would set up a trade log that lets me track how I think I'm going to trade my strategy. And so maybe it starts with selling a 30 Delta put and I sell these 30 Delta puts until I get assigned. Then I buy the shares. All that's tracked. And then at the end of the month, you might look down and say, huh. So the stock went sideways and I made way more money with the wheel than I did with buying shares. Interesting data point.

So the stock went sideways and I made way more money with the wheel than I did with buying shares. Interesting data point. Then it's only a month. You can't conclude anything from that yet. But then you can go down that path over the next few months and you can say, well, it seems like maybe if the stock that I really like is going through a consolidation period and moving sideways, maybe instead of buying shares, I focus on something like selling puts, selling the wheel, running the first part of the wheel. And then as it starts to accelerate and show that upside momentum that you can make more money on, then maybe you pivot to either buying shares outright or scaling into your position. So there's a lot of different ways that you can structure ideas and the purpose of paper trading is to be able to test them. The other thing, not specific to ideas that I think is really important to integrate into paper trading regimen is actually looking at markets. So one of the things I recommend to people, especially people that are in like the the Patreon side of things that I interact with on this level a little more regularly, what I try to do is get them to think about what the profit mechanisms that you're trying to",

So let's say for a profit mechanism you're talking about trading something breakout upside, breakout downsides, some sort of momentum breakout. Well, what I would do, even if I'm not necessarily placing trades, but what I would do is set up a tab in my paper trading log to then test this profit mechanism. And I would say, well, I think there's edge in trading things that consolidate for X period of time and then have some sort of breakout. So I would find names, I would create a scan that lets me find names for all of these. And then I would create PL targets for all of them. So let me walk you through a specific example of this so that it's a little less esoteric. And it actually works really well because this one, here's a trade that I have on right now. So on the 27th of June, which is yesterday, I bought to open a number of the reason why I don't have the number here is because it doesn't really matter for this example. But I have a number",

Well, I have a scan that lets me look for what I consider to be interesting short term short opportunities. And that's what this is. So kind of glossing over a lot of the analysis here, if I bought this option with the expectation that it's going to go down, then let's say that there's no trade part of this. Let's just say that I'm practicing looking for breakdowns. And part of what I'm thinking about in a breakdown is, I want to see something that was consolidating for a while, started making lower lows, consolidated, and then started falling through that consolidation period. Maybe that's the scan. So that's actually how I found this name was on one of my scans. So then I enter in this position, you don't even have to enter the position.

And then there was a bit of a continuation to the downside. So I slid my stop down just a bit to capitalize on this breakdown.

He was like in here whimpering because he knows he's not allowed to bark in here, but then as soon literally as soon as I cracked the door, I just got like one bark out of him. Just one.

    "text": "a crackhead. Yeah, so that's kind of the paper trading. Let me get caught up on the chat here. Roink Titties says hit the like for the YouTube YouTube algorithm. I'm an that's exactly right. Please do that. That's how we emerge from the depths of YouTube. Reese followed up on my ask on how new to options. Few years only just found out how bad vertical spreads are. Thanks for that. Curious if you dislike put credit spreads equally. Um, yeah, so here's the way I would think about verticals is in general, I avoid them like the vast majority of cases. There's not a solid reason to trade them. Now if there are smaller structural reasons why it might make sense for you to gain access via a vertical then so be it, but it's suboptimal. Like there's nothing that's generally optimal about a vertical spread. Everything that you attempt to take advantage of the whole point of a vertical spread is it dampens the risk profile. So yeah, in general, I'm not a giant fan of verticals. It's not the worst thing on planet earth, but it is not my go to now. There are ways you can bake in things like verticals that could make sense. So for example, something as simple as using verticals to buy the wings of something, so that you don't have unlimited risk in a direction that you don't want to have unlimited risk. Or if you have a small account",

So for example, something as simple as using verticals to buy the wings of something, so that you don't have unlimited risk in a direction that you don't want to have unlimited risk. Or if you have a small account and you need a way to decrease the margin requirement, that's okay to use a vertical for those reasons, but you have to know the tradeoff to that. The tradeoff is as you're doing that, you're losing efficiency on the underlying thesis that you're trying to trade. That's what that boils down to and that might be a tradeoff that you're willing to make. That's the most beautiful part about options is you get to structure things to be exactly what you want. So in this example, if you want a trade that you could put on, that gives you your directional disposition that you want, but you don't want to put on too much risk because you have a small account, you absolutely can make that tradeoff. You could have a slightly less optimal directional exposure position that has a lower capital requirement. You can do that. So yeah, it's not necessarily that I dislike one type of vertical over others in general verticals suck. And there's in time and place for everything. I trade verticals sometimes, but it's like if I'm trading something really explosive through earnings, those kinds of products, I'm generally going to cap risk. So",

So depending on how the options are priced, if you take a look at the implied move relative to the if you take a look at the implied relative to realize move and you look at enough instances where the realize move exceeds the implied, you might say, okay, well, I might still think that there's going to be excess IV, but if there's not, I don't want to get ran over. So maybe I will spread this trade off. So in this case, you can trade something like the, you know, 30 delta short options for a strangle, but then buy the wings so that if there is this big, outsized move compared to the expectation, you don't get killed. Again, just a general, a general idea. And let me see really quick. The, I think this came actually just within the expected move almost. Oh no, it definitely didn't. My bad. It was expected at 5.7. Came in at 19 point, it came in at 20. Massive, massive, misalignment on the expected move. That's crazy. So yeah, that's kind of a time and place that you can use verticals. So to summarize all of that, I don't like verticals because they're generally inefficient.",

So the first thing is when we're looking at implied volatility, it's super important to like when you're looking at an individual product to look at percentile or rank. I prefer percentile. The reason why you need to do this is because to your point, if you say the IV is 51, it seems high to you, but you don't know what range is good. It's a completely smart question to ask. And the fact of the matter is, as if somebody says the IV is 51, you have no idea. Like, you literally have no idea if that's higher low. You know it's 51, you know the number. But the reason why that matters is because implied volatility is very specific to an individual stock. So you can have an individual stock like Nvidia where 51 IV clearly is high. It's 67 tile. So that is high. But you can have other products that tend to have really high IV. Let's see if this is a good example. It's not. Let me see of another one. This is a great example. So if we take a look at GE, the implied volatility is 32. That seems really low compared to what we were just looking at. But if you look at the IV percentile,",

That seems really low compared to what we were just looking at. But if you look at the IV percentile, it's 81. So that means on a relative basis, IV is super high for GE at 32 that leads to this IVP being so inflated. So it's very relative to the product. So when I look at your scenario in Nvidia, I think on a relative basis, it's expensive, relative basis, 67 IV. So then if we go out to the 16-og 49 days out, it's 52. So it's definitely cheaper than some of the spot IV. So you make a little bit of a better world for yourself there. And then if we kill some of these strikes, let's come into like 50. And you said you got the 160, which is super far out of the money, which is, well, not super far, but it's pretty far out of the money. This is not my trade at all. Yeah, so these are like a 10 delta. To me, this is going to be really expensive for what it is. Because as you can see, these are a 51 IV as compared to something that's closer to at the money, or even slightly in the money, which is like 48. It's not a big variant. So you're not getting",

Because as you can see, these are a 51 IV as compared to something that's closer to at the money, or even slightly in the money, which is like 48. It's not a big variant. So you're not getting killed here. But yeah, on a relative basis, this is slightly more expensive. The downside to this is because this is all extrinsic value. Your premium now, your basis that you got in at is going to be highly susceptible to moves in implied volatility. You can see that here represented by Vega for those that don't know the Greek in this case Vega represents changes in implied volatility and the impact on an options premium. So in this case, when implied volatility moves one point, your premium will change by eight cents, which is not insignificant on a dollar 10 product. So yeah, this will absolutely be quite susceptible to changes in IV. Now, the good part is if you get a good move in your favor, it doesn't matter. You will be fine because the primary profit mechanism for that long call is going to be direction. But the other downside to that long call selection is because it's really far out of the money. So what that means is let's say we get a move in Nvidia. Let's say Nvidia moves an entire dollar in our favor. Cool. We get a dollar move in our favor. Your",

Let's say Nvidia moves an entire dollar in our favor. Cool. We get a dollar move in our favor. Your options are going to see 11 cents of that dollar. Your options are not going to see much at all. And the more annoying point part is over the course of that same day, you're going to lose five cents. So if you get your dollar move, you're going to see an 11 cent positive return. You're going to see negative five cents come out of that 11 cents. It's not quite that discreet to be very, very clear. But markets are closed. And I'm giving you kind of a linear example on how these things tie together. And the other thing to keep in mind is if Nvidia goes up, its implied volatility will likely contract. Volatility normally will contract as things go up. Do you probably going to get hit by this Vega to some degree, which will decrease the premium of your options that will work against you? So the trade can move if you get a big positive move in your favor. That's essentially what that boils down to. That's not to say it's dead in the water.

Can you tell me the difference between long and short and option? Yeah, absolutely. Actually, I bet you somebody from the chat can tell you exactly what the difference is. So I defer to you all knowing chat. What's the difference? You guys know the answer to that? Short is selling long as mine. Bingo. That's exactly correct. So the way I would answer the question is the difference between long and short and option is if you were long, it means you bought to open. If you are short, it means you've sold to open. Now it can be a little tricky because here we go here. It can be a little tricky because you can be long or short in option and simultaneously be long or short the underlying itself. So the way to think about the concept of long and short is it applies to a transaction as well as a disposition. So for example, if I buy a put, I'm long a put, but you can be short the stock in that instance, meaning you want it to go down, puts make money as the underlying goes down to be long a put short the stock. Now you can also be short the stock outright, which means you've sold to open shares. You've borrowed shares and you",

I don't know if it's context or context. There's two contexts. That sounds better. So there's two contexts. There's the transaction and then there's the disposition. So think about it in that sense as well. That might help a little bit. Let me know if that answers your question. Paulos says what happened to Nike bad earnings? They got murdered on earnings today.

And we were going through an example for him a while ago where we were just doing a scenario where we like started buying in here and we were trying to run through a perspective trade. Now there's inverse and we didn't get to that point of his trade, but we can take a quick look at it. So we did the scenario that he was selling cash secured puts for his weekly income. Then he gets assigned in the underlying drops and drops and drops. He's not able to make any money on those short calls, but he's trying to use the short calls against the long shares in order to make some sort of premium.

So the way to think about trading covered calls is when you want to collect premium against an underlying that you hold. You're okay sacrificing the upside and you're okay if the underlying gets called away. So I have a video on a slightly better take on a covered call, which is this, which is a ratio covered call where we maintain unlimited upside potential, which I actually think is really, really important. So that's the general idea there. Ethan says, been loving your vids learning a lot about how to read options and information. That's awesome. That's actually what we're going to take a closer look at in a few minutes. Paul says, can you somehow defend a covered call? Absolutely. There's a bunch of different things you can do with a covered call. So the way to think about defending a covered call is I'm literally doing it right now in, well, it's a ratio called diagonal. So it's not exactly a covered call, but it's a similar concept, which is here in excess P. This is just another example trade I wanted to share with you guys. We may or not have time for it, which",

    "text": "it right now in, well, it's a ratio called diagonal. So it's not exactly a covered call, but it's a similar concept, which is here in excess P. This is just another example trade I wanted to share with you guys. We may or not have time for it, which is okay. But here's the punchline. This strategy as I have it on now, it's using short calls. And right now I'm short. Let's look at these. The Monday 549s. So let's pop over to excess P. X S P. And here's the deal. So like I said, I have the short 549s for Monday. So typically, what I'll do is I'll create an alert that is just below where my strike is. And you can always buy the shares as it gets close to your strike so that you can unwind the part of the position. You have to be careful with your accounting if it's life over 5.0. But that's a slick way to let your short calls get called away. And then just use new underlying that you accumulated to cover that. So that's one way you can defend the position. Another way you can defend the position is to roll the options. But it's really difficult on the call side because you have to get ready at some point to let it go. Because here's the deal. Every time you roll an option, you're realizing the P and L of the existing trade. So let me",

So in that video, it talks about the concepts of rolling. And here's another one there that is about some of the myths around rolling. A lot of people think it's like free money or a way to fix a trade. And it can help, but it can also hurt. It's actually one of the most annoying things I see. All the ceremonial wagons are going in right now for a Pahaska versus Poetan. But that's not what I'm here for. I'm here for to find. I was going to look up rolling options. So I want to give you example of like bad things. Okay. So and this isn't to talk smack about anybody to be clear, but like this, this video says avoid losses by rolling options. It's it's functionally not true. When you roll an option, especially if it's a losing trade, you're actually realizing a loss. So this is incorrect. This one says option rolling strategy is free money. If you think that there's free money in the stock market, that's grossly incorrect. This talks about",

You guys want to pick a stock? Pick a stock, any stock. Something with options though. We need something with options. And I can show you exactly what happens. GME. Let's do something else. GME, I'm always down, but we've done PLTR. That's cool. I just did another video on GME today. So I want to look at something else. Let's take a look at this good old PLTR. And let's zoom out. Let's find a good period to go back. Let's go here. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at rolling options in balance here. We'll use on-demand. We'll go back in time. And let's say that I use short calls. We'll do short calls. And let's say that we do it somewhere in here. So I'm going to enter a trade on the 29th of January. So we're going to pop into on-demand and we're going to go back to January 29th. Now to be clear, I'm cherry picking a scenario on purpose where I know that this is going to go up afterwards.

This is actually a really effective way to get a sense of how something works, both to the good side and the bad side. I find traders in general way too frequently, only focus on the side of the trade that they want to happen. And it's a massive mistake. It's literally one of the worst possible mistakes you can make. I call it, well, there's different ways you can refer to it. It's kind of like Goldilocks analysis. It's just, yeah, way too focused on what you want to happen. Okay. So let's say that we have shares. So we'll buy one Hyundai. Actually, let's talk about, we'll do one Hyundai for the example. We got a nice good old fill on our paper trading, which is great. And let's say that we go out like 30 days and we want to sell in at the money call, because that's where we get a bunch of money. That's what a lot of people do. And we'll click this. So we've just collected 135 bucks. Does the risk profile work in here? It does not wait. Does it? It does not. Summer. Well, if you guys are familiar with covered calls, the way that this risk profile would work is this line would go up until 17",

Well, if you guys are familiar with covered calls, the way that this risk profile would work is this line would go up until 17 right here. And then it would go completely flat. So rather than this upward sloping line, it would be zero slope straight this way like this. That's what it would be. So now let's fast forward. We'll go fast forward a week. Take it out. Maybe a little over a week. Come out here to five Feb. We gotta go a little further. Go to 12th. So what I'm doing is I'm finding the period in time where it starts to kind of accelerate boom. And we have the 17 strike. So we're way down here. So let's take a look at what rolling does. Florida kid says Robinhood shows risk potential beautifully. That's actually probably the last possible thing that that platform can do at all. I don't think Robinhood can do anything. Well, so I refute your point and my justification for refuting your point is nothing other than pure fiery hatred towards Robinhood. So that's the basis of my argument. It's pure reviewed.

And you'll see that the PNL on the stock is 8.11, but you're losing 606 on the call. So you've now assumed a position that has unlimited downside risk to zero. That you're taking that risk. You're holding that risk, but you've now capped the upside. And you have no more upside potential beyond 150. There's your max profit. That sucks. So now let's talk about this magic of rolling options. Let's talk about how rolling an option is free money and limited money. Let's check it out. I'm going to roll this option. The very first step to rolling the option is to close the existing one. So I'm going to have to close this for 8.10.

Because you're typically told, well, I can roll out. I'll be good or I can roll out and up and adjust my basis. Sometimes you can. There's nothing wrong with rolling. I roll literally all the time. The trade I was going to show you in XSP, I literally rolled it. The difference between my approach with options and other people, though, is that I'm not so egotistical that I have to have everything framed so that it works in my favor. I recognize when I roll this trade, I'm closing this 17 call out in one March for a loss. It is a realized loss on my books. It's a realized loss. My account value will have gone down by 661.50. Now, if you roll for a credit or let's say you can get to a credit, in this trade, you literally couldn't even roll",

That's the first part of a rolling transaction. It just happened. I just lost money. My account is now lower value than where I started.

I just closed these for, well, I guess, 7.98. So if this gives me the mid, then we'll be okay. You know what's bad when paper trading doesn't give you a fill. That's how you know your embed shape. Let's cancel this and let's see if we have to go to like a main expiration. Let's see what we can get for these 17s. We need to sell here. We should be able to get 825. This is a reasonable trade.

Let's see if this goes through. Boom. Tell you, you know your embed shape when you can't get a fill on paper trading. So we just got this for 825. So what just happened in the account? Simple. The net liquidating value decreased by the value of this option. It was already down, right? Realizing the trade doesn't all of a sudden make it happen. Your net liquidating value represents what happens if you close everything right now. So your net liquidating value was already down this 662. But now it's realized the position is closed. We opened up a new position. You just collected 8.25. This is a credit, which is good. It means that this position has the capability to cover the loss you realized on this position. But how much money are we actually making here? Well, if we're getting these optimal fills, which we know we wouldn't get in the real world, you're getting 25 cents plus what? Two cents, 26 cents is the overall credit that you got between this trade. So that means you got 26. And now you've tied this money up for 67 days. That doesn't seem like a great trade to me.

That doesn't seem like a great trade to me. I don't know. Maybe it is to somebody else. That's not great. I'm not trying to tie up the entire position on this, taking unlimited downside risk, having capped upside because I still don't have any upside profit potential beyond whatever the 150 it is less than that. So it's just not a great trade. So, but that's what rolling is. It's again, there's nothing wrong with it. The way that you reconcile rolling something like this to complete the example is let's say we fast forward time two weeks. The first thing I would be trying to do is roll is adjust this as soon as I could get out for reasonable profit, not even a profit necessarily on the entire transaction just on this individual trade and see if I can get just a little closer at the money. But what you're experiencing now is what I call expiration liquidity. Because guess what? I just fast forwarded two weeks and take a look. I can now roll these for a decent, this is great. In this position, I sold these for 825. I can buy them back for 695. This still doesn't cover the cost, but I could technically take these in for a small profit and then",

    "text": "weeks and take a look. I can now roll these for a decent, this is great. In this position, I sold these for 825. I can buy them back for 695. This still doesn't cover the cost, but I could technically take these in for a small profit and then try to roll to something that's a little closer to the money. But guess what? I don't have expiration liquidity. I have to go out now to 81 days if I want to roll this because I had to go so far out on the first trade in order to get a credit. This is the problem with rolling. So now we have to sit here and just hold this position. Now the other thing to keep in mind is you have to be very, very careful with the accounting because the position that you have on now this 17 call in 19 April will show a profit. It shows that you're making 130. But remember, this is a rolled position. You're still not making money in the aggregate. A lot of people get confused on that. So they think that their rolled option is now making money and it's like, oh, great. I make a money on this rolled option. Everything's going great. But you need to make 662 on this position before you're at break even let alone in profit on this new open position. So I'll take a pause there. See if you guys have any questions",

So the real instructor is now made it into the chat. It looks like you guys don't have any questions, which is good. So let's talk about how this eventually winds up. So in this position, if I have this trade, I essentially just need to wait until we get out here. So our expiration is 19 April. So literally, let's just go all the way to expiration here.

So now you have to roll it out another 60 days to potentially get your dollar. What you can here now finally. So now you have a choice. Do you roll your option out to this strike collecting about 3.55. You have to pay 3.40 essentially to close it. So you get 15 cents. That means over the course of essentially 120 days, you would have made what you got 25 cents on the first one",

You're getting 40 bucks to tie up this entire position and volunteer now for 120 days. That's what you have to show for it. But here's the thing with rolling. People are so egotistical that this idea of not having a losing trade is so important that they're willing to make the objectively ridiculous decision of tying up money for 120 plus days to make 40 extra on the premium here. It just doesn't make sense. Now the reconciliation is very simple though. If for whatever reason, let's say the example is you really do want to volunteer long term. Well, a bunch of things should be happening ready. You should have been buying more shares throughout this whole thing. That gets into a whole other strategy outline. But in this specific example, there's really two things we can do.

You can accept the fact that you made a terrible choice by selling a covered call. That's really what that boils down to. Otherwise, you could roll out another 63 days, adjust your basis slightly and continue the role, which you can do.

I don't know what it is about watermelon water. It's kind of refreshing. I was right about the doctor ordered. All right. So let me know if that makes sense on the rolling. I don't want to make it sound like I'm trashing rolling because I'm not. I roll all the time. But you have to understand the context of what you're doing and the trade-offs thereof. You can never get so obsessed with not being able to handle taking a losing trade that you just roll forever. It's so dumb. It's so egotistical. You can be in this game either because you have this strong urge to be right and your ego demands it. And for some people that can line up really well with making a lot of money. Again, there's always exceptions. But for most of us, that typically leads to losing a bunch of money. I always tell people do you want to be right or do you want to make money? I care about making money. So what that means is I am wrong all the freaking time. It's okay. That's how the business works. As long as you are able to constructively move through your process, you can be wrong all the time and still be okay. Santa Verre plane says, dude, yeah, he's",

Now he's rolled up like a little tiny ball down there. Policies the name rolling is a bit misleading. I don't know that it is. I feel like it's okay. What's wrong with rolling? You're just moving something further out in time. That seems legit to me. What's your beef with rolling? I feel like rolling is chill. I am in the process of finishing our door dash order. We're being unhealthy slabs tonight. We're going to do some buffalo wild wings. I don't know if you guys do boneless or not. I like them both, but boneless is just easier to eat because you can just kind of stuff them in your mouth. There we go. Jason says I'm rolling right now. How do boy? That's what we love to hear. My dude out here enjoying. Enjoying his Friday. Perfect. Good. All right. So it sounds like the rolling thing, which obviously was not the overall intention for the session today, but I think it's a great question and I'm happy, absolutely happy to dive into it.

Fan of Airplane says, wait, how can you lose money selling covered calls? I thought the worst case was selling your shares for the strike price. Yep. So the primary way that you can lose money selling covered calls is if your strike is below your basis. So if we go back to another example and let's go back to Teslux, we were just looking at this. So let's say that you were buying shares here, you get assigned or you were selling puts get assigned and then the underlying continues down, down, down, down, down. So your basis is way up here, but you're trying to sell calls against your shares in order to make a few bucks. So as you're doing that, you're selling your short calls lower than what your strike or than what your basis on the underlying is. That right there is how you can lose money doing this. So what that looks like is, let's say your basis is up here at 235, the underlying goes down, you're selling calls now all the way down here at 172, and sooner",

How close to the expiration is the latest I should wait to sell. And you have the 712 in GME. Let's take a look at 12. So the first thing here is I would generally recommend trying to stay out of the weeklies as much as you can because they're going to be less liquid. Now let's take a look at the 19 and a half. I like that these are in the money. That's good. But these are also very liquid. Right. And the reason why I'm saying that is they're 45 cents wide for something that's 19 and a half dollars. That's crazy liquid. So the way that I would measure this bit asked spread is I sent is essentially you can take the width between the bit asked spread and then divide it by the underlying price that kind of normalizes it. So in this case, the width is worth 45. You divide that or we could do .45 divided by 19.5. It's huge. It's literally huge. The spread. So in this case, I think these are just terribly liquid options. This is not good. So looking at when I think when really comes down to a couple things, how much you want to deal with the remaining extrinsic value. There's not that much. So what this means is each day that",

So what this means is each day that you hold these, you're not really bleeding a lot of money. That's a normal pretty significant input at this point. And other than that, it really you're so far in the money at this point, it doesn't matter. You can hold it for as long as you want. There's no set rule. I would focus more so not so much the time frame necessarily, but more based on what the underlying does against your expectations. That to me is what I would way more heavily wait than kind of an arbitrary time. Otherwise, the arbitrary time would definitely depend, depend quite a lot on how much data decay is coming out of them. But you're so far in the money that it doesn't matter.

And the reason why that scenario is terrible is for several reasons, but I think for that specifically, you would want to exit the position before expiration. That is the hands down correct answer in this scenario. Now let's say we're just talking about a hypothetical your broker could do you with solid and float you the shares on margin until you can sell it at market on Monday or if they can internalize the order and neutralize it for you and be homies, they can do that. Or you could technically give them instructions not to exercise, but you would lose all the money, which is a terrible idea. You do not do that. So the punchline to that is just close it before expiration. That's the easiest answer. Jay says, when you sell cover calls out a ratio, how do you balance downside protection with how much of a ratio you go for? Yeah, it's a great question. Here's the deal. When you sell covered calls or ratio covered calls, I would literally just not look at the short calls as downside protection. It protects so little it offsets your downside so insignificantly. So to me, I would literally just trade the chart as I typically would. So the way I would balance downside protection is let's take",

    "text": "covered calls, I would literally just not look at the short calls as downside protection. It protects so little it offsets your downside so insignificantly. So to me, I would literally just trade the chart as I typically would. So the way I would balance downside protection is let's take a look at XSP. I have a ratio called the Agnel, which is a very similar strategy is to cover call. I'm just using long options as compared to this case. Right now, I have a stop set. Oh, it's an alert, but it's an initial stop that's set at 540 91. So that means if XSP falls down to that, it means I'm going to exit the position. I will close the shares that I will close the calls. That's how I manage the downside risk is by managing the trade. The short calls offset such an insignificant amount of downside potential. I actually think it's really bad mental association to think selling more short calls helps with your downside. It doesn't actually help that much. I would just manage the trade. The short option part of that really just adds a little bit of premium to the position. So you can make a little bit more money. Re says broker will likely close the options before XSP if you don't have to cash the cover. Yep. And if you don't have margin because you can go on margin, right?

But yeah, Leonard says, what's the longest you've held an option before? That's a good question. I honestly don't know. I would have to imagine definitely over six months, but I'm not sure if I've actually held a single option for longer than a year without actively like moving the position. Let's see. I'm just catching up on the rest of the comments to make sure I didn't miss you guys. Good, good, good. Ruta Begis says selling calls is a bearish play. You should lose if the stock goes up. No, no, not not necessarily. So the reason why is because of an offsetting position. It's a great question, really, really great question. You're doing a good job analyzing it.

It might be a little too low. Let me see if I can put up just a little bit. So you'll see down here that the delta on this position, the long shares give me their one delta. Each share gives you one delta, right? Pretty easy. So if we have 100 shares, you have 100 deltas. The underlying when you sell calls will have less than 100 deltas. And then sooner or later, if you fall far enough in the money, they will essentially become also negative one delta. So then at some point, they offset one another for a one-for-one basis. So that's why you can sell calls against your shares and not have risk to the upside because the long shares offset the risk. I, J5D looks like you're bouncing great to see you. Take care.

When selling strangles, do you ever double down on the losing side or how do you defend it or adjust? That's a great question. That depends entirely on the trade. And that's all stuff that's defined ahead of time. There are some strategies that I run that are way more mechanical. So like anything zero DTE, two DTE, weekend plays, stuff like that. And in those instances, it's very programmatic. Once I hit a certain PL, I close the position, re-center it if I want, and then roll from there. It's essentially what I did today. There are other positions where I might be trading variants for premium, which I have a bunch of those plays on right now. I think one of them is an example on the on the blackboard. And those I'm more willing to adjust, but I typically will adjust before something goes way too far in the money. But the process of doubling down, I don't think that's a good idea. Now, that's not to say that you can't scale it into a trade if that's part of your plan, but the way that you're framing it tells me that we would be just scaling in because it's losing, and that's not a great reason to do that, in my opinion. So, no, I would",

So, no, I would pretty much avoid doubling down. The working investor, when selling covered calls below your basis, do we select a 16-deltar or less, so at least one standard deviation from the expected move? I would focus less on that, and I would focus more on where would you be okay fighting the position? That's what it comes down to. And the other thing is I would be very, very actively managing that position. As soon as it starts getting challenged, I would be trying to roll it out as little in time as I can and getting it as far out of the money as I can each time. The reason I go as little far out in time as I can, because sooner or later you run out of expiration liquidity. You're able to roll out seven days, then another seven days, then another seven days, then another seven days, and so on and so fun, until you get out here, and then it starts going from 49 to 84 to 112, it starts opening up a lot. So, I want to maximize my runway as best as I possibly can, so that's one of the broad ideas with that.",

So, I want to maximize my runway as best as I possibly can, so that's one of the broad ideas with that. So, yeah, I think the easiest answer in general is avoid doing it, avoid selling calls below your basis, because that tells you something has gone wrong, and in my opinion, where that would really become a scenario is when you're holding a stock too long, that's not doing what it should be doing. That's like the, I don't know the way I would think about it. That says when choosing to buy calls, am I correct that one of the things to look at is the IV and high IV is good, not necessarily. When choosing to buy calls, the primary profit mechanism is price direction. So, the main thing I would be looking at is something moving in your preferred direction, more than anything, much, much less so, about whether or not IV is high, IV in that scenario is kind of like a secondary function, I think. So, yeah, I think that's the way I think about that. Let me know if that answers your question. I'm updating. Quick.

Again, it's not about how much something is up or down, it's not about really any sort of arbitrary figures. When you're trading options in this scenario, Zack says that answers perfect. That's what we love to hear. When you're trading options directionally like this, at least for me, I'm trading a specific profit mechanism and then the option is just the vehicle. So, what that means is, let's say I'm trading, let's do like Wells Fargo. And let's say I'm trading leaps that I bought back in February or even better, January. So, let's say that I have really long dated options that are way, way out here. And let's say that I bought them with the expectation of Wells Fargo. Let's see what it would have looked like at the time. I'm just like picking an arbitrary place that I think I might have selected. So, we would have got it somewhere in here. Yeah, I would have no idea. There's nothing to look like it's been up here before. But let's just say that we pick a number. So, it's at 46.

    "text": "we would have got it somewhere in here. Yeah, I would have no idea. There's nothing to look like it's been up here before. But let's just say that we pick a number. So, it's at 46. Let's say that for whatever reason you think it's going to go to 55. And we'll draw a line here. 55. And let's zoom in. So, here, if we got in down here when it was at 46 for whatever reason and you think it's going to get to 55, what I would do in that scenario is in no way, say, okay, my long options are up. Let's call it 200. It's doing what I want. Let me close this position. What you're exhibiting in that scenario is a really well-known trader behavior shortfall. And it's a component of the disposition effect. It's where we have a strong mental preference, a cognitive preference, to close winning trades because we like that sensation. But we tend to close them too fast. And then we let losing trades run because we don't like the sensation of realizing loss. So, in this case, the way that I would think about it is not if my option is up X percent, if I'm trading long calls directionally, that's the only other reason to trade long calls is for a directional thesis. I'm going to craft my directional thesis first. The profit mechanism comes first, then the structure and strategy. So, if the profit mechanism is directionally",

No, not at all. That would not inherently be better. Mr. Ruta Begis, why do you think I say that? Why do you think it would not be inherently better? Any ideas? Or anybody else? There's a very specific reason. No guesses so far. That surprises me. Also, shout out to you guys. We have 60 people in here. I think this might be the biggest stream I've had.

You're focusing on the scenario that you like. So, talk to me about the bad scenario. When would this be bad? When when this hurts you? Jay says, if the underlying moves too far down, not necessarily, you would have the same downside risk as the long shares. Big A says, selling the put doesn't give the upside potential. That's way more close to being correct. There's a very specific reason. Think of it this way. What if we think Wells Fargo is going to go up and let's say in this scenario, there you go. Ruta Begis got it. If price goes up and I don't get anything, that's exactly right. So, this is the wait for a pullback thing. So, in this case, let's say that you think it's going to go up. You do all your analysis. You have a bullish thesis. So, you think you're going to be really slick and sell a put in order to acquire the position. What happens if it goes up? What happens if it does what you want? Well, now what? Do you wait? You made",

You've now placed a series of limited profit trades on a thesis that turned out to be correct and you have nothing to show for it because you were being too cheap and you didn't want to pay up for the position and you're trying to get it at a discount via short put premiums. Now, again, everything has a middle ground that doesn't mean it never makes sense to sell puts. But what it does mean is that if you're using cash-secured puts to acquire a position, you also should be ready to just buy shares outright when it makes sense. So, that's the way I would think about that. A fan of airplanes, it's a good question. Can't you collect premium immediately? Yeah, you collect a premium immediately, but it's tied to an open trade.

Let's get rid of these. Let's take a quick look at these other questions. I want to make sure that I have a chance to hit these. Uh-oh. We got to move these out here. Well, that's perfect for Pollock's. I think we spent a while talking about defending positions. That's perfect. The end of airplanes says, my thinking would be it only makes sense to sell puts if you think a price is going down. Well, why would that make sense? If price is going down, that's the wrong direction. If you're selling puts, it's a bullish trade. You want it to go up. So, why would you sell puts, which is a bullish position and want something to go up if something is going down? Now, over to this, to big K says, how do you find companies to trade options? Yeah. Well, you can scan. That's the easiest way. So, if you come in here and you look at different scans, you can look things that are optionable and have weaklies.

Some of them won't be liquid or whatever, but that's the easiest way is to start with scanning. Now, to the broader question I think you're asking is like, how do you find trades? That really comes down to what profit mechanism you're trying to transact against. And that's the very, very, very first step bar none. So, let me find a video for you on scanning for options trades. There you go. That video will go pretty far in a detail on that. Lord, it says people think it goes down. So, you sell the put because you know, it's going to go up or consolidating it at worst. Yeah, but again, the yeah, exactly. It's kind of a broken mindset. The Anavair plane says, my thinking that would make sense if you sell puts everything prices going down to acquire shares. The problem with that is again, why would you want to acquire shares and something that's going down? This again is kind of the propensity for our mind to try and focus on like the positive aspect",

This again is kind of the propensity for our mind to try and focus on like the positive aspect of something, but not the total aspect. Because in that scenario, could you sell a put that then you get assigned at and then something runs up and out and you got it at a great price? Sure, that could happen. But at the very base of things, why on earth would you want to acquire shares if they're going down? For me, it's a function of waiting until the shares are doing what I want them to then I will entertain entering a position whether it's to shorter to go long. But there's no reason to try to get in while it's moving because we think that it's kind of smart or slick or like a way to be cheaper. I just think that you end up losing way more money that way. Rudevega says, very informative. I'm glad I found the channel. That's awesome. Yeah. The thing is is I know what I know, right? Like I know my skill set and I know that a lot of retail traders struggle.

Let me grab a link to it. I think this one only lasts for like seven days. But yeah, come on in if you want to hang out and chat more options. We're always here. All right, let's get to this one. Do a tutorial about bold put spreads and call debit spreads. How to find the entry and exit point and how to select strikes DTE. Yeah. So actually I would not do this personally. I would not trade these spreads. But the short answer to this is actually quite simple. To find the entry is entirely dependent again on the profit mechanism. You have to start with the profit mechanism. Traders make the same mistake all the time. They're worried about all of these ancillary details. But again, the entry and exit point is not based on the options. It's based on the underlying theme and the disposition towards the underlying. So that's the first part. Then selection of strikes",

And then days expiration again comes down to that standard selection process based on the balance of how long you want to trade open, how much money that you will collect in this case for the bold put spread. The call debit spread is kind of inverse of that because we're paying. So then this comes down to how much theta do you want to decay out? Stuff like that. You long sons.

That's the profit mechanism. So whatever that condition is that yields profit is the profit mechanism. So a simple profit mechanism. If you want something to go up, that's a profit mechanism. Something goes down. That's a profit mechanism. Implied volatility trending over realized volatility. Variant source premium. That's a profit mechanism. Momentum premium. That's a profit mechanism. All these different things that actually yield profit is the profit mechanism. Options and then the various structures and strategies. Those are simply how we're attempting to capture the profit mechanism. So if you're trading again, for example, let's take a look at one of these. I have a bunch of these on right now. Well, we have this one on right now. BYD. I'm trading a variance risk premium play in here, which means I'm trading the persistence of implied volatility over realized volatility. Why am I doing that? Very, very simple because implied volatility continues to trend a lot over realized volatility. So what is my profit mechanism? Variant risk premiums. That's how this trade makes money. How do I capitalize on that? I can trade short straddles. I can trade short strangles. I can trade iron butterflies. I can",

Those are all different ways I can capitalize on the profit mechanism. But the mechanism is that in and of itself. Elon Slong says so it's the root of your thesis. Yeah, I think that's a fair way to think about it. I think the way I would define it is it's the modality whatever your thesis is. It's the modality that your thesis makes money through. So you can have a thesis that a stock is going to go up down sideways or whatever. But whatever you think will lead to profit or what is the actual function that leads to profit is what I would consider the profit mechanism. That's a good question. All right, so let's take a look at a few things. We actually talked about option liquidity. We already talked about expiration liquidity. When we talk about expiration volatility, when we're talking about volatility with options, there are really a bunch of different kinds. We talked about that in a bunch of the earlier videos.

So I want to focus a little bit more on these different volatilities for explorations and what that can mean. So as we know, implied volatility is forward looking. And we know that it's tied to a specific time frame. So as things have different amounts of time to work, we tend to expect larger moves over that time frame. But you'll notice interestingly enough that you can have things that are further out in time that have a bigger expected move than something that has higher implied volatility. Right? So in this case, this is 140 DTE or something like that or 49. Maybe this is the 140. And the IV here is 133 with a 5.5 dollar expected move. But if we go further out, this is a 16 dollar expected move, but this is only 115 vol. Why? Anybody have any ideas? Why that would be the case. Think about what volatility measures. It's variance over time. So in this case, when we look at this, this is expecting relative to this time frame, a bigger move relative to the time frame. That's why you will see expiration volatility move like that. Now you can use this for a lot of things. It's very informative. You can trade the difference between these different expiration cycles.

You can trade the difference between these different expiration cycles. Rudebeggus says more time close, but it's kind of it's not just that, right? Because if this has more time and this has a bigger expected move, FantaVarePlan says maybe you're getting this now, but would love an overview of how to evaluate options potential upside. That's probably better suited for the first or second video in this series. We went through basic option structures that talk about the upside potential. So I think that would be a good place for you to start if you haven't seen those. Alan says better chance of something that's going to happen. Yeah, so you guys are correct in terms of your perception of the implied move as a dollar amount. So in this case, we can see that the dollar move here is 16. It has more time to move. What I'm highlighting though is that there are shorter duration trades that have a smaller implied move as a dollar amount, but a bigger IV meaning implied volatility. Again, so here, the expected move is only 2.73 out here at 16. But out here implied volatility is 115 and here it's all the way up to 139.5. So this is because of what I was talking about, the expected move",

    "text": "amount, but a bigger IV meaning implied volatility. Again, so here, the expected move is only 2.73 out here at 16. But out here implied volatility is 115 and here it's all the way up to 139.5. So this is because of what I was talking about, the expected move against a relative time frame. That's why you guys are absolutely right. We expect things to have a wider range the further out you go, but implied volatility is relative to time frames. This is the problem. This is why that is. Ruin Titty says the less people trading it longer out. That's part of it, but that's not the nut shell of it. What again, what this means is that out here, even though it's really long duration, this has a smaller relative range to this time frame. That's all. So we can use these expiration cycles a hunt for different opportunities. We can look for periods where this is at 234. This one's down at 112. This one's at 100. This one's at 117. So once you develop relationships with products and models, you can trade the relative volatility of different time frames. You can also look for events that are coming up. Why does this go from 100 to 117 back down to 102? Why is that? Typically, that means that there's some sort of announcement coming out, some sort of news release could be earnings. Earnings in here is not until the 5th of August. So",

Typically, that means that there's some sort of announcement coming out, some sort of news release could be earnings. Earnings in here is not until the 5th of August. So it's something else that's doing it. I just don't know what. But if we keep going out, we now know that earnings in the 5th of August, but let's take a look at the expiration cycles that capture that. Notice how implied volatility goes from 90 to 140. This is clearly a massive expansion in volatility. And it's because this expiration cycle encapsulates that earnings release. So you can learn a lot by looking at just this. The other thing you can do is plot the implied volatility. I like to use out of the money options. Jason says this volatility correlate with liquidity, definitely. So volatility has an impact on liquidity. You need enough volatility for a market to be active. But if you have a market that has too much volatility, it decreases liquidity. So there's definitely a relationship between those high volatility actually becomes kind of like a natural stock market circuit breaker. Spreads get really, really wide when volatility comes in super high. Sunny says, BYND is a meme play by the way. I don't understand. What do you mean for what? For this? And so anyways, you can also look at a volatility smile down",

Now this will be a little confusing because they're all squished down. But essentially, this is just looking at the implied volatility for all of the out of the money options. This gives us an idea of if the market is pricing in things to the downside, to the upside. Sunny says a lot of hype for another squeeze play soon. Oh, I see. Yeah, I think the problem honestly with those kinds of things to be honest is like, you have to be careful with at least for me, I trade things as they are. The theories and stuff like that I find really interesting, but they're not bullet proof, unfortunately. So like this week originally was supposed to be some sort of big massive week and it turned out to be absolutely nothing. So I think squeezes are interesting, but the way that I trade them is when they're happening. I'm not trying to front run them personally and it's because I know that I can't time them that well.

But anyways, back to the volatility smile, where we see higher implied volatility is where the market is pricing in movement. That's the way to think about that. There's a lot of different ways that you can navigate through this options chain and learn all different kinds of things. If you look through the recent series I've been doing on the daily with things like GameStop, you actually have a pretty cool visual of me applying a lot of this analysis. Let me grab the playlist to that. Actually, I just grabbed the most recent video. I think they're all linked in there. This one, this one's this one's pretty good. This one's talking about Chewie and GameStop because some interesting activity between both of those actually. All right. Peter says don't think Eric is playing Squeeze, VRP. Yep, that's exactly right. In BY and D, at least. Because I can for for my visual, I can see a very clear, persistent, high elevated implied volatility relative to realized. So that's literally all I'm trading. If there's some sort of squeeze between these cycles, which you can see them like it's a thing, but this",

If there's some sort of squeeze between these cycles, which you can see them like it's a thing, but this one was tied to earnings. And then this one came not so different after earnings slightly different. So this one's a little more anomalous, I think. But yeah, even these squeezes, which is funny for my style strategies, it wouldn't even hurt me in these products. And it's because there's so much volatility. Right. You can see where my stop is up to the upside, 867. So even if we get one of these squeezes from a relative basis, which here, it's essentially a full point higher. So this squeeze, you can move it down from 878 down to 778 on a relative basis. And it would still be well within my range. So yeah, this is just very interesting. I'm looking at K. R.

But it's also not necessarily this evil place. Although it is absolutely too obscure in my opinion. Like I think the fact that it's not as transparent, I don't like that. But I also understand and recognize the impact it has on market liquidity and stability, which is a thing. So all I'm trying to highlight there is it's not all bad. A lot of people want to demonize something. And it has a lot of bad aspects. As I mentioned, I'm not a giant fan. I would love some pretty significant reform of them. But they're not all bad. Rointitdy says it suppresses prices. It does. It absolutely does not help with price discovery. But if you're looking at when price discovery occurs, it is on lit exchanges. And if you compare where the dark pools are transacting at, it's typically not at super advantageous prices relative to market price. So I agree with you. It's not helping with price discovery. But it's also not this place where people are getting crazy, great steels on every single trade they put out. It's yeah, I think the other thing to keep in mind is giant block orders can be really difficult to move. And they can really hurt liquidity to some degrees. So I think by decreasing some of that, there is a",

So let's take a look at Apple. Like they you see what I mean, they didn't get some steel of a price. It came in at a dollar over where it's at now. Now they might have moved the market. I don't actually don't think for a trade that size. It's not even that big of a trade. I don't think for a trade that size that it would have moved too much. But that's not like some sort of super advantageous position for them. The main thing is they got liquidity. That's the thing. So yeah, it's it's important again, it's important to be aware of dark pools, how they behave, how they transact.

Yep, I have a video on it for you. It's not that important is what it boils down to. It's again, it's another example where retail traders are kind of trying to find a bogeyman. And again, it does happen. I do think that there is a level of market manipulation of prices very close to things. But market makers overall are at the behest of order flow. So they can influence pricing. They cannot drive pricing all over the place. Because if persistent order flow comes in in a specific direction, they literally are slaved to it. They can't they can't change it. There's subject to order flow. So that video there is about max pain. Peter is laughing because I use the video game cover in the title, because I thought it was hilarious. But yeah, so max pain is a tendency or this theory that people think that market makers manipulate markets",

But yeah, so max pain is a tendency or this theory that people think that market makers manipulate markets as it gets closer to wherever the highest dollar value of options will expire worthless. So you can take a look at, John says, yeah, exactly what I was thinking, market makers to have premium expire worth is yeah, they're going to make their money. That's the thing. They have essentially a way provided that they manage their book well. They capture the bit asked spread. They have their money. So they can be super greedy and they can be fucked up. Like no doubt about any of that. But all I'm saying is that some people they'll look at price and they'll be like, oh, well, it was max pain. It was all market manipulation. And it's like, dog, the stock was like 5 away from what you were trying to get it to. Like that doesn't really matter. So yeah, there's an element of it though, I think. I absolutely think that let's say, for example, Apple 21062, let's say it was a smaller stock, really difficult to do in like these really, really big floating stocks. But let's say that it was like 2 2 10 99. And let's say that there was a ton of overall",

Brad Dricol, can you look at snap? I can do that on Monday. I want to get through the more substantive questions first. Shinsasu says, isn't it like a moving average? I don't remember which part we were talking about, like a moving average. Let me know what that was referring to. Rudebegus says, when I buy options, it tells me the probability of profit is that reliable. Yeah, it's using options data as it is. It's misleading. People get really confused about that. Because the probability of everything changes essentially as soon as time changes. It's a time series. So if we look at IWM, we all know we got to look at some IWM. And I look out here, and I see the probability, which is this one, there's probability of being in the money at expiration and a probability of touch. Right? So let's just use this example.

    "text": "we got to look at some IWM. And I look out here, and I see the probability, which is this one, there's probability of being in the money at expiration and a probability of touch. Right? So let's just use this example. Let's say that we're looking at this 30 delta probability of in the money is 28.57. Probability of touch is 55.75. Now let's say that it's the same day in IWM rallies. And let's say that we go from pretend that IWM goes up five points. So that would mean that at the money's, our strike would now look like this strike. It would behave like these 203s. It would be 208 instead, but it would look like these. Now take a look at the probabilities. The probability of it being in the money is 51. The probability of it touching and falling in the money temporarily is 99. So the probabilities move is what this means. So yes, at the time of entry, the probability is whatever it tells you it is, but the probabilities will move. They're adaptive. They're based on a time series. They're not discrete. A Florida kid says those probabilities are predictions. Not definitely careful. Well, it's important, right? That's what probabilities are. It's an assessment. But the reason why it's not definite is because they change as the underlying changes. Alan says so market makers can do what they want, so why play options? It's because they're not out to get you.",

The vast majority of the time, I know people really try to dig down at market makers, but the vast majority of them are providing liquidity to capture the bid-ask spread. There's always bad actors and just about everything, but they can't do whatever they want. That's actually my previous point. They're subject to order flow. They can't move price wherever they want it to go, otherwise nobody would play in the markets for that exact reason. But we know that they can't. Does that mean that they can't slightly manipulate things? I bet they could. I can't prove it, but I bet they could. There's a lot of studies out there on it that try to prove it, but it's still inconclusive technically speaking from a definitive standpoint. It's one of those things where could it happen? Absolutely. It would be ignorant to pretend that it couldn't happen. Do they have incentive to do it? Absolutely.

I don't think so. My guess is for these super far out of the money contracts is I think that it's a bunch of retail traders that are making really bad choices.

This is just going to take a minute to load because it's not small. That's what I tell everybody. So if we untick this, oops, that's not what I wanted. So this is just raw options data from today. So I typically clean it like that. And then for you guys, I create these little visuals so that we can see what transactions happen when and where. Again, this is kind of what I like to do. But something like unusual whales is pretty convenient because it offers a bigger view. The other thing I like to do is just aggregate the bigger things from TNS.

Even this, like this is still, well, even more interesting, these are sale trades, right? Because these are coming in at the bid. So let's get rid of mid and bid and this. And let's like just look at the offer. So we know that these are buys. Look at all these small, tiny trades. This is just people hoping something works. That's what it comes down to.
