    "text": "What's up, outliers? Somebody sent this over asking, what is this new income generation GameStop ETF? So that's what we're going to take a look at. It's really nothing that complex, but as I promised, I will look and let's start here. What is this fund? Well, it's really simple. Funds like this exist already. If you take a look at something like JP Morgan, they have JEPI or JEPI, JEPQ. And these are different kind of funds where they typically will hold either a basket of stocks or a basket of synthetic long positions. And then those sell calls against it. The whole idea is to try to capture volatility so that you can hold the base position, but then also make some money in the near term against it. So this is just professional level, quote unquote, covered call trading of different capacity. So if we take a look at GameStop's version of this through IGME, there's a couple things that stick out to me. One of them, the nav is actually like really small still once you get into the actual assets. And it looks pretty new, but this I thought was actually quite interesting. Because right now, the way that they're doing this is actually through leverage. So you'll notice that there's actually no holding of the equity outright. I do find that curious. Now, a big reason why they're not is because it is cheaper to buy or in this case, they're actually creating these",

Now, a big reason why they're not is because it is cheaper to buy or in this case, they're actually creating these because if you notice 2301, you won't see that on the open market. So these are actually creations through a flex. So pull other process doesn't apply here, but what they're doing is gaining leverage. And I'll show you how I got my notepad. Let's take a look. So let's just use these for an example because these were long calls. We can figure out what the current value is. We don't know what they bought them for, but effectively they have 351 contracts. So this is the equivalent as always options. They deal in 100 lot instances. So really what they're holding is the equivalent of 35,100 shares. So if we were to buy those 35,100 shares at the stock price of 23, it'll be way more expensive than what they got the same exposure for. Because these 351 contracts right now, they're worth 1.81. So if we do the math on this, and we figure out how much they might have paid outright for those 351 contracts. Again, we don't know what the original position was, but you can see the current market value there is 63,000. Then if we take 35,100 times 23.01, that would be 800",

So this is the leverage that they're gaining. You notice how they're controlling the same size position, except they're using something around this amount of money. Again, we don't know what their actual entry was, whereas if they were to buy the shares, it would cost them this much. So this is very similar actually to my ratio called diagonal strategy. Now the difference is they are not trading it at a ratio. And the reason is because they're focusing on the income. So it's funny because when I saw this post originally, the poster was saying that it was kind of laughable or somebody to take hold game stop and give up the upside risk. But there's actually a really tactical reason why they're doing this. Now a couple of other questions people might have again are like, what are these paired with? So that's actually one of the reasons why sometimes you'll see these penny increments is it'll actually logically show you what it's paired with. And it'll mirror the O1 on the tail so that you can see what they're tying to what. Anyways, the other thing you'll notice is that there's actually short puts",

This is really important because if they did not have these short puts, they would actually have upside risk, which I originally thought they had because that would be crazy. And I'll show you what the position looks like with this entire portfolio looks like. So if we get rid of that, we go over to the analyze tab. This is what their position looks like right now today. So I've included all of the individual legs that they have some of these down here are unchecked because there are existing stuff that don't apply here. This is the position. So what they're looking to do as you can tell is sacrifice the upside profit potential to take in all of the existing volatility. And for a lot of GameStop, ape, like true holdholders, this will seem crazy. But the reality is the frequency that we see squeezes is infrequent enough that you can make a lot of money doing something like this playing on the natural volatility and movement of GameStop compared to other stuff. Great example of this is if you take a look at the volume here, it's 73.56. The implied volatility percentile, which ranks",

Great example of this is if you take a look at the volume here, it's 73.56. The implied volatility percentile, which ranks how high that is is literally at 4. That means only 4 of instances have evolved that's lower than what we're seeing right now, which is crazy. It means that volatility on a relative level right now is super low. Yet it's still all the way up at 73.56. And this is a very liquid stock. For context, if we take a look at Pfizer, just throw a names out, their volume is 29.8. Take a look at their implied volatility percentile, 50. So it means half the time it's higher, half the time it's lower. Again, going back to GameStop, not even close. This is about as low as it goes. Then if we look at something like Apple, their vaults 29.8 imply volatility percentile 62. Okay. Now you might be thinking, well, these aren't really volatile names. So what about something that's typically jacked to the tits like Tesla 68 vol. Their 68 vol has an implied volatility percentile of 54, which means that this is pretty high. Whereas if we go back to GameStop, which still has a higher raw vault than everything else, but an insanely low imply volatility percentile, which again, means that volatility tends",

And I kind of poke through their filing documents to see, like I said, their fees are high for what this thing is. You're a point 98. That's not like crazy for industry, but just higher. And actually that this confirms what I thought. It says it will invest in traditional exchange traded option contracts and flex exchange, which reflects options like I was referring to earlier using GameStop as a reference asset. This is a benefit of institutional levels. They can create things that fit their need. Now that doesn't a lot of people will jump at that and think like there's a lot of nefarious undertones going on here because I know that GameStop is riddled with that.

This is very, very common because again, there's a lot of regulation that applies to these kinds of assets compared to other stuff, especially when you're creating synthetic positions. You have to have clear pairings for the synthetic positions because otherwise your risk reward can really go out of whack super fast. A good example of this I'll show you. If we go back into what the fun looks like right now and let's get rid of the short puts that are at the very bottom. Notice what happens. They get smashed to the upside if they don't have these short put pairings in order to take up this risk. If we take off even the smaller one, notice how they eventually have upside risk. They don't want that. What they want is to have that capped upside to be able to take the premium in. So really, really common. This is not unique to GameStop. Again, Jepi, Jepq will use different kinds of versions of these very same things. Like if we go into Jepq and let's just take a quick look at what their holdings are. You'll notice it's a bunch of stock upfront, but if you click in, I fully expect to see some synthetics. So let's zoom in. Physical physical. So these are all regular stock and here you go.

    "text": "what their holdings are. You'll notice it's a bunch of stock upfront, but if you click in, I fully expect to see some synthetics. So let's zoom in. Physical physical. So these are all regular stock and here you go. Equity, link, note, synthetic positions. And this is super common. This is how big institutions can use the money that they have to gain efficiencies. Now it does look like they're looking to cap their risk. So they don't want to have that upside risk, which is a really, really important note. I think upside risk in GameStop is suicide, especially at the institutional level that has a lot of various mandates. But it's an interesting thing. It is absolutely not anything I would ever even consider touching. It is easier to make these kinds of positions on your own much more cheaply, but nonetheless, it's an out of the box thing for again simplicity. So as always, if you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. See you guys later.",
