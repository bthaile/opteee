    "text": "I bit versus bit. Oh, what is the better bit coin ETF and the answer is actually really, really simple. It's I bit hands down. The big difference between I bit and bit. Oh, is what they do. I bit holds actual bit coin. Bit oh trades bit coin futures. They use the spot futures to create the positioning. This doesn't include the differences between expenses and expense ratios, which is much cheaper in I bit or the assets under management, which is much higher under I bit. But just take a look at the year-to-date performance for an example. If we take a look over the essentially trading years so far, you'll see that I bit is down 1.42. So not stellar year, but you know, I'm not really doing a whole lot. If we compare that to bit oh down 12.12 why it's because it's way more expensive to trade a spot futures position and in this case with the way that the market is going that's disadvantageously impacting this. So I trade I bit. This is actually what I'm trading. The coverage triangle in and providing you all updates on. So this is where I go. Curious what you think. Being on our sale later.",
