So when we're going through our trading career and thinking about what we aspire to, this is why I genuinely believe the only worthwhile benchmark for what you try to emulate and what you try to be is a better version of yourself. If there's ever a point in your trading career or really in life, this is sometimes my wife will do this sometimes and it drives me fucking crazy. Because she'll say like, oh, it's much better than blank or I'm not as bad as blank. Or whatever it is about blank, right? As like the benchmark comparison. And I always remind her and I always remind you guys, I couldn't literally possibly care less what the average benchmark is. I couldn't care less. It makes no difference to me.

That's not the field we operate in our community. It is completely superfluous beyond having it as a benchmark because you do need to understand what average is. That's just a general understanding of the landscape. But when we're creating benchmarks in terms of performance aspirations, that ain't it. That is not it. Because when we go through something like a trading career, we've already talked about this. In order to be successful, you already know you have to functionally be an outlier. You have to be a statistical anomaly. In order to be successful in trading longterm, it is quite literally a requirement. Now, again, we've done this similar study before where if you think about the average trader and what the average person's path looks like, it's no wonder why the failure rate for trading is so astronomically high. Think of what the average person does when they try to start trading. They think that they're gonna make a bunch of money super fast without risk. They're gonna turn their 500 into a few million dollars, cheap, easy, all those other buzzwords. And no shit that most of them fail.

It's going to tell you, but most people are too concerned about protecting the ego because the ego doesn't like being challenged. The ego gets uncomfortable if it's confronted, if somebody or something tells you you're wrong. This is a reason why most people don't like having trade logs is because it forces them to confront the reality of their strategy and their positions. People hate that and it's why they don't do it. It's literally why they don't do it. But if the goal is to try and do this and make meaningful amounts of money, it's what needs to be done.

So this is a post I put earlier, long story short, Cliff Notes version for this post. I was talking to my mom on the phone earlier. She said that she was waking up kind of achy and then I was asking her about the conditions around that and she said, oh, well, I think my bed is like a divot in it, so the fucking mattress is old. While I was on the phone with her, I was just like, oh, we need to fix this. And I essentially go out and I find a, oh, thank you, Mr. Igor, great heads up. I find a mattress that I could get to her that I like because we use the satva mattress. We have a different one than this, but, the main point is that through trading and through investing, I've gotten to a point where I can essentially identify something I care about, spend very little time, like this purchase was made in 30 seconds from the time, literally from the time of her telling me.

And it's gonna be a continual process of making really, really thorough, tough analysis of yourself and making yourself better.

It really is entirely doable. I think I generally embody some elements of that, right? Because I am not a genius. I genuinely am not. Like I am a fucking hyper normal person.

It takes time to get to that level of understanding. It's not easy to piece together, I think, for a lot of people. So it's doable. It's not easy. It's simple, which is the beautiful part, but simple doesn't mean easy. So that Lawrence is being wrong all the time, makes it super exciting when I'm right. See, but that's also a problem, Lauren. You already know. Lauren, damn it, Lauren. You're the first fucking name I see in the chat, and then I already got to start tearing in to some shit. Sorry, Lauren. The problem, what, you guys tell me, what's the problem? What issue do I have with what Lauren just said? You guys already know, you guys already know that I have a problem with that probably. So what do you think my, my ish is no feelings at law at all, no feelings at law at",

So what do you think my, my ish is no feelings at law at all, no feelings at law at all, Lauren, that's not it either. Reese is not correct. Tommy says exciting is the issue. That's correct. That's exactly correct. Lauren says, that's okay. I'll cry to my long legs. Well, I think by the time your, your tears finish flowing, they would probably evaporate after, you know, expanding the surface area of your legs. But the recess hyperbole hyperbole is fine, but again, like people think that, people genuinely think that the target is to have no feelings and that's not accurate. It's genuinely not accurate. So the reason is because it's completely unobtainable. But what Tommy said is exactly correct. Exciting. So Lauren, from your perspective, why do you think that I take issue with the concept of exciting? Why do you think that I specifically call that out for you? Exciting. There's two reasons. And you already know, all right, thank God. My watch is finished charging. So I have this, I use my Garmin dive watches like my daily watch, just because I don't like changing it. And part of my OCD is making sure that it's charged, obviously. But then it feels super weird when it's not on my wrist. That Lauren says exciting",

But then it feels super weird when it's not on my wrist. That Lauren says exciting is not calculated. That's one of the issues. There's two main things that I want to talk about with this concept of excitement. Let me see if I can get my little marker up here. Okay, so, trader, I guess there's two hours in trader. Trader feelings. Cyteman. So in this context, something like excitement means happy. Affirmed. I don't know what else you would joyous maybe. It's just kind of a synonym for happy. But the really the thing I'm trying to highlight is that there's obviously a feeling of elation to a degree. And then there's a feeling of affirmation here. So these feelings exactly as you guys point out to the first component, which Lauren highlights is excited. Alters. Decision making. That's problem one. There's actually a second and a bigger problem here. So this is the first problem. What's the second problem that you think I have here? There you go. Lauren is actually talking about it right now. If you guys can see, Reese says if we're too excited, we'll be too disheartened if it doesn't go our way, right? So then we'll obviously go through the the ebb and flow. We'll have the general",

And what I try to describe to you guys is like the outlier emotional cycle, as I call it. Should be more like this. And well, let's just call this like the midline. Sorry. Something like that. So this is obviously happy. This is sad. So this is the standard cycle for a lot of people. And my argument for outlier trading. Is it should look like this. So the ideas were dampening. We're dampening our emotional response. For those that don't know, when you have an emotional response to something, and it's a response, just get rid of the word emotional. When you respond to something, there are a series of biological and physiological effects that occur. Some of them are mental. Some of them literally are chemical. Right. So think of it if you consider when you get excited. Typically your heart rate will pick up a little bit. Typically your attention will pick up a little bit. Typically your eyes will open up a little bit more. Right. You're trying to take in more information,",

The issue with this is these two go together. Happiness and sadness. If you experience big happiness, you're going to experience big sadness. That doesn't mean that you can experience. You don't have you shouldn't experience happiness. You obviously should. But it should be tempered. Now, this second part is even more important than this first part in my opinion. Part do. Do.

So Lauren, based on your last comment, what's the second thing that I'm highlighting here? So I gave you the first error with excitement. The first error with excitement is that it alters your decision making, and then you're going to send yourself down the emotional path. One, dough, Troy. But how do you say dough? Is it dough?

That's not it good guesses, but that's not it I want you to think about I want you to think about this You What happens in this path If you're trading a system and then you have two losing trades in a row and then you have your winning trade Between this you you start off. You're like add that kind of sucks Okay, this isn't going super great. I hope the next one works. Ah great. Yes. This one worked. This is perfect Awesome. So now let's build this out into a longer series of trades The reason why excitement Becomes a problem TCM king is very close The reason why excitement is the problem is because it's literally It's a misaligned trade expectation We're focusing on the wrong thing What I mean by this is whether or not you have a trade that's a winning position or a losing position Genuinely Should not move you much one way or the other Genuinely, it should not move you much The reason why",

There's some traders who are drastically motivated by that The problem though is that it's emphasizing the wrong aspect of a successful trade Right, so for me I would consider a successful trade To be something where I'm executing a defined and researched strategy That I know is positively expectant in the long run That's what I care about So if that includes taking losing trades in pursuit of the winning trades, that's okay It obviously needs to make money to make sense But the main thing is to not have misaligned incentives for your trades The incentive for the trade should be the deployment of a positively expectant strategy It shouldn't be for entertainment for excitement for thrills You can",

I'll give you a quick scenario based on something like theta Let's say that We analyze the market whatever and we're looking through our portfolio and we find that we're short theta Depending on what you think about the market how you manage your portfolio for me.

It doesn't fit your risk profile now let's just assume That either one of these was fine that you don't actually care And that you can go up to five percent for example, which I would argue is way too large to be clear on a hundred thousand dollar portfolio of five thousand dollar drawdown Is likely too big and I'm actually going to show you why It's probably too big So the next step here is we actually have to assign probabilities to this So what's the probability?

It's probably too much It's We're talking about something that's super volatile So then what can we do here to remodel this Well We can take a look either at a different analysis But we shouldn't go back and overfit our analysis because we don't like this number. That's not the right answer So what we need to do is figure out how can we decrease The risk Here and here For the short put or the long call So we need to go back And we need to figure it out so we can say If instead of going 91 days to the 67 delta Maybe we go further out of the money On the calls And we say what would this be worth at 362 All of a sudden this becomes 3800 We're starting to move in the correct direction by going further out Of the money. It's still a relatively high delta So Then we can add",

Let's see actually Any of these that like genuinely look okay This is a 39 delta with 1672 OI So this is okay This loses three grand so it still would be a little bit too much So you might have to include Another element to this trade you can restructure the trade a few different ways So we can look at Doing something like this again. So we have the four forties Which are like a 60 delta But then maybe we come in here to the 60s And We sell The 890s And we create a diagonal Which would look like this And we can do it off of either of these we could do it off of this or this So notice on this trade here We essentially Cut our risk now down to 23 hundred bucks But we still have Significant upside profit potential it can go too far you do have to manage the trade But this is easy to deal with This is a way that you can also reduce your risk I'm giving you",

It's not about just picking Oh, I want to buy or oh, I want to sell It's not based on that at all the decision is effectively made for us As we look at these different criteria. That's the idea here So now Black says examples are going to reflect at expiration or zero That's incorrect because you notice how the example that I'm giving you here has too long We have the purple line which actually represents today And then we have seven December which represents at expiration for the near term option So the example here doesn't actually Reflect at expiration it actually reflects today, which is why it's a good example So Back to the analysis though because we also identified that selling this putt was a little bit too much right to grand Don't really love that Still too big of a loss so then what can we do?
