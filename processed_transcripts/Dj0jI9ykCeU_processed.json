    "text": "What's up outliers? Quick general market update. Then I want to talk about P and W and then we'll take a look at GameStop. So let's get right into it. What happened today? Well, a slight down day, the first one that we've seen in a little while now for the SP 500 for the cues and for the Russell, it's still the weakest of the bunch by far. So I'm seeing a few things is you could tell the red volume, which is the sale volume is definitely ticking up here and we're still seeing volume contracting. So what's to be derived from that as per usual, don't know just yet, but it is kind of confirmation to me that this isn't necessarily a straight V-shape recovery from low to high. Does this mean that we start transacting sideways a little bit that would not surprise me at all. And it's because as you can tell for specifically the cues, we've just bumped into the point of control. A lot of people are wanting to transact there for something like the Russell, it just can't catch a big bit. It is struggling here. And we still have the SP 500 outperforming to the upside. So the other thing I notice from a broader perspective is the various premiums here have been contracting pretty meaningfully, interestingly enough for the 30 day vols in the SP 500, which I find curious, but it's not surprising with the VX being so suppressed",

It did catch a little bit of a bid today. So I'm already out of my fade VIX position and I'm reloaded always looking to get back into that as soon as the time looks good, but right now VIX is so low, this is not somewhere that I personally would look to fade it. So broad market fascinating what's going on here it's still making this really aggressive recovery. We're seeing net highs lows for the NASDAQ turning positive and maintaining positive, whereas for IWM they've been positive for a while and we're just not seeing the strong continuation that's being seen in large cap stocks. So right now I'm still position long market in general and I have both long futures in the E-minis and then I still have the T-Triple Q's position that I'm actually starting to pair down and that position will morph a little bit likely rotate that into NASDAQ futures in the not so distant future.

The reason why I'm using the three times is because when you get these really strong persistent one day one directional moves that compounding of a three times daily return is actually pretty lucrative, but for general carry positions futures or the indices themselves are typically fairly effective. So I'm agnostic to which of those all end up rotating into, but for something like T-Triple Q's I've no problem holding it for some time, but it's not something that I would just close my eyes and hold forever. And it's just because I'm not really interested in going through the full cycle that I can present to you, which can be pretty nasty. Even recently it's gone from 85 down to 48. Just a big move and unfortunately there's no tax advantage for something like T-Triple Q's whereas if you're trading the indices themselves, which the NASDAQ index is super illiquid the option so I don't trade that. But the NASDAQ futures are kind of the next best choice there so that's probably what I will rotate into. So now let's take a quick look at just the market events for today because not a ton went down the 20th was really quiet. We had a couple Fed speakers tomorrow is when it starts to go a little more interesting. So we have the Fed meeting minutes, which I think is going to be a slightly bigger",

Now the other thing I wanted to pull up really quick is P-A-N-W and Paul also networks just had a banger of an earnings. It was estimated at 0.768 came in at 151 moderate gap up but a big up move on the day. So this starts to look attractive from a post earnings announcement drift style play to the upside. So I established a small position on the gap up expecting a continuation and essentially the way that I'll run this is I haven't decided if I'm going to have a hard stop right here and keep it really, really speculative meaning. High probability of being stopped out or if I want to give it a little more room to run and take it down below these lows I actually have that for an action item to figure out and kind of dial it in it's one of those two but I just need to see which one fits with the broader portfolio better. And then near term target. I want to see it break above this volume node that you see here on the one year we move this into a six months kind of like this",

And then the last one.

And it's kind of still maintaining this just consolidation trend we can see this volume note continues to get built out further and further and it's just because we're running essentially sideways so this looks interesting because it's kind of like contra to what I'm seeing in chewy leading into chewy earnings so going into chewy earnings again down day across the general smaller cap mid cap universe so this doesn't surprise me but you can see leading into earnings",
