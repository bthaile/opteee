Cat's waiting outside or cat. The dog's waiting outside. It was 2 Jan 2020. Still waiting. I'm assuming this is like waiting for the squeeze. That's my best guess. But no understanding yet. It's like opera music of some sort. Getting down the tree, dogs getting old. The sleepy dog. They got tired. Dog went away. Tired dog. Okay. Weird. We'll have to spend a little time figuring out what this is. We'll help get the word out for whatever that is. Now back to the agenda for today. We will talk about this money mindset idea because it's a feeder and to everything else that we do. And before we get into the broad market, one other announcement, our leader board so far for the month. For those that don't know, we have the discord. It's completely free to join. But the discord, the lifeblood is participation. It's people sharing information, helping one another and stuff like that. So we want to reward those that are actively helping other people and actively participating. So what I'm doing is at the end of each month, the top 10, obviously I will not be a part of it. But the top 10 will be entered into random drawing. And then you'll either get like",

So you want to grab something? Sweet, I don't remember exactly what we picked. I think it was like 15, 25 bucks or something like that. The idea was to grab yourself a coffee. It's not like to just give money just for the sake of give. I always feel like that's kind of lame. It should be tied to something. So the idea was to help somebody go grab a coffee. But then I realized not everybody has a Starbucks around. So this is who we have in front so far. We have Erzule, Urzule, Urzule. We got Joe, Callahan, Ric Sky, Dad, BOD, better grab chalk. That's a fun named Dornob in Studios Old Man. These are always hilarious, all of the different handles. So that's who's up front. Time for markets. So where are we at? We're at 12.30. Let's update our thing, market overview. Let's see what the deal is. The relief rally in my opinion is now pretty confirmed. We have a very firm gap up and close above this, probably like six",

The relief rally in my opinion is now pretty confirmed. We have a very firm gap up and close above this, probably like six and a one, six or one and a half handle. And the market was pretty decisive on closing up here. So inside day once again up here, but that's a pretty decent gap up. So this downward trend is now invalid. This downward trend is broken. And we now have a new local high. This is the local high that I told you was really, really important because it needed to exceed this local high to actually signal a change in trend. So we had this close above that local high. And then we had a confirmation close above that local high today. Now, couple notes just because this happened doesn't mean it can't crash tomorrow. One of the problems people have when they apply this kind of methodology of analyzing and trying to come up with conclusions like this is we start to believe too much of our own cool aid, which means we can see things, we can identify trends, we can come up with ideas, but they're not prescriptive.

Now, on Thursday, my game plan is Tuesdays. When I drop the video, that will be GameStop specific because I want to focus on that a little bit more. And especially now with the cat coming out, I want to get back on a like, in actual regimented cadence of looking at it and reporting out to you guys. And then Thursday is going to be looking in reporting out the coverage strangle holdings. So the specific model coverage strangle portfolio is that we've been talking about in TQ's Upro, Ibit, and then GameStop if anything happens in there. So we'll spend a little more time talking about those specific positions tomorrow on that video. But right now, I actually have a couple of short calls that have phoned in the money that require management. I did some small stuff a little earlier today, but just in terms of the coverage strangle themselves.

Now, from a broad market perspective, there are a couple really key themes that I think are worth your attention. The first one is bonds are just about stabilizing. They had their gap up yesterday and then they had a pretty big down red day today. This is a decoupling from its correlation with equities. So yesterday, market was up, bonds were up, direct correlation on the day. Today, market was up again a little bit more and bonds are down today. So the correlation between equities and bonds is still a little bit all over the place. This is important from a portfolio structure standpoint. If you're using bonds as like your risk off asset, it's difficult to see how risk off they actually are at this point. So you should at least be aware of that. When we look at small caps, small caps are lagging. Small caps still are nowhere near this local high, whereas SP is closing in on the local high and Q's is not that far off, 531 versus 539. So Q's is within striking distance and small caps still a ways off. So this tells us that the market is still really expensive about rates, about inflation, and about the impact that this is going to have for smaller companies. Otherwise, we would see this same movement in small caps at",

All of this stuff is been priced in. And there's been no real new news that leads us to believe inflation is starting to pop back up or anything like that based on the breadth of what we see. But if we take a look at the Fed watch tool and let's take a look at the historical run rate here, you can see that there's still essentially 97 plus percent chance. And this is for the last week, almost, of 425 to 450 target rate for the 29 Jan meeting. So we're looking at no change. That's the overwhelming probability. That's what it continues to be. Let's take a look at compare. You can see it's not even changing much. So very, very little, very, very little change going on here.

So I posted this and I'll reiterate it. I posted this in the discord that Trump was vocalizing the potential of a 25 tariff on both Canada and Mexico. He was talking about potentially another 10 tariff on China. All of this is early as the first of February. That's an important note because again, depending on how that progresses, what direction that goes, that will be a big deal if it actually comes to fruition in that way. Specifically, the impact to Mexico and Canada. Those are ones I'm very, very, very interested in seeing how they unfold. So when I say interested in seeing how they unfold, this means that I'm watching all of the news that comes out in support of the broader topic. So that means any piece of news article, I have a specific GPT that helps me comb for any key terms related to this stuff. And it's because the market is gonna price on that. So if it looks like it's starting to become more and more realistic, I think that you'll see the market begin pricing that kind of thing in because the short-term impact will be not end of days but definitely impactful.

So we have to keep an eye on it. So the next thing Trump's from Tommy Trump, I hope Stargate opens a portal to another universe. That would be super cool. Let's take a look at the Stargate. I know that there's been a lot of news about that today. Here. So let's take a look at open AIs and then let's take a look at this and this. This is funny. So one of the things that we have to pay attention to is that the news as far as I can tell so far is doing everything they can to make this relationship damaging. I just noticed this over and over and over again. I see news articles saying like, oh, is Musk the new president? And obviously that's a play on Trump. You know, challenging his authority, making it seem like Musk is the one actually calling the shots versus Trump. And they're, I could just tell by the phrasing of these that we're trying to pit the two against one another. Now I don't know the actual relationship. I don't know either of them in person. I have no idea, but I can tell you by the framing of the articles that is part of what I can pick up from here.",

I have no idea, but I can tell you by the framing of the articles that is part of what I can pick up from here. So let's take a look from open AI and see what open AI says. It says Stargate Project is a new company which intends to invest 500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for open AI in the US. We will begin deploying 100 billion immediately. The infrastructure will secure American leadership in AI, hundreds of thousands of American jobs, generate massive economic benefits for the world. The original or I'm sorry, the initial equity funders in Stargator, Softbank, OpenAI, Oracle, MGX, Softbank, and OpenAI are lead partners for Stargate with Softbank having financial responsibilities, OpenAI, having operational responsibility. So let's take a look at this Tesla and SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk said OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank don't actually have the money to back up their pledge to invest 500 billion in AI infrastructure. Trump touted the joint venture, dubbed the Stargate Project on the first full day of a second term. Softbank has well under 10 billion secured. I have that ungood authority. Musk wrote overnight on his platform, X. They don't actually have the money. I generally respect your accomplishments and think you are the most inspiring entrepreneur of our time. Altman wrote on",

I generally respect your accomplishments and think you are the most inspiring entrepreneur of our time. Altman wrote on X. Yet Musk claimed about Softbank liquidity was wrong as you surely know. I realized what is great for the country isn't always what's optimal for your companies, but in your new role, I hope you'll mostly put America first. So a little bit of back and forth here. Now for those that don't know, there is a little bit of tension between OpenAI and Musk. Musk has a history with the company, but then he also has a lot of very different personal opinions than Altman. And the reason why I highlight that is because as you see this going back and forth, just having that context behind the relationships I think is useful because it helps us process some of the information that we're seeing. So yeah, it's kind of like whatever. The interesting component of for all of this though is there's obviously huge focus on AI. That's the top line takeaway from a trader's perspective. What matters to us? What can we actually make money off of? What can we make trade decisions on? Is funds of interest in AI?

And we know this already, but seeing more and more focus and money being talked about in that space will continue to drive some of the key AI stocks that exist. N54 says quantum computing. Quantum computing I think by all accounts is a pretty long ways off. So I think quantum computing is still a thing. I think people are interested in quantum computing. However, I do not think that quantum computing is going to be a massive focus in the near term here. And a lot of that is because it still weighs away from mainstream adoption in ways that can like really amplify productivity and drive revenues of some sort. So first question for Chattachy PT is create a list of the top 20 AI involved companies sorted by market cap. And let's see what that comes up. So I think we can clear out of this. And while Chattachy PT is hooking us up with that, let's take a look through the broad market really quick, just to understand what breadth looked like today. Let's get into overall momentum, a lot of the climbers. So a lot of what the fuck? I'm looking at the output and there's a coupling here that really confused me. So I think I need to refine",

So both 59 decline there, 70 decline there. So both are in bulk of decline on the day. Interesting subtext that you can pick up from that where that's a lot of things being sold off. I think there's been a lot of really, really significant focus on the relief rally and how strong it is. And again, based on what I see today, it looks like the relief rally looks pretty strong. It doesn't mean that it's impervious or that it's not going to weigh in at some point. But the fact that there was a subsequent gap up today is pretty telling, but it's also it is a little bit interesting because I don't think we want too much upfront pricing and gapping up like this before we have some clarity. For example, the tariffs and whatnot because if the market starts getting too far ahead of itself as we've seen it do multiple times, especially with the rate cut environment, then when we get potential pullback based on new news, it tends to be way more aggressive than what we would want",

So the reason why I mentioned that again taking it back to a trading lens or trading perspective is if we start to think that the market is starting to get ahead of itself, it's rallying too hard too fast. That starts to set us up for a bigger fall. That changes the way that we might use our portfolio and what it might go into. For me personally, that means that the way that the covered strangle overall allocation, not just the sample allocation that I show you guys, but like the total allocation, which is still the bulk of the portfolio will be managed because I don't want to get caught too heavily to the downside on a potential fall like that. If there is new news, that sends the market in the opposite direction. So that's that. Let's think peak at sectors. Energy dying. We talked about this literally yesterday.

We actually spent a decent amount of time on the stream yesterday digging into the internals of energy, figuring out what companies are actually leading to decline. What companies are still showing resiliency because there are some of them. So if somebody wants an energy play, they're there. There's stuff there that is available still. It's just not the sector itself is starting to show some weakness. That weakness seems to come from a couple different things, but a lot of it looks like profit taking. There are not insignificant volume nodes that we can see in energy that are now just getting to the point where they're showing a little bit of a profit. And a lot of people try to take the exit there when they can. Conversely, we see communication services showing a massive deviation in the other direction, meaning strength on a comparative basis. The same methodology we can apply to take a look at materials going from 93 above a five day MA to 64. And we can track the change in the five day, right? So one of the things I will look",

So this we can track the day over day change for the five day. This is looking at highs and lows for a specific sector, but we can look at this on a larger basis. And we can track how the sectors are moving on a day by day basis relative. So yeah, it looks mostly tech dominated, which makes sense. Tech has been slowing down for a while. And that didn't really feel right. So this looks closer to what I would expect to see here. Let's take a look at. Yes, and P500. Yeah. No big shock. And financials are rolling over a little bit. That's kind of interesting. Now we also have earnings. So let's take a quick peek at earnings that have come out so far. So we had a key bank, triple M, Schwab, UAL, Netflix, capital one finance, STX. And let's take a quick poke through all of these. And we just want to see how the names are behaving.

You can still see it. It's just a little smaller, but that's okay. So key. Funny enough had like a bigger gap pre-earnings. That's funny. Let's take a look at MMM. Yeah, MMM had a great earnings. So what did this come in at 168 compared to 166? So a slight beat really, really good as really good forecast I would surmise. But this also would be something to watch for post earnings announcement drift. These kinds of things tend to look really good. Sanjay says, GME is pumping now any news. The news is the cat posted on X, which crazy, but that's the news, but that is the news. The cat did post. And as you all know, when he posts, GameStop will move. We have learned that for sure. All right, let's get back and see what else. So Triple N looks good. That might be viable for a continuation move. Same thing for Schwab. That looks good. UAL. Inside move. How did they do? How did they beat? They came in at 326 versus 3 in a penny. So",

That's interesting. That's a lot of profit taking. COF. Beat upside. So one of the themes that I hope you can identify as we're doing this and we're looking at a lot of these is there's a lot of beats. 203 first dollar 67 and these are across different industries. The reason why that matters is because it gives you a general sense of where the broader market sits. Day. So let's take a look at some of them from today. My earnings play so far have been pretty good. We're not seeing like crazy moves. Johnson and Johnson. How did Johnson and Johnson do? Eaked out of profit. Who's expected at 2 and 3 and 10. They came in at 2 and 4 pennies. CMA. CMA. Don't know how that is on a relative basis. And then Haliburton rolling over. Still beat by a penny but rolling over. EBT. Very, very slight beat. EG.

What time we got? We're about 530. That's okay. And this is not what I meant to clear. That was funny. I accidentally just clicked my Reddit browser or like my Reddit tab versus O rats because they're both just orange. So my brain literally was just like, yeah, orange. Click that on. And let's sign in. We want to take a look at the remaining for this week and maybe plot out a couple trades super fast. Just to see if stuff looks good. So I'm actually going to grab my watch list for my actual like portfolio and stuff here for a second and then we'll take a look at these. So we are now looking at a Thursday PM. Right at AM. Let's see if there's anything else we need to add in. All right, we go. So Thursday PM CSX. CSX tends to be a decent one. We'll see. We have SMCI, EXN, and then Friday morning, AXP, NEE, and BZ.

James says D H I up is housing becoming a thing again. Materials is so materials has been doing pretty well. So if we take a look at D H I I mean it's D H I's not really up for. I'm really doing shit. What was it expected at? I don't know what D H I's expected earnings were, but I mean it's out like a five bucks from 140 to 145. So still I actually think D H I's an example of dying, but materials as the sector is doing. Here. So you'll probably see a little bit of sympathy move there. And then real estate started having like a really slight relief rally, but this was also really, really soft, like really, really soft. James says second biggest gainer and S and P today. That's it doesn't really mean anything, right? Like when we say second biggest gainer, but it's something that's up 2.2. Who gives a shit? Doesn't really, doesn't really move the needle much at all. And it's still down lower than where it was here. It's still like in an overall downtrend.",

Doesn't really, doesn't really move the needle much at all. And it's still down lower than where it was here. It's still like in an overall downtrend. You can't really take a single day like that and you know apply it into anything super meaningful, but it's still just super weak. It did start consolidating here for a while, but yeah, it's still just super, super weak. Now it did pop on the 14th. That's a little interesting. I don't know what happened then. What happened on the 14th? Goldman Sachs adjusted price target to what? Wait, did that say from 171 to 200 or the other way? Does that confuse me? Hold on. Yeah, it adjusts the price target from 200 to 171. And somehow it rallied on that. I am confused. I don't get that. I don't get that at all. That doesn't seem to make sense. Does it? What else? Maintains a buy? Maybe that's why? Oh, maybe this is it. So on the 13th, what time was this on the 13th? 1317. So this would make sense after the market closed.

Let's take a peek at the options really fast. Yeah, it's I mean, it's kind of split. Even split calls puts. Doesn't really look doesn't really look too great to me. Yeah, interesting. Hard to borrow. That I find also curious. And it still is sitting on a market maker move, which is also curious. Where are these options at? Let's eyeball it first. 21 feb. And 16 Jan, I think those are where we'll see the biggest ones. 9000 there. 7000 there. Yeah, so those are definitely the two biggest explorations. For sure. A lot upfront in 21 feb and a little bit of call skew there too. And then out in 16 Jan, pretty heavy call skew. This starts to look like people are expecting a little bit of a turnaround here, which is actually quite logical. If we see something that's been punished a lot and we think that it becomes overextended to the downside, we can absolutely think about when it might start to make a recovery.

That's what the the general idea behind what I'm seeing here at least. But yeah, I mean, I definitely wouldn't call this up or doing well. It had a 2 day, which is completely unremarkable across the board. There was some stuff that actually had some really strong moves today. But all that actually reminds me who was that James. Thank you for bringing my brain around to this. I needed to set up another screener. So right now, I have one that does like a gap up. And I like the gap up that's useful. But I actually want to see intraday price moves as well, which I don't have. So we'll do percent change. The latest percent change we need options. We need total OI. We want OI of at least 2000.

What made me think of this was James, when you were just talking about some of the stuff that was moving today because there were quite a few names that were showing like pretty pretty significant strength today. So I don't know if you guys saw, but ARM. Big gap up. Really, really big gap up. This is a clear breakout, a sustained breakout on volume. This is a pretty decent setup. I didn't like the movement coming into it here. So it's not like my pick of anything, but this is a pretty, pretty strong gap up. Then there's NNE, not to be confused with NEE. And NNE, I also have a position on. I was trading the breakout essentially from here.

Dark Mark says Netflix is about to raise rates. And I think you guys said, there it is, Roderick, thank you. Roderick was saying Netflix had killer subs. So I didn't look through Netflix earnings itself because I honestly don't really care, but the market liked it. And it had a really, really strong move today. This is, that's a big gap up for a company of this size. And this, I'm actually running a study right now on large cap mega cap stocks, mega cap stocks that have outsized earnings releases followed by a really strong gap up of at least 5. And what's the frequency that those follow through into post earnings announcement drift? Because for those that don't know, there's a really big series where we have long-term post earnings announcement drift that then starts to slow down and contract, especially in really big stocks. It's because it has better price information. It's more informative. So there's less price shocks. Then we start to see some of these names accelerating",

That's something that we'll go through on one of like the Tuesday or Thursday streams for the pro members to see like just what the output is because once I have it, I'm actually very, very curious. My underlying suspicion is that there will be specific conditions that we can identify specifically for really big companies, mega caps that if set criteria are met, it will have a pretty high probability of going through with drift. Now it's so important to not overfit the data in set criteria that just happens to capture the movements. So I'm that's the the biggest problem set trying to solve for is like what criteria makes sense? What criteria is overall robust, but is not overfit to the data so that we can actually have something that's tradable. So I'm starting to think, I really am starting to think that we might see a bit of a change in mega cap stocks as far as the receptiveness to post earnings and onsmanship. So this is going to be",

So I'm starting to think, I really am starting to think that we might see a bit of a change in mega cap stocks as far as the receptiveness to post earnings and onsmanship. So this is going to be a new add to that. For me to pay attention to because it's a really tradable event and the other thing just to summarize a little bit more of that thought is I'm also expanding it to the host index. So I want to see if the index shows any price shocks relative to the larger components having near term price shocks from something like earnings. So we will see this move those really interesting to me because it had obviously an incredibly strong gap up, but I mean, it got sold off into that all fucking day, which is not super bullish for like post earnings announcement drift. So we will see who really to tell. Cool. We have time for maybe a couple more. So anything else you guys want to take a look at? Dark Mark says, thought on Palantir earnings in its recent movement. Yeah, let's take a look at Palantir, the LTR. Do I still have something on in here? Let me see. I am out. I used to have a position on not long ago. I literally took it off today. Why did I take that off today? Oh, it says rotating into something",

Why did I take that off today? Oh, it says rotating into something else. I see. Yeah. So that one I actually had pretty short term options on. So yeah, for Palantir, I was in the 21 Feb 55s and I had gotten into those on the 15th year. So really kind of a bit of a sad little baby move, but the 10 points is fine with options. You can do okay with moves like that. And it's actually still moving in the correct direction. My typical move there would actually be to scale off just a little bit and leave some runners on, but it just looks like the velocity is slowing down. And there was a couple other things that I really wanted to put on. So right now my breakout allocation is essentially redlined. So I needed to take something off in order to put on more breakout stuff. The way that I manage the breakout allocations like that is I have a total allocation with respect to risk, not the dollar amounts being used. And the reason for that is once you have a bigger account, you'll find that your positions are going to get stopped out faster in terms of managing risk at half a percent or",

And the reason for that is once you have a bigger account, you'll find that your positions are going to get stopped out faster in terms of managing risk at half a percent or a percent of the total portfolio size as compared to how much money you're going to use to put those positions on. So let's say for example, you wanted to use 10 of your portfolio value on that. Well, that could put you in front of way more risk than you think you should take given a specific strategy. And for me, breakouts, they're really mixed probability traits. I'm typically lower win rate, but a much higher severity when I win. So trying to keep it structured that way is really, really important. From a long call for the last three months, looking at the last three months, the win rate is 48.9 on the breakout specifically. So that means 51 of the time I'm taking down a loss. So it's literally the majority of what happens for breakouts. And it's because the loss on breakouts is managed really aggressively. And that's designed again to take asymmetric risk. We don't want to, well, I should say I in this case, I'm talking about me very specifically here. I don't want to have positions where I have a directional thesis specifically for a breakout, which is a very specific profit mechanism.",

You don't need a lot of time to see if you're correct or incorrect on a breakout. Like it's going to tell you. So we don't want to spend a bunch of time waiting to see if it's correct. And if it starts compounding against you because it's going to be a lower probability trade, you have to be really, really thoughtful on managing the risk side of that equation because you cannot have a situation where you have a even moderately high loss rates, or in my case, for the breakouts for the last three months, in majority, clearly a majority loss rate, 51 is a majority of those trades are losses. But they have to be as long as those losses are nice and small. And the winners are multiples of those. It's a highly successful strategy. But you have to maintain that profile. If that profile changes too much, you're kind of fucked. It's not good. So yeah, balance here in the near term, I still think has a way to go.

And based on the movement that we saw today, it's placed in a pretty good volume note here over the last few days. And then the tick up and volume today. So this looks good to me. But you can see all of the different levels that I'm really interested in with respect to Palantir. I had also short puts in Palantir that I was trading separately. And that was actually getting ready to take on shares potentially, like prospecting to take on shares. That highlights a shortfall of selling puts to acquire shares. Because a lot of times you're going to get left in the dust. But I think it still has a little ways to go. I think the proving grounds right now is above 80. But I think as long as it stays above 74, it looks like it's in a healthy spot to consolidate. Even if it trends a little bit sideways here, I still like it way more to the upside than to the downside. That's for sure, especially for a longer term play.

So a lot of near term, interestingly, we have a bunch of green. What are these greens? 21 March. So it's kind of all over the place, which is good. Seeing it all over the place like that is good.

We're talking about the money mindset. And there's a specific exercise for it, but it's not about the money mindset exercise. It's literally just about money mindset. And I refer to this as actually an outlier money mindset. And it's just because a lot of people have a average disposition towards money. And again, the reason why I say outlier money mindset is it's kind of a dual purpose outlier because that's us, that's our community.

    "text": "And again, the reason why I say outlier money mindset is it's kind of a dual purpose outlier because that's us, that's our community. But then also to signify that we have to think about this stuff differently. That's the most important part. That's also why the channel is called the outlier trading channel. Because in order to do well at this stuff, you literally functionally have to do stuff differently if you want it to work. So let's talk about this. Let's talk about this money mindset idea and how to actually use it to do stuff. So I'm going to expand this over. And then I think we can, yeah, we can cut this down. So you can see the learning objectives are really high level, right? To build a healthy disposition towards money, which I regret to inform you, the overwhelming majority of us don't have that. I did not even even when I thought I did. So I want to talk about this in that context. First thing, let me grab the chat just because I need to use another window and I want to keep an eyeball on you guys. So I have a poll to get us started. And let me grab the poll. And I'm going to type in our question. How many characters do I get 100? It's open ended, but it's yes or no. So the question that I just asked is do you have a healthy relationship with money? And",

And I don't want it to be defined in this context. I want you to think about whatever that means to you and how you feel towards it. That's all that means. So when we think about having a healthy relationship with money, there's probably handful of things that will come to mind for us, but there's a couple of things that are really, really important. So it looks like we have 70, 30 split yes, no. And I am interested in both of these responses just to probe just a little bit. So for somebody, anybody, if you don't want to answer, you don't have to, but I would love to hear from somebody, from the yeses is if you were to summarize how you have a healthy relationship with money, how would you summarize it?

I don't understand blank or I think too much about this other whatever it is. So I'm interested in both. So travel ursel says for me, healthy in this context is that treat it as a tool. Interesting. I kind of like that idea. And I think we can expand on that. Okay, so it looks like a lot of you were referring to the healthy relationship in terms of budget. So blonde, swazie and matez says, I don't spend more than I earn or more than I have. So that's kind of like a budgeting take on it, which I agree with.

So the next question for you guys, I'm not going to put it as as a poll because I kind of need qualitative answers here. The first very first thing. And I'm phrasing it this way purposefully. What is money for? What the fuck is money for? And we're not going to spend a lot of time on this esoteric stuff, but I want to I want to get to the brass tax of what this is. James says the more redistributed the more that it comes back, it's weird, but it works. I think that's actually a bit of a perspective skew to be honest. I don't think that that functionally is like I would challenge that from a functional perspective. Now I want to be clear. I actually fully agree with you, but I think it's more I think that's more of a perspective than a functional component. Here's why I say that because my mom is one of those people that for a long time, she did not have much money. And she was still as giving with her money as she could be. She was too giving. She gave money that she didn't fucking have. So",

But I just think it's important to understand that we're probably talking about it from a perspective more than anything else. Let's see what we think money is for.

This way says I spend money in things that are important to me and I don't allow some amount of debt. And I don't allow some amount of debt still allow me to sleep at night.

The difference is when I got to him, I didn't really get there. I didn't come there and help him out with a bunch of his shit. Although I tried, I always try to add value specifically from a content creation standpoint because he's getting on YouTube and stuff. But that stuff aside, what I gave him was something else, a standardized bartering tool because I have accumulated money doing other things and then I can give money to him so that he can do shit that he wants to do with the money. Even if there's not a direct transfer of skills between us, if there's no liquidity otherwise, money is essentially the bartering system on Roids in so far as it provides liquidity. Because if you go to a baker and the baker doesn't need shit from you, you can't really do a bartering exchange there, but you can give them money so that they can go do whatever the fuck they need. So the premise here is money is literally in exchange. That's all it is. And the way we get money is through expertise. Effort and time. Your money represents that stuff. Now, not all people's spent time, not all people's spent effort, not all people's spent expertise is valued the same. That's",

Now, not all people's spent time, not all people's spent effort, not all people's spent expertise is valued the same. That's the reality of life. There are people that are working construction jobs that work objectively light years harder than other people in office jobs who make light years more money. The reason why this is important for you to understand and acknowledge is because as we go through the rest of this exercise, part of what we need to understand is how do we create abundance. This is the objective. This is the outlier objective with respect to money. And I have somebody scratching at the door. I think you know who. So just as we were just able to get Thor a brand new play rug, his last play rug was getting a little worn out. That takes money. However, if you don't have abundance spending money on a new play rug for your dog is completely nonsensical. And it's the absolute worst possible way to spend your money probably. But we think it's worth it because the portfolio manager here likes it. It's actually so funny that on the video, you guys can't even see like his facial features and stuff because he's too dark. This is actually hilarious. You can't see anything. They can't see you. Look",

That's his attack vibe. Look at those chompers. You see these teeth? Look at these teeth. Look at that tooth. Nice. Nice. You got chompers. Get my ugly face out of the way. Get back to this. So when it comes to money, one of the easiest things you can set your sights on right in the beginning is to create abundance. Now in order to create abundance, a lot of things have to happen. And let's talk about what those things are. What I want to grab is this, which is just like a general overview of two things worth our discussion. So we just talked about this idea of abundance. The reason why abundance is so important is because when you have abundance that comment somebody made earlier, that's really, really accurate is that money becomes an accelerator.

And for a lot of people, if you think about what are the most common sources of friction within a family, within a marriage, money is typically one of the very top ones. Let's actually see. Let's put it. I'm genuinely curious. So what are the top most common causes of fights between family? Very first one, finances. Finances, financial concerns. I think I don't think this shocks anybody. And it's because most of us, if you're anything like me, which I imagine a lot of us are, you're anything like me when you don't grow up with a bunch of money, it's a source of fucking friction because you are dealing with a exceedingly valuable but finite resource. That's difficult. So abundance overrides all of that. And I've used a few example of this before, but to move on from this point, but to leave you with something. When I used to get something, I used to work really hard. And when I would get something, I would obsessively take care of it. And that's actually, I argue, a good, a good habit, to be honest. I don't think that's a bad habit, but there was an unhealthy side to it. The unhealthy side to it was I would be so obsessive over the thing and trying to take really good care",

Like in my car, I still actually do, you can't eat in the car. There's no eating in the fucking car. You can eat when you get out. But there's other things about the car that don't bother me as much now. And it's because I can wash it myself. Or if I'm busy, I can pay somebody to wash it. Like there's little things like that. So it allows you, once you reach abundance first, to have healthier relationships with people. Because another thing that literally never happens is if I go out to eat with my friends, I will always pay. I will always pay. And I couldn't possibly care less genuinely. If anybody, I don't even ask, there is no, don't forget to vent, Mommy. Here's my cash app. Paypal me this. There's none of that. I don't fucking care. I don't care at all.

The second thing is when you have abundance, you get to express yourself in the purest form, the purest form. That is true freedom. What's not true freedom is if you have to do things a certain way in order to appease somebody else in order to still be able to make money. And it's something we all have to put up with for a while.

But it does mean that if something is going on that directly conflicts with your values, you do not have to bend to them. You can stand up and it doesn't mean you have to quit. But you can stand up and talk about it at least. You can say, I don't agree with what we're doing here or I don't agree with this for this reason. And then you can do that with an open conscious and open heart and accept the potential consequences because some places don't like that. So abundance enables this second component unequivocally, which is not freedom in terms of not being able to work. I've talked about this before, but this is probably one of the most, it's probably one of the most misconceived notions that exist. And it happens when all of us are poor. And when we're poor, we think once we have a bunch of money, we're not going to do anything. We're just going to",

    "text": "but this is probably one of the most, it's probably one of the most misconceived notions that exist. And it happens when all of us are poor. And when we're poor, we think once we have a bunch of money, we're not going to do anything. We're just going to sit on the beach all day, sip my ties and then just live life like that. And funny enough, one of the things that I found, once I started having more and more money, is I found myself able to work on things that I care about more and more. And then I started looking at how much I'm working and I literally started working way more when I had money way more. And there's a reason why it's because you don't have to trade your time for money from a pure time for money trade off. You can accept slightly less money or no money and spend your time working on things that you genuinely care about and genuinely value. That is freedom. Freedom in my opinion is not being a lazy citizen that has a bunch of money that just spends money on a bunch of material things and you're just in it for yourself. I still think we should all be contributors to society. Now, Admin note, this is Eric's opinion. This really is not anything you should take that seriously. But the freedom element is an objective truth. If you have abundance, you have true freedom.",

You have freedom to spend your time, your most valuable asset working on the things that you like. And that leads into the third thing. Money as a reminder is an amplifier. Money will not make you happy. It literally won't. I'm telling you it won't. And there's this hilarious thing, a hilarious thing that happens. You're just about all of us that end up making, again, I'm a peasant compared to some of the people that I talk to. Like somebody like Tom Sausanov, he's literally hundreds of millions of dollars. I don't know if he's a billionaire. He might be. He might be close to it. But he's done hundreds of millions of dollars from business sales themselves, not trading, not any of his actual income from a job. So the funny thing is, and I've learned this, and it didn't make sense to me for a long time. But it's actually funny because now I understand it. And when people have a lot of money, they say money doesn't matter. But guess what happens if you don't have money? That's about all you can fucking think about. So money is this really",

It's not that important anymore because you're able to do things the way you want, live your life the way you want, and do the stuff that you care about. So from an amplification standpoint, money allows you to literally amplify anything you're doing in a positive way. And it doesn't have to be done so in that if I'm going to go on a boat ride to Catalina, because it's a cool island nearby us here, that when I go for the boat ride, I'm going to have to get a mega yacht now just because I want a bigger boat for me and my wife to go. Right. It doesn't have to be that, but it can be while I'm on the boat that we charter to go because we prefer to be by ourselves because we're fucking hermits, believe it or not, that when we're on the boat, we can be really nice to the people that are helping us get there.

    "text": "So if I was trying to do YouTube as my actual income source to actually make money, like my friend Benjamin. And Benjamin does really well. 2.2 million views. But guess what? When Benjamin is making this kind of video, he has to make it from the perspective of what will do well. And he actually will talk to you a little bit about him. I'm not going to talk about a bunch of his business. But we know that if you're doing something in a way, optimizing it for what's going to do well versus what allows you to express yourself as you want, there's still a constraint there. So he does a great job and he makes incredibly good videos. But he still has to keep that in mind because that's a big part of how he makes a living. So he has to be careful about it. So this goes all the way back to it being an amplifier. It allows you to spend your time on things that you care about. It allows you to spend time on things that you value. It allows you to truly be free and do things in a way that you think are best. Okay. Next, robustness, the concept of robustness really comes back to this idea of abundance. But robustness is that we have a defined system, a defined plan that is sustainable. So first, if I think about the different ways that somebody can make money. You can",

But robustness is that we have a defined system, a defined plan that is sustainable. So first, if I think about the different ways that somebody can make money. You can make money from a W2. You can make it from contracting. You can make it from freelancing. You can make it from side hustle. These are things where you're exchanging like your primary time. Then there are passive things that you can do in conjunction or active alongside it. You can have different kinds of investing. Investing breaks down into a bunch of buckets. You can have real estate. You can have buy and hold. You can have crypto, which kind of fits into this. I don't know why that gets its own bucket, but it does for now. You can have, I've used this one before because I find it so interesting, sneakers. You can trade. So you can have other ways to build an income. It's funny because a lot of times people will say, like Eric, if you make so much money and stuff, like why do you even have a Patreon, which is literally it's a great question. The reason is because I spend so much time sharing all of this genuinely really hard earned experience and knowledge.

So not only am I spending my time, which is genuinely my most valuable resource, and sharing an experience that sharing experience that has taken me now 18 years to develop, just doing that pro bono essentially. And then you layer on top of the cost, like I refuse to pay into this thing on top of all that. Like that's just fucking dumb. And it's not robust. This is why you see people with a lot of money that still do things to make more money. It's because in order to do things, you have to have a certain amount of resources. And the robustness aspect is to make sure that you can continue doing what you love. If what you're doing is feeble, then you have a problem. So when we're talking about robustness, when it comes to the money mindset and the money mindset exercises, it's having multiple irons in the fire. You choose your own adventure.

I don't know what I'm going to do. Bad twice, one bad boss, one bad fiscal year, one bad project, one unfortunate accident, away from not fucking being there. This is not robust. This is a unbelievable single point of failure. Literally, your livelihood is attached to this one fucking single point of failure. Unwise, you don't get to control this. You cannot have a single point of failure. Okay. So now I want to start talking about the actual money mindset exercise.

What this means is we are taught from times of being little tiny kids. This is one of the hindrances that we're going to talk about. We're taught from the time that you're a little kid, but there are certain things that you're supposed to value. You're supposed to care about. And one of the signs that you made it is you have a nice car. Another sign that you made it is you have a nice watch and all this other bullshit. The reality is that starts to become society's imprint on you of what society says you should value. Now, this is not to suggest that society's inclusion here is all bad. It's not because there's a social contract. You can learn a lot from that social contract, but you cannot get to the point where whatever society is valuing starts to overwhelm what you actually value, what you personally value. So the marginal utility, the money mindset and marginal utility exercise, that's what is actually called in its entirety, is designed to help us identify what, I don't know why there's an E after what, what we truly value.

Forms of self-judgment essentially place both of these actually combined first place of glass ceiling on your performance. Now for me, a form of self-judgment is I used to say I used to say this all the time actually. I used to say people who buy designer clothes are dumb. I'd say if you spend that much money on a designer clothing brand, when you can get a cheaper version, like you're just dumb, right? You're just spending money on the same fabric on the same thing. That is a poor person's understanding of the world. That was my understanding of the world. And I used to say stuff like that because it helped me feel better about where I was at in life and where I was likely to end up in life.

It's pure fucking bullshit because here's what I've come to learn once I developed money. Here's the big secret. The person that has money gets to pick what the fuck they want to spend their money on. If they choose to spend their money on designer clothing, which I don't get, they're fucking choice because guess what? They've built the abundance to be able to willingly pay 200 for a t-shirt that they know costs 16 to make maximum, including the designer prices for the design on the shirt.

We do it in other ways where we say things like, I don't need this. I don't need blank. I don't need much. Now, there is a insanely delicate balance that has to happen between, and this is something I've reconciled with myself, and I'm not done yet, actually. This is something that's ongoing for me because I'm a big student of stoicism and stoicism preaches expectation management. Stoicism preaches that we should be content with what we have now, and that one of the largest sources of dis-ease, not disease being sick, but dis-ease being not at ease, is the gap between where we are and what we train ourselves to want. I think that makes a lot of sense, actually really enlightening. I also don't fully agree with it because I think that kind of dis-ease causes action. It causes us to do things if we're uncomfortable. I think a certain amount of dis-ease is needed to precipitate action to cause people to do things. Back to this glass ceiling thing. If you're taught to be too content with where you are with what you have, then it tends to lead to complacency, not looking for more. That doesn't mean the inverse. In my opinion, the way to balance this is we should continually remind ourselves to be exceedingly thankful for where you",

This is one of the things that I find so funny when I tell people like, oh, I have a herniated disc and it's literally been now six months that I can't bend forward at the hips. That kind of sucks. People are always just like, oh, my God, that's so bad that sucks. I appreciate the empathy. I appreciate the gesture, but I always remind them. If I could wave a wand and have a different past six months than what it's been, I don't think I would. I genuinely don't think I would. And it's because it's taught me so much. It's made me think about things in such a different way. And not to go super far down a rabbit hole, but it's helped me understand my dad and like my biological dad and all of his bad behaviors, his alcoholism, all the stuff that he did that as a young man, I didn't understand and judged him too hard for.

So back to this broader idea, though, of these glass ceilings is that most of the glass ceilings that you're going to come across are things that you put on yourself. And we should be exceedingly thankful for where we're at, for the luck, for the fortune, for the work that we've put in that landed us where we are today. But in my opinion, that does not mean that we can't be hungry to grow and try to build abundance. It just needs to be tempered. That's my opinion. So a big common hindrance, though, are these different kind of self-judgments, external judgments that manifest as glass ceiling. And then it becomes this thing where subconsciously, there's a big gap between where you are and where, quote unquote, rich is in your opinion of it. And that subconscious brain is so powerful. It's going to, it's literally going to prime all of your actions, what they are, what they do, how you behave. And if you behave in a way where it's like, yeah, you know, I don't care about being rich. That's just dumb. It's just excess. That's just selfish.

Then you're literally going to take a bunch of subconscious actions that don't lead you there because you don't value it. You don't care about it. I think that you can be an insanely impactful and helpful rich person. And everybody should be that. Everybody in our community should look to be exactly that. You should look to be an outlier rich person. People that behave differently. That's what we're here to do. So now let's talk about the last hindrance, which is this near-term expectation. This is where we weigh overly weight, the near-term outcome of spending, or the near-term outcome of how we spend our time. And this completely derails the longer-term objective of where you're ultimately trying to get. The funny thing about this is that the more you sacrifice and the earlier you do it, ultimately, the earlier you get the reward, but you have to sacrifice and embrace the laid gratification early. So to recap, what an outlier mindset is. It's a different way of thinking. It's a different way of thinking about money, and it's a different way of thinking about your relationship with money. It's the pursuit of healthy abundance. It's understanding that money provides true freedom. It does not provide happiness, but it's an amplifier for everything else that you choose to do.

It's understanding that money provides true freedom. It does not provide happiness, but it's an amplifier for everything else that you choose to do. Some of the most common hindrances to developing this are self-imposed. It's through judgment. It's through the internalization of external factors, societal pressures, family pressures. There's another thing I see all the time where people are like, well, you know, I don't want to get too much money because then everybody's going to bother me for it. The fuck does that say about the friends you have? If that's the case, that's already showing you that you have a fucking cancer around you that you need to fix without money. The fuck. So that judgment can be the internalization of external factors. It can be external factors, or it can be purely self-imposed. But we have to start stripping away those judgments and those judgment statements that we say because it primes our subconscious brain. What this means is if before, when I would say designer clothes are dumb, anybody that buys designer clothes are dumb because it's just spending more on the same thing you could get, I started thinking of it differently and started thinking they've made enough money to be able to spend the money on whatever the fuck they want.

One of my business partners who's actually the dad of one of my friends accidentally forgot that he put a weight, he put a bid on this tricked out Ford Bronco Raptor. Literally forgot about it. And then he got an email that he wanted. He's like, oh, shit, I have to arrange delivery for this car. That's like a different amount of money to like put a weight to put a bid on something that's, I mean, it's not super expensive, but it's not cheap to put a bid on something like that.

Just fucking forget about it until you get the email that you want it. That's hilarious. But that's when people say shit like that, oh, rich people don't spend on blank. It's good. It goes back to this thing, which is your homework, which is the culmination of this entire skill development section, which is understanding your personal marginal utility or things. And when I say things, I don't just mean objects. I don't mean what you can spend your money on. I mean what you value spending your time on. What you value materially. What you value in materially in terms of society or in terms of causes that you care about. So there's an exercise that I built specifically for myself originally. It's called the money mindset margin utility exercise. And what I did was give myself a few scenarios to play through. And I'm going to give you a small outline of it here for those that are in the Patreon. There's a download that's available to you. It's in the shop. Everybody that's in the Patreon gets it for free. 99. But if you're not in there, don't fret. You literally can build your own like this. The first thing I did is I created three scenarios.

So what I do here is then I paint a series of, I guess if I'm going to call these scenarios, I should call these down here like situations. I gave myself different situations. So I would have things like material situations. I would have time situations. I would have priority situations. I would have what the fuck would I call it? What the fuck would I call it? I'm priority like shit that you care about. I don't know what to call that. But it's like the stuff that you it's like if you care about causes and stuff like that, what the fuck would I call that?

People do it with people on the right. People do it with people on the left. But anyways, no need to dive into that. Everybody should have their opinion. That's the takeaway there. Everybody should have their own opinion and that's okay. So we go through all of these.

The purpose of doing it in order of one, three, two, is one helps us understand how fucking good we have it and how thankful we are to be here. Three gives us the context of if you had essentially unlimited resources. Would you do this? So say, for example, if I was a hundred billionaire, would I buy a jet apps a fucking loop? I would. I absolutely would. Why the fuck would not? That would be great. Instead of having to fly commercial to go places that I want to be able to have jets that I can fly via far direct with my wife, my dog, and go wherever we want. That is very cool.

It's annoying. It's just stuff to play Kate me and make myself feel feel better. But in this scenario of having overwhelming abundance, 100 billion of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars. Sure. Of course, I get the fucking jet. I get the yacht too. Why not? There's no reason. There's no reason not to have the yacht if I don't want. I can get the yacht. I don't have to use it myself. I'm not going to be on the yacht all the time. That's what I use to tell myself, why would I get a yacht? I don't want a yacht because I wouldn't be on it all the time. I'd spend most of its time just sitting there. That's a waste. Guess what you can do if you have a bunch of money. If you have true abundance, let your friends use it. Let other people use it. Share it with other people. So again, when we're going through this exercise, we have to be so cautious of all of these little things that we've put up in front of ourselves to make ourselves feel better for where we are and to essentially cast this idea of being rich and having true abundance is being bad because",

So as we go through the money mindset exercise, here is the ultimate output. Once you create the different material questions that you might ask yourself, and I think probably 10 to 15 per one of these is good. So a good example for time is what I have a job. For priorities, this is things like would I value health? Verse work. I guess we can just bundle values into priorities because the other thing that would be here is like what causes do I care about? That kind of thing. So as we go through all of these, we should have 10 to 15 situations for each case that we run through in the scenarios. And the ultimate output of doing this, and this is again, the exercise that you guys should do, I'll actually write it out so that you can take a screenshot. It might be a little easier. I'll close this and then I need to see if Mel put her order in. Yeah, isn't you. This is the main takeaway is for step three, which is what the fuck?

The main takeaway from this exercise is step three. And what we're trying to do here is we want to have an exceedingly clear understanding of the stuff that we genuinely value. These are things that we're not capping ourselves. So for example, I know for a fact that sub-having true abundance, hundreds of billions of dollars, I genuinely don't want the yacht, I don't want the boat. And it's because as cool as that would be to share that with other people, and to let other people use that have fun with it, I don't think in general it would provide the overall utility that I could gain from other things. That's just my opinion. So what I do is I try to figure out the things that are worth the trade off. And if I can find things that are worth the trade off, meaning if I want to spend X number of dollars on this material thing that I care about, but it's going to make me work X percent longer, maybe that's it.

But at the end of it, you should have very, very clear takeaway of the shit that you truly value trying to remove all of these different guards that get put up to reconcile where versus where we want to be. So also account for things that we might be judged by society, but putting that aside and focusing on what you care about. So like Rowan Titty is talking about building a sanctuary for groundhogs. Like how cool would that be? Titty says I just want to feed in house people. How cool is that? Right? Like both of those things are really, really cool to be able to do. And if you have true abundance, that's essentially how you get there. So that is my business pitch on the money mindset exercise. Why you should care about it? What you should do to get to the end of it. And then tomorrow, during the stream, we're going to go through an actual case study on how to work through the money mindset exercise and then to arrive specifically at what to do with it. Meaning how do we take the output from the money mindset exercise and then turn it into something that's actionable? How do we feed that information into our plan? That is the goal for tomorrow.

They're always just happy to see you. And yeah, it feels like a lot. So let's grab where did we do this? Money mindset.
