    "text": "Quick discipline hack. Throughout the day, once or twice, whenever you want something, make yourself wait. Just make yourself wait. Two minutes, three minutes, five minutes, pick a time if you want to take a sip of your favorite beverage, if you want to eat lunch, if you want to go outside. Anything that you want to do, make it a conscience, abstination, until you decide it's time to do it. It sounds weird, but we start to develop in a powerful internal mechanism that transfers over beautifully to trading in the rest of life. The Nut \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064aola.",
