    "text": "So let's up everybody, Eric here. So Tesla filed with the SEC stating that their board approved a stock split via stock dividend and they're looking to add it to their annual shareholder meeting likely to be later this year. The last two were in September in October before that they used to hold them around June, but it looks like it'll be later this year. They don't announce it as it gets closer. We don't know in terms of the ratio, what it's going to look like. Their last one was in August of 2020 and that was a five for one. Now a stock dividend is kind of what it sounds like. Normal dividends are paid via cash. So in this case instead of receiving cash, share a holders would simply receive stock. So it's just a way for them to process it. You can check out the rest of the filing in the link in the video description and a catch all later.",
