    "text": "what's up outliers quick market update got two things on the agenda for today the first one is going to be Siri and then the second one is going to be GameStop so I got an email from uh Jacob and they were essentially asking about some unusual options activity that they were hearing or coming across in Siri and then there's speculation obviously if it's roaring Kitty that's that's one of the things I've definitely started to learn about the community is that as soon as anything even potentially related to something strange kind of immediately gets questioned whether or not it's ruring Kitty and rightfully so because of the way that the dude operates it doesn't surprise me whatsoever and also because the way that the cat likes to kind of be mysterious right and that leads so much room for speculation so I know some people get a little frustrated with other people when they're like stop thinking it's wearing Kitty or whatever but I would just say one who knows and two it's kind of the way that the game goes at least as far as I could tell I still consider myself very new to the overall gme ape space I'm learning more and more every day but it doesn't surprise me especially when you realize that most of raring Kitty's communication modalities are super vague right it'll be a string of emojis from a Missy Elliot video I can't even say it seriously it's",
