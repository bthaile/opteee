Now, one of the other things that we did is spend a little bit of time piecing together when he got into these other positions, which I actually think is a really important process that we went through because it highlights a few things to me, but one of them primarily being he had like this really heavy scale day on the 22nd that then tailored off. And it seems this almost seems like happenstance that ends up going on here. This is what 35,000 contracts, like I don't know, it's just these seem, these seem weird to me. I haven't really been able to get to the bottom of that from at least a perspective standpoint. So I am very curious here. Now, where we left off, we had gone through, we understood his stock position when he added what the residual basis was that he needed to add all that stuff was in here. I also went through and I took a look at the time, the time distribution of entries, which I do think this is kind of interesting if, oh no, I don't want that. I want to insert a chart. So what I did is, I don't want a line chart, I want like a frequency. No, that's",

So what I did is, I don't want a line chart, I want like a frequency. No, that's not it either. These aren't what I want. Yeah, I'll deal with this later. What I noticed when I was looking at his entries is that there was a lot of frequent entries at the same time frames. So you can see this 12 handle, which is right before the market closed, is really dominant in his entries. And we can see a couple stuff near the morning, but not many. So if we were to eyeball this, get rid of this, super chart. So let's do like 11 o'clock in past. This is a count of eight, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, out of 24. So the majority of his entries occurred in that 11 and past handle, which is really interesting. Nick says, thanks again for doing this. Eric, this is actually an awesome series, how you're statistically analyzing the trades. It's amazing. Yeah, for sure. Happy to do it. Part of this is I am genuinely, I'm just super fucking curious.

I was actually, I was texting with Newton. What he and I were talking earlier today. He was telling me about the PSA grading thing, which is really interesting. Oh, he just texted me again. Hold on. He's telling me about his next hype date. And I'm asking if we started a tracker. I really want to see how these different hype dates work out. Specifically from Newton. Because I know like on on Reddit and stuff, I see like a lot of people just kind of take pot shots at stuff. Cedric says seventh, no. Yeah. So I see he told me it's seven, no. And he says, I'm asking them for some details around it. Like what's the general thesis behind it? And then I also am asking if we have a, if we have like a tracker, because that would be really cool to keep an eyeball on. All food says I love the clip he posted. You know what you're going to do.

So I haven't been asking him just because you know what that's like. You don't want to make somebody feel like you're you're pestering them. But the last time I invited him on, I told him it literally I do these every single Saturday and he's welcome to join me quite literally whenever he feels like it.

So yeah, that's my that's my guess is that he's just kind of like enjoy and do in his thing. I think the live streams he enjoyed, you know, when we when we spoke about it. But I didn't get the sense with the competing interests that he has now, you know, that it fits in well. But yeah, like I said, he and I we literally text almost every day. So we'll find something at some point. But it's I know what it's like to be super busy. And I wouldn't want him to feel any pressure whatsoever. Because that just kind of sucks. Because one of the worst things is like sometimes I'll have friends that invite me to do something. And it's like two or three times in a row that I can't do it.

I'm super appreciative because one of the things is I actually find I find I really like collaborating a lot with people like a ton because it's also like the same thing this do in the live streams is way more fun for me than making videos like hands down.

Well, like the first one we did was a lot of me understanding his perspective and kind of picking his brain on the broader context. So that's one of the things I wanted to do in the future is have one where it's kind of more of an open dialogue about different ideas and stuff. Just to kind of probe a little bit. I don't like when I'm first getting to know somebody, I much prefer to like shut the fuck up and listen and understand them as much as I can. But I think he'll be another kind of person that will be fun to kind of go back and forth and explore ideas. I completely agree.

If this was 50 dTE, I would have bought it. Like that would be okay. Meaning it would fall more in line with this. This we know we can see back. This was clearly in earnings play. That's what this one was. That's fucking something, man. I believe I believe it's something. This I don't know though. Roryntady says yes, but what did he know? We'll take a look.

This is so interesting to me for a lot of reasons. The first one is there's obviously something around this time frame. That led to interest. So. I have to understand more around this time frame.

But I think that this was testing an entry, meaning starting with a much smaller position and seeing how the market would react to the size and to the liquidity.

It wasn't at a larger scale of how much he was influencing the price of GameStop. I think here he comes in fully knowing how much he can influence the price of GameStop. And he knows that here. And I think what he's doing in this instance is testing the market response to this specific trade. Then I think he's testing the market response to scaling in at a much smaller size. And then I think he's testing the perceived movement of it from that point forward. Dr. Zayah says, how can a single trade influence the entire stock? It's a great question. So the way that this can influence the stock is on the 24th when he entered those were at the money. These tens were at the money. And if we look at the volume, let's take a look at a curiosity. The volume here was 4.8 million. The volume of the day before was 2.5. My guess is when this 1000 lot came through that triggered a few things to happen. The",

My guess is when this 1000 lot came through that triggered a few things to happen. The first is they likely were starting to hedge some of the calls. The second thing is I think that between the buying activity and the hedging of the calls that probably led to other market participants starting to think, oh, there's something going on here. Again, this is how I personally find trades as well. That's why I think this. So it's not that I know what's going on, why it's going on. I have no idea. But this looks like testing an exit on this and then buying in more because these were bought when they were in the money it looks like. So the really interesting part about all this is that my big assumption as it sits now before we go further into the rest of this, which will be informative for me. But my current hypothesis is at this point, he knows how impactful his trades can be. And I think he knows that his movements can move the stock. That's what I think.

So very interesting to me. Very interesting to me because there was none of this activity prior to this point in time. And then the activity started at this point in time. So that's why I believe they're linked again can't confirm it, but that's what I believe. So now let's see what happens to these let's go into May.

The he's disincentivized from going into the weeklies in general. It looks like the the weeklies themselves. They're less liquid so he would prefer those other contracts because he he was building into bigger size as longer ideas. So I generally agree with off Putin that he hasn't done non-monthlies before. I just don't think that necessarily he is relegated to them. So, off Putin says look at 12, 15 and 20 strike he typically buys out of the money not in the money. I think the problem there is you're getting too locked into a reference. And I think that you're not adapting to the data as it fits because for example, he going off of like what he did before.

That's what I think this is. Don't know what, but I think the him typically buying stuff that's out of the money is completely fair.

The Sunday 6 May was the was the Monday before. I don't know what to make of any of that if anything. So to me, this looks like he was testing an idea. Yeah. And it lines up very, very well with the timing of these trades. The thing that doesn't line up well are the entry times. He has a lot more morning stuff here, which I can't explain. That's a hole in the theory compared to these. But my guess is I don't think he's weighing the time that heavily. I think he's generally trading early morning towards the close. That definitely holds true. And then I think the rest of it is probably just when he happens to be logging on. Like I don't think he's purposely trying to get on it like a specific time.

And it's stock on 24 April. Rowan to the says why are you so surprised? I don't understand. I'm surprised for a couple of primary reasons. The biggest reason why I'm so interested now by this is I see a massive shift in approach. Massive shift in approach. This entire time frame is somebody that's trading this thing on a value perspective. Thinking that something is going to grow in value get bigger. Just overall up kind of idea. That's what these trades all mean to me. The way that we're entering longer term positions. The way that we're scaling in and out. We're holding them for typically long duration of the trade. All of those things really lead me to believe a very specific approach which is based on expected value in the future. This is a quite literal complete departure from that complete departure. And it signifies between this time frame a complete change in approach has occurred. Don't know what, but I can tell you that based on the trades I see coming",

Assuming, and this is a big assumption, assuming that this is him, which it fucking looks like it is to me. All of those conditions being the case indicate a significant change in overall approach. That's why I'm really, really surprised slash interested in this change. Roryntady says it's kind of devalue just short-term swing trading, not at all. I mean, I get your point, but it's not. And the thing is is that we know he changes from being a value investor. He talks about it. So value, like value doesn't materialize in a month. Value is the kind of thing that takes years. And again, signified by his first option is trade that we can trace back to being 495 days. Right. So like this is absolutely a value play. But then you can see as we start getting near and near in time, even to these trades in 2020, like as we look across this latest entry of trades, they come in massively in time. 168 DTE, 137 DTE.

Up here, he's doing, he did a stupid small little play with his, this was an earnings play. We already know that. But like, but when he bought in here on 14 Jan 2020, 450 DTE, 190 DTE, then as we get into July, he start coming down 137 DTE. So the time frame started contracting a little bit. I think part of that just has to do with what options were open as time was passing, right, where the next primary expiration was that's far out in time. But this is a complete departure from that. This is literally a different approach. So that part is real interesting because then for me, it begs the entire question of what is the approach. And I'm hopeful that as we go through a couple more of these, we'll be able to see a little bit more detail of like what the approach is because there's something going on here.

I don't think it's the idea of like trying to dump on retail. I don't think he'd do that. But I do think it's him understanding he can move the market and playing the movements that he can do in the market. That's what I think. Because this is out here. So I think it's going to be around 3,220,220 and then when he, these are what? 20 May to 21 June. These other ones came in. 24 April. Yeah, so those are also about a month. So I cannot help but find that also completely completely different. So one that was 52 DTE and he had one that was three and I actually think that the one that was a 52 DTE. Where is that one? This one. That looks like playing something. I don't know what. But he had one there and then again, this three, we know exactly what that is. So all of this, they're typically trades that are greater than 100 DTE. Then we get two back to back series of 30 day trades. That's real interesting.

And this, this looks like measuring the impact. What happened on 6 May? Let's do this. Let's go to May. Ricky says like to everyone that isn't a blind diamond hands holder, I thought it was obvious. He was profiting off manipulating GME in his most recent trades. I don't it's hard to say with respect to like the manipulation that starts to get into like that terminology, like the specific meanings and stuff and that part I'm not personally positive of. But I do see your point and I do broadly agree. Yeah. And then he says, is it manipulation if there are a lot of unhedge calls and he is using that? There's not going to be a lot of unhedge calls. So another thing to keep in mind is I actually, and I think I talked to you guys in the discord. This isn't loading for some reason.

He's been in the market making business and options trading business for a really, really long time. And he I we spoke briefly a couple times and I spoke with him a couple of weeks ago about a couple things that I was finding as I was doing different research on the cat. And I asked him about a meme stocks in general in how meme stocks have changed the market making space and how they react to stuff like that and whatnot. And essentially that boiled down to him saying that like in a broad perspective, market makers have gotten a lot more calculated with the risk that they'll take. That looks like thinkerswim is being updated because it's trying to log in right now and it can't. So that's that other goes.

Blancway, he says he's not manipulating on low volume under the right conditions, a reasonable size, bulls position has some decent impact. Yeah, but again, Blancway, this goes back to like what are we defining as manipulation because that that that is like if that's the thesis for the trade that's not trading something under the guys of like a change in fundamental value. Right, that's obviously trading the expected movement of something based on a broad market effect and impact. So yeah, I don't I don't know what people call or define manipulation as personally, but I think that that's part of the effect here. So it looks like it looks like this is down. So what I'm going to do is grab good old I'll actually use trade view because I'm trying to get a little bit better with using trade view.

Lonzo as he says if he was testing if they are hedge I don't think he's testing if they're hedged. I think it's really important to like decouple the different participants here. I don't think the market makers are the main people that he's trying to test here whether or not they're hedged or not. I think that he's probably seeing what broader positioning looks like. That's my guess. I don't think that he's playing a bunch of games with market makers. I think that makers have a pretty defined purpose and it's not that expansive. But other institutions that might be systemically short something like GameStop that's a completely different story. I think at least. I need to add how do I add some shit I just need to add moving averages at least. Do they have no I don't want that ribbon might be fine.

I think that those would be so fast. And he's also not going to be able to essentially create an algo that would outpace the like what a purpose of an algo is. At least in that context. So. I think. The movement that we saw in April. That looks like him. So I think that's what I'm expecting something to happen here. Or expecting the impact of his trades to be something. So. I don't know what. If how what the thought was around this 13 may 14 this time frame. Is that part's interesting. So the time for the positions is actually like not good in with respect to that it's it's quite mistimed. So the unwind started six May. Which would have been here.

I don't think that this is some sort of you know, understand the the tea leaves and projecting some sort of hyper specific date. Like that's not what this is because if that's the case, even with him building the position on 24 to 26, he wouldn't have sold anything on the sixth. And he sold a good bit of it on the sixth. He wouldn't have sold on the 15th and the 16th. If again, that is the case where he knew something was going to happen on the 14th or whatever it is. I don't I don't think that at all.

Do we know when I think we started looking do we know when he bought those shares. That would be highly informative here actually when the 5 million shares came online. I know that we have like windows and stuff, but do we know the specific dates. Let me look at the dark pool. And we're looking. Let's look in April. Okay. Let's sort this by premium. So this. We had 5 million shares here on two June. Based on what I see here to June. Let's go to March. Okay. So quiet in March. Generally quiet in April. Very busy in May. Very busy. So one of the things I was trying to test here. I was very curious if he bought shares before he bought those options. The reason why I wanted to test that is because one of the theories I've here. I've heard thrown around is that he kind of is using the share buying or the option buying to cause a wave that he's then using. For the other side of the transaction. And I don't.

I've already told you guys this is where I first caught wind of GameStop from my scanners was the beginning of man. I think it was the third or the fourth something like that. So this is when I started looking at playing GameStop myself because I could just see that it was becoming activated right it was very busy and that's different though than what it was doing for a significant periods of time prior, like massive massive periods of time prior. So I don't think I don't think that there's like specific specific dates though. I don't see that because the exit here again from like a specific date perspective is also mistimed.

I mean better timing would be essentially that X-its with respect to the movement of the underlying, right? Like better timing would have been exiting on the 14th or even exiting on the 13th, 14th, 15th, right? Because when I look at this, the first exit that happened here is 6 May and that was a 5,000 unwind. So if we take a look at 6 May, that's here. So this is a little bit of a pop for sure, right? Made a ton of money, no doubt. But not is anywhere near as much as what would have been made if we had a date, right? Like if we have some sort of date that we are super convicted in, then we would play that date. So yeah, that's why I don't think that there's like a specific date that he's playing here.

I really don't. I think he knows about them. And I think that he's, I think he probably integrates them. The problem with FTDs is that they don't work all the time. So I don't think he's basing it on FTDs for that reason. If he was using FTDs, there would have been a lot of other triggers that may or may not have worked. So yeah, I don't, I don't think the FTDs is the big thing here. Jimmy says they work all the time, half the time. Yeah. That's the problem. Again, and that's one of the things like when Newton and I, when we discuss things back and forth, I think sometimes Newton is a little bit too much in terms of confirmation bias in terms of trying to see what he wants to see.

So we can look at either volume expansion, FTDs, and we can run a regression to see how effective they predict the movement. And I've done that. And they don't, they, there's definitely a correlation to be clear with the movement. A lot of times that there's movement, these other things do move. But I don't think it's a causal relationship. I don't think that the FDD movement is now forcing the movement in GameStop. I do think there's a relationship. And I think it can exacerbate it. I think it can start it. I think that there's a lot of relationship intertwined there. But I don't think when we've looked back at these other periods where either there was massive volume expansion or massive changes in FTDs, I didn't see a clear signal from those. So yeah.

They're very meaningful. And they're important. I think they're very important. I think they're a part of this whole puzzle. The main thing I'm just highlighting is I don't think they're predictive. That's an important element. Now again, are they related to movement? Sometimes when they happen, I absolutely think so when we can see evidence of it. The problem is when I'm assigning something predictive capabilities, it needs to have some sort of consistency in its ability to predict a future movement. So I and I don't see that. That's the main problem with using like FTDs as the like a predictable pattern, so to speak. Now I do think that we very likely and I mean, this is the interesting thing going forward.

So yeah, that didn't really do anything. Again, so even Cedric, the way that you frame that, right? It jumped a little, I think that's that's confirmation bias that's looking for and perceiving what you're wanting to see because I look at the the close before it was 2083. The open the next day was 20, 2101. So if I look at the close to the high 2083 and it hit a high of 2188, it moved a dollar. Right? So that's using the prior close from 87 to in a that's giving it the benefit of using the high of the next day, which realistically, you wouldn't necessarily use the high there.

Never mind. Big dog, DAWG. I found it. Here. So this was, oh, I guess. So this is supposed to be like this here. Obvious tailwind price improvement volume often gap up or gap down. I feel like that's the problem is I just I get. I struggle with that. I actually don't agree that that's like a opx tailwind here. Let's go to because there's going to be a spike in volume. That's for sure. But that's because it's just an opx. Right. Like there's, there wasn't a gap here. It's essentially within the same candle. I mean like a small gap. I wouldn't consider that anything. But yeah, I think is like I wouldn't consider this something necessarily like a tailwind hitting volume actually contracted leading into it. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, I just don't see it there. Oh, no, that was in 888 of 22. He has an updated. Okay, I see. So he didn't count this one. Let's take a look in 22 just out of curiosity. Where the hell is 2022? Here it is. I just want to see what he's looking at. August and he said it was August 5th. Yeah, I got it. Okay. Yeah, this 100. I would consider that for sure. Not the fifth,",

Yeah, this 100. I would consider that for sure. Not the fifth, but definitely the eighth, the following Monday, the fourth to the fifth. I don't think there was much of anything, but this, this into this, there definitely was definitely an expansion and volume, note down, but not significant. 17 and a quarter to 17.8. Like that's not a big change. So Jimmy says, I got to chat you Pt to explain what a top op x tailwind is. That's kind of like a, it's it's not really anything. The idea behind a op x tailwind is that when you go into an options expiration, there's going to be an amalgamation of trading activity that's going to move the stock price up. That's why he refers to it as a tailwind, but op x is just options expiration. Now, whether or not options expiration is a tailwind or something else, you know, that's a, that's a whole other, whole other story. But this one I can totally see some elements of so that I'm following, following along with. Interesting. Okay.

That Lauren says quadwitching day did a thing that was hilarious, which is also funny, because quad, it's not even called quadwitching anymore for anybody that's curious about it. I did a video talking about it, because that's like an options derivatives focus topic. Here's a video about quadruple witching. It's essentially just triple witching now. And it's because of the way that different expiration cycles have aligned. So it's still, I mean, you could call it quad, but it's really not. The other thing is with so many additional explorations now opened up, the overall impact of triple witching quadruple witching is severely diminished. It used to be a much bigger deal when it would happen. And there was only a handful of explorations available. That's a completely different story. But that's not so much what it is anymore. All right. So let's take a look at where there are any changes in his positions here, not until here. So let's just skip to that. Actually, no, let's not get lazy. We're already here. Let's just do the thing. Yeah, it's not even that many. I'm going to be lazy, Eric. So let's do region, dixion, and June, 13 June. Regune. Just slide this off so I can easily see. Not too many left.

Oh, I did it go up that much. All right. And value is at 586459.005. Okay. Then we have, and June, TG is 31. That's fucking crazy. 31, 513. This goes back. There are no fucking dates. I don't think, man. You don't go from 382 million in gain down to 31. 29409.005. Value 235459.005. That's wild. And then let's go to 13 June. So TG now is 5136454.99. We're at 634372401. And then 268452844. Got a one. And then here, we had an exit. And then we also have ad shares. This is bought to open 4 million. Here's. Okay. So let's see what happened to these. I know I have to get off in a minute. I don't want to rush through this. So the last thing that we're going to have on the agenda for this then is to analyze. I'm taking a note here.

Vimperida says SEC and lawsuits would happen if it was an actual pump and dump, hence holding. And the meme about SEC coming. Yeah, I mean, we'll see because the in his case, I think the idea of pump and dump would be really, really blurred. Because like even the dudes at fucking whatever that penny stock trading pump and dump were the one dude pled guilty and was obviously convicted and like the other dudes fought it and they got out on some bullshit technicality even though they're fucking guilty, I think. They, I don't want to say their name. They to prove something like that is very difficult. But if you read through that case, it was pretty fucking clear that they were very purposefully trying to mislead people and manipulate people. With somebody like the cat, the only thing you could even attempt to say is that he knows if he posts a meme, which is true. I think so. If he posts a meme, GameStop is going to move. Like I think he knows that. So because he knows that, I think it opens up a different conversation then around and like ultimately what that looks like in terms of any sort of manipulation.

Well, the funny thing about that stuff too is like sometimes I noticed like when they depose rappers and stuff, they'll use the, they'll use like rapper lyrics as evidence, which is hilarious. So yeah, it's very interesting. I don't really know what to make of it. I'll make a video tomorrow about just kind of like the latest of GameStop and kind of where we're sitting now. Of note though, one of the things I wanted to do before we balanced is, do you guys have a list of any primary thesis or DD or ideas behind like what people think is going on here? Because as I'm doing this, I'm starting to create what I believe is going on. But I'm very curious if other people like what the most popular analysis is on what's going on because I want to take a look at those. I want to start pulling those up. Cellar Box Theory. Yeah, well, Cellar Boxing is a thing. It's not even really a theory. But that, I mean, that's probably what was going on",

So for any of those kinds of theories, if you guys can either email it to me or just drop it in the discord outliertrading.io. So you guys can shoot me an email with a link to whatever it is so that I can take a peek at it because I want to start looking through them. Because once we wrap up the trade here, that'll be the next step, I think, is to better understand what's going on now. What happened between 21 and 24? That kind of thing. So we will, we'll see how that goes. All right, gang, that wraps me up. Awesome catching up. Always enjoy doing these sessions with you all. If you need anything, hit me up. Always around. And then if there's anything that you want me to take a look at for the GME, we'll kind of, it'll be a market outlook video tomorrow. But I'll include a piece on GME just because I haven't covered it specifically in a little while. So we'll take a look. Being outlier, being ape, being outlier, ape,",
