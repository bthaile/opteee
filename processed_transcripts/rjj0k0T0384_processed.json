    "text": "a bit of a rally point but again we have earnings coming up so it's always a crapshoot whenever you have earnings involved now the main thing I wanted to show you is from the 1 ratio calls to puts total and I see the call side growing a little more aggressively than the put side now this still is moderate enough that like I'm not thinking anything massive is happening here it's a little too early to decide anything like that but it does tell me that there's still at least a bit of bullish activity going on in here although we're just not seeing a lot of movement at a GameStop so my game plan Remains the Same as per usual I am very eager to see earnings come out I know that we have some ideas on what it will look like but I'm eager to see the way that the options mark Market's position before earnings I'm really eager to see the way that markets move after earnings comes out I'm eager to see if there's some sort of readen to the way that we're going to use the money that GameStop has again I've been told a few times by folks to kind of not expect that so I'm relaying that forward so that my eagerness doesn't turn into other people's disappointment but it looks like based on what I've been told it's unlikely that they'll share anything like that I still hope they do",
