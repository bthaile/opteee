    "text": "The reasons to trade options, there's a lot of them. There's also a lot of drawbacks that people don't really pay enough attention to. So the goal of this video is to walk you through why I trade options and then to give you some starting points on how you can get your feet wet and get into the world of trading options. Because for the vast majority of people, you'll notice it kind of goes a little bit like this, where we start putting on trades and we don't know what to do. Or we lose all of our money trading options. That's a pretty common one as well. Or because now roaring kitty is back, everybody is yoloing into GameStop calls. And unfortunately for most people, this isn't going to work out super well. So the idea behind this video is to walk you through how I've used options. And there's plenty of people that do way better than I do. But this just kind of shows you that you can make good money trading options. From 2007 until 2023, my compound annual growth rate is actually now just up over 26. I had my best year to date last year. So punchline is you can make really good money doing this stuff. If you can resist the allure of really fast short term money, because I mean realistically, when they're down 50 hoping that somebody else is going to make the money. It doesn't work super great.",

So let's talk about the reasons to trade options. What's up to the outliers? Welcome back to another video. And let's get straight in. So the first thing to know is that when we trade options, we are actually adding a lot of complexity. What does that mean? Well, you have to look at stuff like this that might not mean anything to you. I actually think it's kind of cool. And then you have to understand how to read this kind of stuff, which again is pretty kind of cool once you know, I don't use it. But realistically, when you do something like you buy shares of Tesla, for example, really what you're looking at is something that looks like this. This is your PNL. It's a PNL graph. The Y axis shows how much money you're making and or not making. This is the zero line. And then the X axis is different prices in Tesla. So right now we're using this is where the current price is the center one. And then this is minus and plus one standard deviation than two standard deviations in them.

And it's the fact that when you are buying shares, really two things can happen. It can go up or it can go down. There's no expiration. It's pretty straightforward. As soon as you start adding options, now not only do you have to be correct in terms of your your direction, you care about something called volatility. And that's really just the perception of how something is going to move in the future. You also care about things like interest rates because that can impact the PNL of your position. And then there's also now a time frame component because if you'll notice from this back here, all options have an expiration date, which is to say after the 17th of May, the options in here, they're gone. They all expire and that's it. They're gone. So you have to go into options with your eyes wide open understanding that we're adding complexity. So why? Why would we add this complexity? Well, it's for a few really solid reasons. And they give you options, the ability to create these very specific risk reward payoff structures and they allow you to do a lot of things",

And they give you options, the ability to create these very specific risk reward payoff structures and they allow you to do a lot of things that equities outright do not. You're a sex of them. The very first one is they offer you leverage. What does that mean in this context? Let's take a look together. This is using Tesla at 175, just for an example. And let's look at two different scenarios. Let's say that you want to buy 100 shares of Tesla and let's compare that to buying five 170 calls in Tesla. You don't have to worry about what that means just yet. Just know that means you want it to go up. Okay. Well, let's take a look at the relative costs for these two different positions. In this case, you are putting up 17,500 and you are controlling 100 shares of Tesla. In this case, you're putting up 8,725, but you're controlling 500 shares of Tesla up to 500. In the beginning, it would be a little bit less than that because we're at a 62 delta. So in this case, it would just be 62 times 500. That would equal your current number of shares, notionally, but you get to control up to 500 shares right from the jump. This right here is leverage at play. The other thing",

The other thing is the risk payoff for these two different things actually looks quite different. So if we go back to this and take a look together, this is what just your long shares look like, right? As we already kind of pointed out. Now, let's take a look at what long calls in this example look like. Notice how different that is. We still have unlimited profit potential to the upside, but now you have limited downside. The most you can lose in this trade is how much money you put into it, which in this case is 8,725. That's the most you can lose. That's very different than what you see when you buy shares, well, Tesla, you have unlimited downside and unlimited upside. Why is that the case? Well, because there has to be a trade off here, right? We just acknowledge the fact that when you're trading options, you're adding complexity to the position. So in this case, you now have a time frame that you have to be correct in, which is 72 days to expiration. So that means that over time this is going to decay.

In this example where you buy 100 shares, you'd make 1,500, which is 8.6 return on invested capital. In the scenario that we bought options, you make 5,000, which is a 57 return. Uninvested capital, much more capital efficient if you're correct. So it's a way to leverage the things you're doing. And if you're good at picking direction, you can make a lot of money trading options. There's no doubt about it. Let's go into a couple of these others. Direction optionality is pretty straightforward. And all that means is when you buy stock, you need it to go up. Now, you can short stock so that you're trading something to the downside. And it kind of takes an inverse graph here. But when you do this, you're actually borrowing shares. And you have to pay interest on those shares that you're borrowing. So it's a slightly different look. But the cool part with options is you get to create all these different kind of risk payoff diagrams, where maybe we have some long premium and short premium side to our trade. So we have downside",

But then we're actually selling some calls to amplify the strategy. Or if you want to reduce your risk a little bit, you can actually sell puts against your long puts. And notice how it keeps a similar payoff diagram. But we're actually collecting a little bit of a premium upfront. And it helps our break even if we're slightly wrong. So you can create any sort of combination of strategies to capture whatever directional disposition you have, including things that are moving sideways. If you're trading equities, you need something to go up or down. It has to move somewhere other than receiving a dividend, which is helpful. But you need price movement in order for capital gains potential with options. That's not so much the case. The other thing is you get to hedge risk, which is actually part of what you were just seeing. Right? We're able to reduce our downside a little bit if we're so inclined.

    "text": "not so much the case. The other thing is you get to hedge risk, which is actually part of what you were just seeing. Right? We're able to reduce our downside a little bit if we're so inclined. The other way you can reduce your risk is let's say instead that you want to buy the same shares, but now you buy a put that put decreases your downside risk. So that you have a capped downside at this point. Again, options give you a lot of choices. They can reduce risk. They can let you create very specific structures. That makes sense for you. Let's get into two more of these specifically. The trading volatility and structural alpha. Something like trading volatility can be really useful, specifically if markets aren't moving much. So a great example of this is back in 2015. The SP 500 in that year returned 1.31. It didn't do much. However, if you're trading things like volatility around earnings releases or if you're trading zero DTE options like I do, you can make money even when the market's not doing a whole lot. The other thing is volatility is its own asset class. It behaves its own specific way and it's actually way more predictable than stock price in short term time frames. And the other thing is structural alpha. This is a way that you can capture on little quirks in the market that over time bear edge, meaning they make you money long",

This is a way that you can capture on little quirks in the market that over time bear edge, meaning they make you money long term runways. So options grant you access to all of this. So if I were to start trading options, this is the list of strategies I would start with. I would use these two different buckets, bullish meaning we want things to expand or go up bearish go down and then you can split them for bullish directional or bullish volatility because these are two different asset classes essentially that let you capture different kinds of price movements. This is where I'd start and I have videos for essentially all of these and I'll throw them in the notes below options in general have the ability to quite literally change your entire life. It allows you to much more carefully manage your risk. You can be super aggressive looking for a lot of leverage expecting a lot of volatility or you can say I don't want to be quite as aggressive. I want to decrease my volatility but still make money. You can do all of that with options. Be an outlier. See you later.",
