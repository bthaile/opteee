    "text": "the reasons to trade options there's a lot of them there's also a lot of drawbacks that people don't really pay enough attention to so the goal of this video is to walk you through why I trade options and then to give you some starting points on how you can get your feet wet and get into the world of trading options because for the vast majority of people you'll notice it kind of goes a little bit like this where we start putting on trades and we don't know what to do do or we lose all of our money trading options that's a pretty common one as well or because now roaring kitty is back everybody is yoloing into GameStop calls and unfortunately for most people this isn't going to work out super well so the idea behind this video is to walk you through how I've used options and there's plenty of people that do way better than I do but this just kind of shows you that you can make good money trading options from from 2007 until 2023 my compound annual growth rate is actually now just up over 26 I had my best year to date last year so the punchline is you can make really good money doing this stuff if you can resist the Allure of really fast short-term money because I mean realistically when they're down 50 hoping that somebody else is going to make them money it doesn't work",
