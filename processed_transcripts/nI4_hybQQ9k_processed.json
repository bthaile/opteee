    "text": "The overwhelming majority of traders fail primarily for literally one reason and it's because they don't understand the reality of the game they're getting involved in. Most people start trading myself included with the idea that this is going to be fast easy money and then some of us are able to make the transition. I just wrapped up my 18th year of trading. I've been able to figure it out thankfully but a lot of people once they get slapped in the face with the reality that this is not fast easy money. It's a business like just about any other. It has elements that are really cool elements that are really difficult but if you understand the challenge you are much more likely to be successful in doing so. So something to keep in mind with trading is you can always go into SSR and dot com it's a completely free website and just type in the word trading. The what pops up take the time to understand the landscape and save yourself some money. Be an all or see all that.",
