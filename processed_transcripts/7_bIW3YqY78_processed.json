We're on the next options trading for beginner series and as you can tell I do have my crappy camera because these typically run 60 90 minutes ish there's no time frame necessarily it's whatever it is. But I have this so that I can stand up and sit down and stuff like that. So here's the rough agenda for what we have in store for us today. It will be a pretty heavy dose of analyzing options chains and then it will be a slightly lighter dose of building trades but I want to immediately start that process with you guys because there's a really important transition that happens with trading and really markets in general where there's a lot of theoretical learning that happens and we need to immediately as soon as possible make the pivot from theory to practical application. I actually think that's one of the reasons why I've been able to kind of create the success that I have with trading is because I never got to hung up on the theoretical side it's something that I learned in parallel with everything else and I want to be super clear what I mean by all of this it doesn't mean start trading real money. I actually think it's a giant mistake for the vast majority of options traders. I think the best possible",

It's a super super unsexy answer and that's probably how you could tell it's the right one because most of the things that lead to positive outcomes tend not to be what we would rather do to get there. There's a lot of effort that goes into it and especially for kind of beginner options traders really would have boils down to is it's so easy to make a ton of dumb mistakes that we can avoid. So I actually think I have a video on kind of like a trade checklist. Let me see if I can find that real quick before I forget. Yeah, right here. So that video there is kind of like a options trading checklist. Yeah, I think that one's probably decent at least to give you guys something to start off with.

And the other kind of just general rules for the road is feel free to chat in at any point. There's some people actually that were giving me some flak for taking too many questions during the sessions, but honestly, like I don't care. It's why I'm doing it during a YouTube live session is to interact with you guys. I have a video coming out. I think sometimes next month. I forgot how long it is. It's like an hour or 90 minutes that I just shot straight all the way through on like an introduction to options trading. So for the people that really prefer a more end to end discrete process that's coming out next month, I have an old video as well that I can throw in here in the meantime. It's just a old video.

Or kind of a general trading thing, right, to we'll start right off on the practical side of things as I was alluding to before. This is a really common and effective pattern to trade where a booming stock goes through typically a really strong drawn out up move 30 to 60 price appreciation.

And you kind of just follow it while it's going through this sideways trending thing, keeping a really close eye on how consolidated it gets. If we're starting to see higher relative lows and how many times we're touching near term resistance, all that kind of stuff. And for me, this is a quintessential momentum breakout candidate. And I would bet dollars to donuts, it will break out to the upside. Nobody knows. I want to be super clear because I know there's beginners in here. You have to be really careful when people pontificate about what they think or what they know is going to happen. Nobody knows. So whenever I say probabilities and stuff like that, very probable. That's in my probabilistic assessment of things to be abundantly clear. Don't listen to anybody says about what they think is going to happen. The only opinion that matters is your own.

This is another great learning point for you all. We covered this a little bit, I think, previously. The difference between implied volatility percentile and implied volatility rank. But these are just different ways to plot the relative volatility of a product against itself, which is a really important process because you can have something like, let's look at GE. GE has 30 volatility. So not a ton, but take a look at the implied volatility percentile. It's 70. So what this means is on a relative basis, it's quite volatile relative to itself. But if we go back to SMCI, this has 82 volatility so much higher volatility yet as a lower volatility percentile. So again, that's why the conversation of relative volatility becomes super important, which again, we'll talk a little bit about before. We also have cricket core, cricket core, cool name.

There we go. Abdulaz says, hey, is high higher IV better? That's literally a fantastic question. And the answer to most of the things you're going to hear me talk about with respect to trading in general. Is it depends. It heavily depends. So most things in trading are not inherently good or bad. It depends on what side you are of the effect and what your overall disposition is. So here's the way to think about it. High implied volatility or just implied volatility in general, I would completely detach it from the ideas of good and bad. And I would qualify implied volatility by itself. And then there are different strategies that will benefit from it. There are different strategies that will hurt from it. Right. So then that good and bad becomes qualitative based on what you're doing. So what does high implied volatility tell us? Very, very simple. Volatility is a financial term of variance. What we're looking at is the dispersion from some sort of mean that's time bound. That's what creates this volatility thing that we're looking at. So when you see things that have high volatility, it means that we're expecting to see greater dispersion from a mean of some sort. So let's take a",

So when you see things that have high volatility, it means that we're expecting to see greater dispersion from a mean of some sort. So let's take a look at a example right now. If we take a look at SMCI and we look at these, these are called linear regression channels. It essentially weights the sizes of the moves. So that 50 and 100 of the moves will fall within these bands. You can kind of loosely use them as standard deviation channels. The reason why I like these is because they're not arbitrary. They're built off of existing price as it is. So if you overlay something like standard deviation channels with linear regression channels, a lot of times they'll line up very, very close. Sometimes it'll be very disparate. So I prefer linear regression channels for those reasons. Now, if we look at something like SMCI, you'll see that again, really high implied volatility, 82. So if I take a look at 275, which was the low, and then it hit high of 1229, the massive move, volatility is an indication of how much we think something is going to move.

Because one of the things I want to talk to you guys about is funny enough. I gave you guys a couple of thought exercises in here. Because I want to start highlighting a lot of the flaws with the standard person's way of thinking, compared to what it needs to be for trading. So you can forecast volatility, which is forward looking. Most retail traders are not doing this carte launch. And the reason for that is because there's a lot that goes into forecasting volatility accurately. Anybody can forecast it. You literally can look at previous price moves and come up with a guess of where you think the range might be going forward. But the entire name of the game is how accurate is it. So retail traders in general aren't super worried about forecast volatility, but you should know it exists because the people who do forecast volatility market makers, folks like that, they implant that essentially into pricing models. That's how they determine what they're going to offer options premiums at. And we on the retail side, observe it through implied volatility. This is",

This is the volatility that is implied through the options pricing. You can use something like the Black Sholes Martin model to pull out what the forecast did volatility is by whoever forecasted it to see what it is. So in this case, when we're looking at this specifically, implied volatility, that's what this is. It's looking at whatever the market consensus is for forecast volatility for this product, which is forward looking, forward looking volatility. This standard is 30 days. It changes kind of all the time. Charlie, welcome to outlier bronze. Great to have you. And so essentially what this means is going forward, how much do we think something is going to move? That's pretty much it. So going all the way back to your original question of is high volatility good or bad? Well, in general, for options traders, whether you're buying or selling, we typically prefer more volatility because that's you need things to move. Even if you're buying volatility and it's expensive, which means on a relative basis, you're overpaying for the exposure that you're getting, you still want the product to move.

So you might be overpaying in terms of vols priced into the premiums, but if you get really big moves, you can make a lot of money. Now it's not always the case though, because some of the best times to sell volatility, selling options to capture volatility is actually when volatility is low. Because a lot of people will hear kind of the tasty trade methodology of if volatility is high, you sell premium. And it's not bad. There's it's an okay way to think about it and it'll get you there most of the time. But the reason why it's not ideal is because don't worry about the white line so much here. Take a look at these two yellow lines. These are two different term volatilities. The darkest 30 days, the seven, I think right now, let me confirm for you. I think it's two days. Yes, two day vol. So in this case, you'll find that there are periods where implied volatility might be high on a relative basis. It's elevated here.

But there's a danger. If you sell volatility when volatility is high, it means whatever your trading is probably going to move a lot and that can hurt if it happens to move in a trending direction one way or the other and you're on the wrong side of it. So it's like most of this stuff a bit of a long winded and nuanced answer, but that's because I'm not trying to give you guys the easy answers. The easy answer to that would have been yes, we want volatility high because this stuff moves. That's the short succinct answer. But as you can tell from that entire thing I went through, there is a lot of subsequent detail that goes into actually arriving at what I would consider to be a legitimately accurate answer, which is what I can't just say care to share with you guys.

Yeah, I think if I were to think about trying to break down the world of options trading into the simplest simplest thing, I think that's probably right. You like where your head's out there. Okay. There was another question up here that I don't want to miss. So Cee Lee, that's a cool name, are there any signs between all the Greeks that can give insight when an option is priced in our favor? I get Delta and Theta but have trouble incorporating Vega and Gamma. That's hilarious. You know what you do know why that's so hilarious because look what I have. There's a first thing we're going to talk about. You guys are getting a little too good at essentially creating the segues for us. But that's actually exactly what I want to talk about.

And what I would love to do is actually spend a little bit of time talking about how to think about them. And the reason why I want to spend the time thinking about them is so that you understand how to wait the decisions you're making because here's the deal. Whenever you're looking to buy a stock, for example, let's say SMCI because we have SMCI up. And you say I want to buy this stock, I think it's going up. It's a really simple analysis. You go through your technical, fundamental analysis, and then you say I'm going to buy the stock. That's it. You have one thing to buy. And it's done. Options add a lot of complexity. There's a trade off of the complexity. You can make money from different market forces. You can make money even if things go slightly against you. You gain access to leverage. You can trade on margin or with margin, not on margin. So there's a lot of benefits with options, but they do add complexity. So if we take a look now, at this idea of buying SMCI, and we pop over here, and now we're looking at the world",

Well, first we have to figure out what expiration cycle we're going to pick. You don't have to pick that with stock with stock. You just come up here and you say, okay, the offer right now is 898 75. I'm chill with that and you buy it and then you're done and you move on. There's literally, we have to do a bunch more steps with options. And that's actually the goal of walking through these is I want to walk you through a really loose framework on how you can think about all of these and make an efficient decision. And really all we need to do for that is understand the trade offs that come with each of these. This is the beautiful part and the difficult part with options. It's difficult because there's more things we have to think about. But the beautiful part is rather than trading a stock that when I put that trade on, it's going to go up or go down and I have a one for one move with the underlying itself.

So let's start with this idea of days to expiration and also Carlos, my man, big to everybody knows they're supposed to hit the like button. That's what actually helps us emerge from the depths of the YouTube algorithm, which is one of my goals to try and bring this information to more people. So thank you Carlos. All right. So days to expiration. What's the trade off here? Let's take a look. If we think about and actually one, sorry, one more quick admin note on this, I just recently made a video on buying call options smarter, which I'm going to drop that in here for you guys. It's just a reference and that walks through really more from the call buying perspective a little bit about this. And it's probably a good reference for you guys on the idea of how to think about some of these criteria. We're going to go a little bit more in detail here though. All right. So days to expiration.

And if you know some of the ways that time impacts these contracts, throw it in the chat as I go through it. Kind of a way to assess your own understanding. Then I'll take a look at what you guys think. So the very first thing near term, expiration, they expire faster. Yep. No shit Sherlock needs to be said. The further out and time you go, the longer your positions have to work. That could be a good thing or that could be a bad thing. If you're trying to play a short term move, going super far out in time, it not makes sense. So again, it has to be in the context of whatever you're attempting to structure is your position. But there are components to DTE that remain the same no matter what you're trying to do. Like that one right there. If you go further out in time, the position will have longer to work. So then you have to determine what's the amount of right amount of time for your position. The next thing, the further out in time you go, the more extrinsic value in option is",

The next thing, the further out in time you go, the more extrinsic value in option is going to have. Why is that? Well, because if you'll recall, in options premium has two components. It has intrinsic if it's in the money and it has extrinsic, which is all time value. We know that all options expire. So sooner or later, all of the extrinsic value is going to go away. All of it. So if you go further out in time, these options will have way more extrinsic value because the contract spans a longer duration. As we get closer and closer to expiration, extrinsic value declines and it starts to decline precipitously within 60 DTE. And again, for a quick refresh on this, you guys can take a look at that. So as you can see, theta decay, this is for at the money options. If we take a look once we start crossing within 60 days expiration, the amount of extrinsic value starts declining massively. That's theta decay. That is all of the extrinsic value starting to bleed out of the options super fast because going back to what we were just talking about, all options expire.

And if it's coming up on expiration, whether it's in the money or out of the money, it doesn't matter. All of the extrinsic value has to go away because there's no more time left in the contract. So the other component to think about here is how expensive the option is. So you can probably reason your way through this component. If you have a contract that spans a longer time frame, those options probably will be worth a little bit more on a relative basis. And we can prove this out. I'm going to move this away from SMCI into spy just because I want to use something that's a little bit cheaper so that it's easier to see because with SMCI is you were noticing in the option chain, the numbers were really compressed because it's a big product. There's a lot of numbers. So if we look at spy and let's look at a 30 delta and be clear, these will still, after today, these will have no extrinsic value at all. It's just because we're coming up on expiration. But the 31 delta has 10 cents. It's bid at 10 offered at 11. So 10 and a half technically, you can't trade at that though.

Now they have 144. A dollar 44, remember, options work in 100 lot contracts or 100 share contracts. Redact that last thing. That's super wrong. A lot, one lot represents 100 shares. Super, super clear there. Try not to steer anybody in the wrong direction. But notice how much more these are worth at the same delta because there's way more time. And just to drive the point home further, let's go out 364 days. Let's find us again, that 30 delta ish. These have 13.15, 16 cents, something like that. So way more extrinsic value because these have way more time. That's your first trade off. That's the very first thing you need to look at as an options trader. Is what days to expiration makes sense. And I just gave you a list of the primary trade offs.

This is exactly what this is all about. The Greeks, they sound way, well, one fun fact, they're not even all Greek letters. We just call them Greeks, which I find entertaining. Second thing is it sounds complex and it's a little bit different, but it's like anything else. Once you understand the general rules, it's really, really not that bad. And for those wondering, we got two beverages tonight. The first one we're rocking with is spin drift raspberry lime. This one's pretty good. I like the orange one way better. And then we have a good old croaker watermelon, celtzer water, ready to rock and roll in reserve. So we are we're here. We're here with everything we could possibly need, essentially to last in eternity, talking about some options.

Because so far, like that's literally perfect. We got to take the socks off because it's getting warm in the office. That's what that little maneuver was. But that's literally perfect. Jay, that's exactly correct. Jay says you started a few weeks ago. That's awesome. Like that's I'm really, really happy with that answer.

And it's because I genuinely believe that's where a lot of money is to be made in markets is in the details. So I like that answer. Jayden says I feel like as a new trader options, those shorter term expectations seem so much more lucrative considering the cost. It's a great, great, great, great, great, great question.

And let's say that we go to like a 20 delta something like this. And let's say that you buy these 84 delta options. You're only paying 84 bucks, which is you're paying 84 to control 21 shares of spy. Which is at 544. And I'm not good at math for Marines. So again, you're paying 84 to control 24 shares of something that's at 544, 51, 13,068 bucks. That's your noctional exposure in this position. So you're controlling 13,000. You literally put up 80. So yeah, that's massive leverage. And if you get a big move in your favor in these compound a lot, you're also absolutely correct. You can make quite a lot of money here. There are a couple big problems though, which we'll talk about. I guess we can skip to it because it's on here. It's just a little further down.

You can make a bunch of money pretty quick. Who doesn't want to make a bunch of money pretty quick? I know I do. And here is the trick. I want you to look at this column here. This column is called theta. And this is the amount of time value, extrinsic value, that's going to bleed out of these options after the passage of one day. Now a common question people ask is, is this like a discrete figure? Meaning does this work all at once? Or is this something that, you know, it's kind of a continual movement? And it is continual, which is really, really important to note. The reason why it's so important to know is because with something like this that is continual, there's not a massive opportunity to put on a trade and capture, you know, days worth of theta decay. It doesn't quite work as discreetly as that. So the way to think about theta decay is it's perpetual. This is just showing you how much it will lose over the course of that time frame",

Now, seven days to expiration, we already know now that options have to make a big choice as they get closer to expiration and get ready to expire. They're either going to be in the money or out of the money. We'll talk about delta in a second. But what does that mean in terms of the remaining theta decay? It's got to go away. So if I look at something like this here, 21 delta, and the reason I use delta is it's just a way to kind of pick a common language to look at these different products. So looking at this 21 delta, that you paid 84 cents for. On a daily basis, it's going to lose 18. So again, a little bit of math for a variance here. Let's take a look at 18 divided by 84, which is the total cost of the position. So on a, as one day passes, this seven DTE option is going to bleed 21.4 of its options premium gone. It's going to bleed off. So 20, 24 of the premium you paid is going to be gone. Ceteris parabits, meaning everything else remaining the same",

So 20, 24 of the premium you paid is going to be gone. Ceteris parabits, meaning everything else remaining the same after one day passes. So that's the tricky part about how lucrative they may or may not be because while they're cheap, they decay super, super fast. So let's go further out in time. Let's take a look at these 90 DTEs. And we used a 21 delta before, right? So let's use, we'll even use a slightly higher delta, which will have a higher theta decay technically. And we take a look at the theta decay here. It's seven cents. And that's like, well, okay, that's actually kind of not that far off from what we saw in here at 70 DTE 70 DTE at 21. It was 18 cents here. It's again less than half, but it's still not cheap 7 every single day. But look at how much time value is left in these options. Let's call it 3.86. So if you take the 7 that you're going to bleed off every day, you divide that by 386 ish, that comes out to 1.8 of the options premium is going to bleed off in these 21 DTE calls as well 23.

And again, this would be even higher technically because it's slightly closer to the money. The 21 DTEs if they were offered would be probably six cents as my guess. So even lower still. But the main point I'm highlighting is even something with a higher delta will decay less quickly. Really, really important to understand these kinds of concepts when it comes to options. Because now we have a second input into our decision model. First input is how long do we want to give the option to work and how much do we want to pay for it? The further out and time ago, the more expensive it is. Now we have a second input. The further out and time we go, we know that theta decay as a percentage of the premium is less. The other thing to keep in mind, however, is when we're looking at something like this, you have way more total principle at risk. Because again, coming all the way back into these 70 DTEs, you're buying these options for 84 cents. That's the amount of money you're putting out. That's your total risk if you buy these calls. If we go all the way out here to 91 DTE, and again, we get close to that 20 delta,",

Again, that doesn't mean that you're going to lose it all. And that's one of the things that I think people run into a giant mistake when it comes to trading options is they essentially establish these positions. And then they just expect to just let them go and come all the way to expiration, which I actually think is a massive mistake. I'm going to open my door real quick. One of the funny things about dogs is that they're exceedingly patient. So my dog was just sitting there doing like one little paw scratch on the door, just one at a time like that. So another thing we have to know about theta is it is highest for at the money options. Again, we talked about this, I think in part two. So I'm not going to go through this in as much detail as I did in the other video because we already kind of talked about some of this stuff.

And as you go further out of the money, there's less extrinsic value at entry. The reason why at entry is so important is because let's say for example, you buy these really deep in the money calls and let's say you pay 7,350 bucks for them, something like that. You might be like, okay, well, there's only 1.84, 184 of that 7,300 bucks, that can decay away. So I don't care so much about the decay. I'm okay with that. That's not that much to control that large of a position for that long. The downside here is if for whatever reason, these options start to fall out of the money. Now you can go from your 184 of extrinsic value to 1,700 of extrinsic value. That not only includes the overall premium of your options decreasing, but that also includes then the entire remaining premium potentially decaying away. I have to again find the right balance here.

You can trade in and out depending on what the underlying does, which I think is again really important for people to know as you look at these things. All right. We talked about DTE. We talked about theta. I'll take a pause there for questions, and I'm jumping in the chat to see what we're looking at. Pollo says, can and should you use the Greeks to decide when to exit a position? It should absolutely be part of it. The Greeks help us understand how our remaining position is going to behave. That's not inherently the deciding factor in my opinion. The price action and what you expect to happen in the underlying is way more important. So, for example, if I'm looking at something like spy and I put on a bullish position, the primary reason why I may get or get out of the trade or add more or do whatever is depending on what the price does compared to my assessment. If I put on a bullish position, I think it's going to go up and it goes down, then it doesn't really matter what the Greeks are. My thesis is wrong. What I thought was going to happen",

That right there is probably the most important thing to start with. To help with that, let me grab another video for you guys that I did recently that talks about this exact thing. I'm going to drop this in the chat for you all. That video is essentially about how to create a consistently profitable option strategy. The entire premise of that entire video is making sure that you have good alignment. We're going to talk about that actually a little bit later in this video as well in terms of building a strategy and managing a strategy around and underlying. But it's a great question. Ryan says, does theta decay only happen each day or also intraday? It happens 24-7. Theta decay is perpetual. The options markets don't always show the movement itself, but it's perpetual. The other thing people don't understand is the way that market makers will structure their trades, it's very, very thoughtful. One of the things that they're looking for is, say, for example, we're coming up on a weekend. Things can move over a weekend. Let's say that theta decay does decay over a weekend, for sure.

Things can move over a weekend. Let's say that theta decay does decay over a weekend, for sure. But if things weren't accounted for by market makers, think of a great trade. Markets don't move that much over weekends in general. There's a lot of studies on that. I've shared some of those with the Patreon folks. If you look at the close on Friday, you get near the close on Friday, you could say, oh, well, I'm just going to sell premium. Then I'll buy it back on Monday right at the open, and I'll collect the theta decay over the weekend. Market makers are smart. They accelerate the weekly theta decay right into the weekend to account for the lower volatility period. So baked into the pricing models, not that anybody asks about that, but I just think it's important for you guys to be aware of it. Paul Andrew says, question for you, I have 20 of the 16 Jan 26. I don't know which, I assume you mean GameStop. I assume this is GameStop. If for whatever reason there is a squeeze and the stock is worth 50, what will be my market value? That's a great question.

So first, Paul, the first question I have for you is, what did you buy those options for? How much did you pay? And we can do a few different things to figure out at least what the intrinsic value would be. That's easy. We can answer that right out of the gate. If the stock goes up to 50 and you got in at 20, you would have 30 of intrinsic value right out of the gate. So that means that whatever your current premium is that you paid, you can add 30 to that. That's how much it would be worth at a minimum. That's not accounting for the resulting time value that's left in those options. But that's also why it's kind of important to understand what the original payment was because that will inform a couple other things, meaning how much time value is in those options and how much we think might be left.

You left me high and dry here and I'm just making a bunch of guesses because you haven't let me know if it's GameStop or what your premium was. It's actually getting a little lonely up here. But I might keep going anyways and we'll see how right I am making a bunch of guesses like a fool. So going out to the 26, okay, so that lines up. It does have that expiration. So I believe that my thesis might be correct. The 20s are in the money, which is a great purchase. If you bought them in the money, I love that. Also assuming that this is what you actually bought again, I'm just making guesses because you've now ghosted me entirely. Now if we look at the intrinsic versus extrinsic value, these are about four dollars in the money. So four dollars of this premium is intrinsic value. That doesn't decay. The rest of that is extrinsic value. So it's about eight bucks ish of extrinsic value.

And that will give you a pretty close estimate of how much intrinsic or extrinsic value is left in the options. But you can also just do the math, right? So for an in the money option, we need to remove the intrinsic value, which is simply how far in the money it is. Again, the stock is just called 24. The strike is 20. So that's four dollars. You would take four dollars out of this. And then that will give you the remaining extrinsic value for the option. There's oh, damn, this is not carl damn Carlos.

So when he's saying total cost, the reason why I caught that is because it's completely different if he's giving me the premium of the option that he paid or the total cost. Because when you look at the total cost, that means the premium he paid was not a hundred. It was a dollar three. So that means that this is like really low. That actually confuses me. I would have guessed it would have been like 10 bucks. All right.

So what I'm doing right now, so you guys can follow along is I'm just going way back in time to see if these were trading for a because if his total cost was 103, that means that he bought them for a dollar three. And I don't think that these traded for a dollar three. At least not going back six months. Maybe you got them like a really long time ago. Still, I don't think they were trading for a dollar three. They're pegged at nine, nine, eight years, something. And this is going back to the offering. Yeah, so I can tell you that he didn't get them for a dollar three. Sorry. Don't mean to put you on blast, Paul, but I also do mean to put you on blast because you straight up ghosted me. So now my feelings were hurt. I have a chance to vindicate myself. And yeah, here we are because I these did not trade for that. I would bet my left nut. That's my guess. My left nut that these did not trade for a dollar.

I'm seeing the cheapest it got was like 7.91. Something something like that. So what I'll do to get an even better look at this is this will come in here, look at a bigger chart, quick chart, take a little pixie. So what I can do now is I can see when these were offered. So if I go back to the max, they were offered for the first time on 9 allow shit. Oh shit. These are some Taliban options. Hot damn. So the furthest back these go is 9 11. Damn. That's kind of funny timing, huh? And I can look at where the low was the cheapest these ever traded was 2 and a quarter. So these weren't these were in bought for a dollar three.

Here I am hanging out with you guys on a Friday evening, talking to you about some shit that I've known about for a decade and a half. And I'm getting some bum scoop. I can't even get straight information. This is unbelievable. I would make an assessment that these might have been bought for 10 and three something like that. And it might have been a thousand and three dollars. Simplest explanation here might be we forgot a zero something like that. So if we take a look at this, let's say you got them for 10 and three cents. Now before we take a look at the correct answer, again, we can make some assumptions. The first assumption is there's about 8 of extra in the value. So we would add eight. The other thing we can tell us how far in the money it would be if it goes up to 50, right, which would be then 30 in the money. So that's 30 of intrinsic value about 8 of extra in the value. So with no changes in volatility that takes us about 38 something like that. So let's let's take a look. We can go into the profile here and say at",

That's essentially you could tell what they would be trading at. This is the easiest to use the platform, but you have to account for some of the changes involved and stuff like that.

I don't know what you're looking at, but there's a difference between what the market was offered at and where any transactions occurred. So I'm looking at the entire options chain from its origin from the I guess the terrorists that made this. And I can like you can you can see the same thing I'm looking at the low is 2.25. That means that this option, this is the lowest that this option transacted at was 2.25 right there. So I don't know where we're getting the 1.15, but that's not what I'm seeing. That is that's my follow up response. All right. Let's see what you guys got. But Lenders says what would be good IV when you buy an option one year out? What percentages are normal versus abnormal IV like GME? Yeah, that's a that's a really, really great question. So the way to think about it is when IV is high, you're paying more for the exposure. That's really the simplest way to consider it. Carlos says I would bet money didn't catch the absolute bottom. Again, like he didn't these didn't trade there.

Well, we could do the Cliff Notes version of this then for Paul because now now we're in it. Now we're in it for the long haul. Now we got to go all the way out here and we got to find the 20s. Ah, this is what Paul did. He bought the super cheap far out of the money options. Everything I said in the beginning about picking a good picking a good expiration. All that's gone. It's all gone. There's not there's not a good pick at all whatsoever, which we'll actually talk about. Let's use this as an example. So the 20s. If AMC goes to 50, the first thing we know again is you can add 30. That would be the intrinsic value. And then it would be about 60, 70 cents maybe something like that. So like 30, 70 ish. So let's take a quick look and see how close that is. And let's say that we get this up to 50, which I could tell somebody has big dreams. So it's like 35. Yeah. So and it would be 2,900 at expiration. So yeah, we're right on the money there.",

Now the reason why I hate that trade and the reason why it's not really worth much at all. Again, this is why when we're trading options, it's so important to balance two different things. There's the gross dollar amount of things and then there's a percent return. Because in that example, let's say that those options would be trading again, what did I say? Like 30, they'd be trading at like 35 something like that. So and he might have got them. He said he got them for like 103. So he got them for a dollar and three cents. So that would be literally a 3,298 percent return. Crazy return, right? But that's turning 100 into four grand ish. Three grand actually. I grossly over swagged there. So it's not a lot of money, right? That's it's a fantastic return on the outlay, but in a gross dollar amount, it's just not that much money. And why is that?

Especially if he got in this scenario that we're looking at, if you got like a 45 price accommodation, why is he only making that much? Well, it's because of the next thing that we'll talk about on this list. I guess the two things actually. So we hit theta. This is great. We're hitting all these. Delta and gamma are the next ones on this list. And those are the two reasons why he's not making a lot of money. Because the delta for these further out of the money options is 32. So that means that for every 1 move he gets an AMC, he's going to see his premium appreciate by 32 cents, Ceterus Parabus. Now the other problem with this is these have crazy low gamma. So that means if we get that dollar move, this 32 delta will grow into a 38 delta adding this sixth sense here. And that would be the new delta for the position for when he gets another dollar move and then so on and so forth. This is the problem with options that are further out in time at a low delta is the gamma is very low. They don't change that much. And it sucks because you lose that compounding effect.

Whereas if instead we're at something like a 50 60 and you take a look at again, something that's like a 30 delta something around where he's at. Notice how fast these would start to grow even at 50 60 T. If he's at that 35 delta ish 30 delta ish, he gets a dollar move. He's going to see 11 cents essentially double what he's seeing in the other scenario. So then that 31 will become a 42 which would look like this. Then if he gets another dollar in that case, he gets another 15 cents on top of that. So now he's of 56 delta something like that or whatever it was, 57 delta and then so on and so forth. So then if he gets a third dollar move, he's going to gain another 18 delta. So when you go super far out in time and far out of the money, you have a low delta. So you get a low dollar for dollar move and you have a low gamma.

So but that's exactly what that means in the scenario is going super far out in time gives a trade time to work. But in that scenario, if I had that position, my position would be something in the money. And the reason for that is you still don't have that many delta's, but I will get a much better dollar for dollar move. Right. So in this case, if I had this 77 delta, the four and a half here or whatever and I get a dollar move in the underlying, I see 77 cents of that dollar. So it would be a hundred dollars price appreciation. This is 77. Whereas it's literally double and then some. Now this is the trade off. These are more expensive.

Let's go all the way out to that 50 delta to prove this point or the 50 dollar lying at 50. So these four and a half's at 50, as we already talked about, they make four grand something like, oh, I'm sorry, wrong one. The 20s, my bad, my bad. So the 50s, these make 3500 bucks at that 50. And if we take a look at the higher delta that are in the, oh, wait, hold on, I'm all sorts of twisted my bad, my bad, my bad. I completely twisted it. So in this scenario, and I think it's because, yeah, these are flipped. Okay. Redo, skip the last lip over to here. We start from scratch. If he gets his move up to 50s, the in the money options would return 43 hundred or yeah, 4400 bucks, something like that. The out of the money that he would get, they would return 3500 bucks.

The out of the money that he would get, they would return 3500 bucks. So you can see, you make more money with the in the money options. Why is that? It's super simple. It's because they have a higher delta. So for each dollar for dollar move that AMC is moving, this is seeing way more of an appreciation per dollar move than these do all the way out here. But they're more expensive. So that's the nature of delta is the higher your delta, the more expensive the options are, but the better dollar for dollar move you're going to get with the underlying. You'll make more money as a gross dollar amount if you get your move. But they won't provide the same compounded return that a far out of the money option. So Ryan says, once your delta increase as you get in the money, absolutely, up until it hits a one. Once you get to a one delta, that's it. You're at the top. So in that example, essentially, what's happening is he's gaining delta until you get again, like a 10 move or something like that, then these become a one delta. So then you're just moving dollar for dollar with the underlying. So they would cap out at one. All right. Now getting back up to the top here, Carlos",

So they would cap out at one. All right. Now getting back up to the top here, Carlos says, do you think 115 for GME 628 was a good buy? Again, I wouldn't worry so much about the premium and those kinds of trades because if the thesis of those trades is a big move, the cost that you get in at is less important than potentially what you can make. So for example, what I personally would care way, way more about in this scenario is what strike, what delta, not so much the cost. The cost is part of the equation obviously, but that's not really the most important point. And it's another thing with trading is that you're not really trying to bargain by. It's not a great way to make money in trading. Um, strike is 628. That's super confusing, Mr. Carlos, because that would be an expiration cycle. 628 or you're, I'm confused now. What is this? Let's just strike. 628, I'm assuming, yeah, the expiration cycle is 28 June. So then we need a strike, which is this little guy in the middle. The strike price is what the options contract pertains to. Let's see, let's see if we can figure out what this strike price is. Yeah, so you see R4",

The 25 strike here is not terrible. Again, it wouldn't be my pick. I would want to be at the money or in the money. But the big problem you're going to have with this is, again, unless you get a big accommodating move, you're going to bleed out like a stuck pig into expiration. So what this looks like for you is again, let's say that we got in at like 125, you're losing 13 cents a day in extrinsic value. So literally 10 of the options value is gone after the passage of one day and then so on and so forth. So that's the problem. And again, that video that I shared earlier, you really should watch that one specifically for you, Carlos, because the idea is to structure trades that avoid this exact problem. Because think of it this way. Even if you get a dollar move in your favor, you're still going to be out of the money. You'll be right at the money, but you're still going to be out of",

If you get a big move, these can compound really well if you can get a big move. But even if you get that dollar move, 2 move, you're still going to be losing a ton of theta K. So that's the problem with these super short term. They're going to bleed so, so fast. So yeah, there wouldn't be my go too. All right. Back up, getting caught up on the chats. Oh, damn, Steve, you did me dirty. I was about to talk about yours, but then you moved it. You confused me. All right. Let me see. Nicholas says, how do I beat the Algos trading ATM calls and puts spy? You're playing a different game than the Algos. The Algos don't even care about you. The Algos are looking for mispricing on a volatility surface and repricing them. You're not going to beat them first of all.

So in my opinion, I would like straight up just drop that thought process whatsoever. There's no, yeah, there's nothing really for you to do there. Benjamin says, would you show how to set a stop loss and take profit on thinker swim? Yeah, you sure. It depends on, are you talking about like an option? On an option, it will, it would have to be on an existing position. So I don't have an existing position on here. But essentially, you would just do the reverse order for whatever you have on, and then you can set a stop limit. So thinker swim has a really cool education thing in here. You can go into the learning center and you can pop through essentially how to kind of complete those different kinds of orders. So this will walk you through exactly how to do it. But essentially, if you want to do some sort of take profit, you would do an OCO order, order cancels others. So like this here, you would trigger OCO and that essentially would say, okay, I want to take profit at this point or if I lose",

So it starts with an OCO and then you set up whatever order type you want based on what you're trying to do. That's like the overview cliff notes version. Paul says, how about using diagonals to bet on big moves? Yeah, you definitely can use diagonals. That's as you know, a go-to strategy of mine is ratio call diagonals for stuff like that and you can make a ton of money with them. I have a video out. I think I did. Let me see. Yeah, so this one here. I don't think this was like a big... I don't think this was a big return, anything special to be honest, but I think it is a simpler... Yeah, it's like a simple display of the ratio diagonals. Essentially what they're talking about and like my preferred strategy for directional stuff is ratio diagonals.

You can sell options against it that are closer in time, but they don't necessarily... They're like designed to amplify the returns. So again, what's most important there is actually this part right here defining the profit mechanism and then structuring a trade that makes sense for it. So what that means in this context is let's say you find something that you think is going to go up. The most important part of this equation is doing the due diligence and being good enough at determining direction to then trade something that is going to move a lot. From there, it's a matter of optimizing the strategy that you're using to extract as much profit from the scenario if that's the total objective. Sometimes it's to extract as much profit while reducing risk. Again, that's the cool part with options is you can overlay a lot of different things that you are trying to... that you're trying to emphasize. So yeah.

John Cox, why is everyone buying way out of the money calls on short dates and not in the money a few weeks out or a month off? Cheaper. That's the thing. It comes down to it is way cheaper and if you get a big move, you can get a really big percent return. Which again, that's a big percent return in options. In my opinion, it's literally useless. It's focusing on the wrong thing. That's an ego-satiating metric. To be able to put on an option is trying to be like, oh my god, I made a thousand percent on this call compounding. Sure. If you're one penny option, compounds a thousand percent, literally nobody cares. You've made a hundred bucks, right? Well, whatever it is, a thousand bucks. It's just such an insignificant amount of money that it doesn't actually matter. It just sounds really, really cool to be like, oh, I had this percent return. So it's important to keep things in context, right? Percent returns still matter, but gross returns also matter quite a lot. So yeah, that's the main reason why people go super short in time. Is it cheap? And it offers a really big compounding opportunity. But it's primarily the cheapness. Let's see.

There might be a level three. I guess level three, if there's level three, that means uncover. Level two might be like, verticals and shit. If there's three levels, I'm just guessing. If there's three levels, no spreads for level two. Yeah, okay, there we go. Yeah. So then inherently, you would be limited in some sort of strategies if you don't have full options approval. I guess this is the easiest way to think about it. Lenders says there was this dude who made 90,000 with 3000 on his year DTE cheap calls on an eight dollar move. Yeah, yeah, you can definitely do that. What I try to remind people specifically is that even short term gains, they're short term, right?

Now when you try to think about the prospect of trading long term is short term gains don't really fucking matter. Even that 90,000 dollars, what you get like three years of super cheap living if you're exceedingly frugal. It doesn't matter, right? What I try to remind people is that the hallmark of a trader is somebody who stands the test of time. It's not even like a year thing, a five year thing, a 10 year thing.

So he made hundreds of millions of dollars. I literally think he, and this is back in like the 40s. Right. So the current dollar equivalent of this is crazy. And the dude, he made tons of money trading, tons of money trading. But then like this right here, he made a million dollars in a single day, right? Massive amount of money. Paul says Jesse's mental health was always wildly sure. But that's not that's not so much the point, right?

Whether or not he killed himself, I actually don't care at all about right? That's kind of a decoupled from the scenario. The point is is that he was literally phenomenal at making money. But take a look at he went bankrupt after essentially covering his losses. 1915 filed bankruptcy again. In this case, he made 10 million dollars in this scenario. The what I'm trying to highlight is that this is a dude in 1929. He made a hundred million dollars. The problem is he ended up losing his money, right? That's the problem. So somebody that I will never even get like I can't even stand in the man shadow. But he couldn't keep his money. So when I hear people talk about like short term streaky wins and stuff like that, again, I'm very, very happy for them. Anytime you can get a break, it's awesome. But this is a long, long road.

First of all, in trading, anytime you hear a hack, here's a hack is probably bullshit. There are very few hacks, but the counteract that exact thing, this one is actually a hack that can completely change your trading with this one simple tip, right? There's your clickbait video title. What it is though, is defining before you place every single trade from now on going forward forever, your profit and loss targets, where you will exit the trade, either in profit or at loss, where that occurs. If you define that now before every single trade going forward forever, your trading will be far better. Literally, there's no debate about it. So that is every single trade has a stop loss of some sort, whether it's resting or",

Paul said, oh, whoa, I didn't realize that there's five levels. That's crazy. Where are there five levels? I didn't realize that there's five levels to options, because when I first started with like think or swim or whatever, I thought I was like two or three. That's crazy. Jay says, do you account for a missed opportunity cost when analyzing your trades and returns now? Absolutely not. It's definitely part of my assessment, meaning if I'm comparing the efficacy of two different strategies, say for example, we want to trade TSM. And you want to trade it to the upside. And I selected a defined profit strategy. So let's say that I chose to use some sort of breakout strategy where at or above this level, let me grab a price level here, where at or above this level, I was going to buy and let's say that I bought here. I absolutely need to have a thought process on if I'm selling puts or buying calls, for example, if I'm going to the upside, right? If there's something I'm really bullish or bearish,",

If there's something I'm really bullish or bearish, I'm trading something with a heavy direction, I'm not going to sell premium. Because in this case, you can sell that put, you could collect your 200. But who cares? It moved from 147.73 to 185. Your 2 don't matter at all. If you compare that to buying a call, for example, that might be 90 days out slightly in the money, you would make a ton of money in this scenario. So in this case, again, it's really a function of what is the hypothesis. That's why this, if you take your time really thinking through defining the profit mechanism, it can take you so far because it will naturally limit what things make sense. So for example, if I'm trading something like GameStop and I'm trading it to the upside, what's the primary profit mechanism? Hopefully, a really big parabolic move to the upside. Would I rather sell a put because IV is really high or buy a call? I probably would buy the call, might even do both of them, sell the put to subsidize the cost of buying the call, something like that synthetic long stock.

So that's that one. Moody Blues says, how long did it take you to grow your account to be able to make five figures selling contracts? Five figures. Let's see. The way I'm going to answer this is just by looking at my annual returns and looking at where the account essentially was exceeding five figures in terms of gain. Like, so it looks like one, two, three, four, four or five years. Yeah, four or five years. Why is Alasas? Can you imagine if Roryn Kitty began his Yolo trading from a Roth IRA with 53, he would still have over 20 years before he could touch his gains with Uncle Sam Slappin and says, sort of, it's a funny thing, but there's actually a lot of ways to crack into an IRA. That's penalty free. That starts getting obviously into kind of a really nuanced conversation about structure and all that kind of stuff. But you just know it's a thing.

A frame is role option better or you will lose money when doing great question. Every time you roll an option, you are realizing the profit and loss from a trade. Whether it's a profitable role or rolling a position when it's moving against you, which is most commonly when we use this is up for debate. Here you go. I have a bunch of videos out on it. Here's another one. Those are two videos on rolling. The first one is an old one, but it talks about why a lot of people get it wrong because they're not actually tracking accounting well at all. And then the second video is just a little bit more about rolling options and how to think about it. But the simplest way to think about it is you're closing a position and opening anyone. Let's literally let's use an example. So I'll go back into on demand and we'll take a look at what TSM and we'll go back to let's go back to the 13th of May. So boom, we're going back in time, come with me on a journey. We will be 13th of May right here. Let's take a",

It is popped up on a bunch of my scans. I'm waiting just to say another reason I'm kind of sitting here quietly is this pre-buffering needs to go away before really we can do anything. So let's say we structure a bullish trade and again to be very clear this is hindsight being 2020 right we know it's going to go up. So it's it's really easy to structure stuff that looks great when you know it's going to happen. But let's just follow the standard protocols here. I would be looking at something again that's greater than 60 typically 90 plus maybe 180 expiration liquidity is another thing that I try to keep track of. But I would probably go at least to the at least to the 74 delta trying to get closer to this 81 delta. And there's decent open interest but there's not a lot of volume.

And let's say we want to sell some options against this I'll come up here to the 52 and a halves are fine. I like the normal strikes better not like the halves because they tend to have a little bit more liquidity. So I'll probably come here to the 26s.

So what's happening in this trade right now? Well, the first thing is I'm essentially using these long calls. This is called a ratio called diagonal by the way. I'll give you a video on ratio diagonals which is kind of like a go to go to structure for me. Actually I have a whole playlist on them. Let me find that super fast. This is the way that I think about building option strategies is there's only a few things that I do. But I've taken the time to get really, really in depth and calculated with how I do just a few things. It allows me honestly to make way more money than trying to do a bunch of random bullshit. It's very difficult to do. So as you can see the trade is making a bunch of money. Right. So we put on the position for 20 grand. We're making 10 grand right now including the loss that we have on the short calls right. We collected a credit on these but it moved against us",

It moved against the short calls but it actually moved in the favor of the long calls which is the base of the position and I can actually switch us back to this camera now. Cool. And so this is where we might choose to roll. What's going to happen in this position? I would have sold these to open for a dollar and 57 cents. When I'm rolling this trade I'm buying them back for 5.43 and I'm realizing the PNL for that trade. I sold them for a dollar and 57. I'm buying them back at 543. I'm closing this trade. That's the first part of the role. So whenever you roll a trade you literally are realizing the PNL on your position. That's the first thing you have to know is you are realizing the PNL on the position. So that's the first step here.

That's an easy place to start. So in this case if these are trading for 5.45 I would round it up to make sure that I'm not putting myself in a bad spot on the role and then I would go out maybe a couple weeks. I want to go out as little in time as possible. I need to get 5.45 so I can move from the 155 I can go out two weeks and I can actually improve my basis from 155 up to 157 and then Tommy says can you move yourself yeah for sure let me change to this. Boom. Bleed out of the way. So now what I can do is see about if I want to roll out in time and give the trade more time to work if I want to roll out in up the vast majority of the time if I'm rolling an option it's to adjust my basis and that's because in this case if I'm long calls in TSM it means I want it to go up.

So all that is to say when I'm looking at the adjustment I'm heavily personally going to favor going as little out in time as I can and being able to adjust up. So if I go out one week from the seven days to the 14 days if I go out one week then you can see that I can roll to the 155 but I'm unable to roll up to the 157 and a halves and still get a credit. Now again the story goes really deep I don't want to confuse people too early but there's always nuances to this you can roll for a slight debit if you want but again keeping it a little more simple if I go out two weeks I know I can get to the 57 and a halves give myself two and a half dollars of upside change which is really important because that gives me greater capital gains profit potential and I would collect a small credit.

Cryptator says dinner's on me thanks again thank you brother I really appreciate that thank you so much for that and if there's anything I could do to help you out feel free to shoot me an email because I generally generally appreciate that now looking at this scenario here if we end up falling too far in the money you will have less extrinsic value that you're buying back but there's way more intrinsic value the options get more expensive it becomes way more difficult to roll out and up so it's a qualitative assessment how much extrinsic value are you willing to buy back to avoid that happening and it's all going to be based completely upon your analysis that's literally what it boils down to.

Oh ugly yeah so now these are this is actually a great example though of options that are super super far in the money so these are out in 28 June they're in here and we have these these are great example so these do not have a lot of extrinsic value right it's like 30 cents something like that there's not a ton of extrinsic value but these are now super expensive so they're trading for 1970 so now if I try to go out two weeks and see where I can get 1970 it's here and notice what just happened it's at the same strike they're now so far in the money that I cannot roll out the same time and still be able to improve my basis like I was able to do the last two times so now we have to go further out let's say another week and see where we can get that 1970 can we get it here and get up five bucks no just shy so now we have to",

    "text": "the beginner section of the discord and I did it mostly just to highlight what this is looking like but my trading plan now is like over 400 pages long it's something that I've built out over the last 16 years and the reason why I bring that up is having a document for stuff I think is unequivocally it's just non-negotiable in my opinion so Elon Song says I appreciate you sharing your organization and trading plans on logs yet and again for the folks that I'm Patreon there's stuff in the shop that give you like simple templates to start with I'm very against handing people like a developed trade log or a developed trading plan it defeats the entire purpose which is building it yourself so I won't do it but I will give people starting points and if you're not in the patreon that's totally cool I have videos on both of them so literally you could just follow along put the video open up a document and then go back and forth as we go through that's also available to you guys so I try to make as much of this stuff easily accessible to as many people as I can for the people that are in the patreon I always like to say thank you and maybe make it a little easier but the stuff in general is there uh Paula says I would like to learn about defending positions yeah we can do",
