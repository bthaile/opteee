    "text": "Hey everyone, Eric here. Somebody submitted a really good question. So figured we'd do a quick video on it. I realize that this is a little bit missized. Let's change that while we're on here. Perfect. So here's a deal. The question is on the screen here. I'll summarize it as always to make it a little easier to follow along. Essentially this person, whose name is also Eric, spelled with a K, which is exactly why I made sure to get to this question because they have a super dope name. But essentially they're saying that they came across a zero days to expiration SPX strategy. And this is a really common trade that's popping up more. And if you remember, this is actually one that I also personally tested. And there is a lot of hype around them because they're so appealing. It's just like anything else with money when you see things that seem really cool or advantageous or anything like that, it tends to draw a lot of attention. It's no different here. If I could tell you that you can make 1,000 in one day or 30 days, which one sounds better to you, one day. So that's really what this is playing on is people's lack of patience, essentially, where we think that if we can continue to make whatever amount of profit daily that we're going to be better off than if we establish a longer term trade. And to give a bottom",

So that's really what this is playing on is people's lack of patience, essentially, where we think that if we can continue to make whatever amount of profit daily that we're going to be better off than if we establish a longer term trade. And to give a bottom line upfront bluff response to it, it's not as good as it sounds. And like I said, I tried it. This is a strategy that I wanted to work. And I found a hybrid of this strategy to be far more effective. Whereas instead of doing zero days to expiration, I will do something closer to seven or nine days with slightly different mechanics. And that performed significantly better for me than this zero days to expiration trade. So let's walk through the general setup just for those who aren't familiar with the trade. Generally speaking, people will trade the larger indices, SPX, NDX, things like that simply because they're larger. So you don't need to put on as many trades or as many contracts to still earn a decent amount of money. And the reason why that's so important is because most folks will trade this at a very low delta. As you can see, what they have highlighted here, something close to a five or 10 delta. So if we take a look at that, it technically would be a little bit lower than what you're seeing here, because this is for a one day. It should be",

So if we take a look at that, it technically would be a little bit lower than what you're seeing here, because this is for a one day. It should be a zero day. But nonetheless, if we look at a five delta, you're looking at something close to 90 cents on the index. And don't forget, it's a spread. So typically we're going to go out pretty far to buy something further out. And then you're really walking away with 0.55 if you get hit at the mid. So that's why most folks will trade an index of some sort so that they can still collect some money without having to trade as many contracts. So the other thing that draws people to this trade, obviously the short duration is their limited risk. A lot of folks think and perceive limited risk because it is a spread, which is factual. Anything that's spread off like this will have limited risk. The reason why I say perceived is because there are some issues with that limited risk. And really, we'll get into that a little bit later, but what it's going to come down to is most will have that spread set up and most will not be willing to risk the entire spread.

But then most folks will also set a stop on top of that so that they can have something returning a little closer to their profile. And what I mean by that is if we take a look again at this, let's go a little further out to at least make some money. Let's take a look at selling this 3460 and then we'll buy something that's, you know, a lot of folks will do something like 50 fly. So something like this 3410. So in this trade, we'll make 1.55. And if we pull this over to an analyze, let me give it a my other trade. So for this trade and I have portfolio margins, so my margin requirements can be lower than folks who don't. The requirement for one of these trades for me is 4,800. So our max profit is 155. And then as we start decreasing our max loss skyrocket, it's very quickly.

So if we zoom this out just a little bit more so that we can get some more numbers down here, what you see on the screen right here are our plus one and minus one standard deviation moves. So one of the things that people really like about this trade is that it starts seemingly very deep in the profit zone, whereas you would need a fairly meaningful move for it to fall out of profit. The problem with this is once you start adding the stop, you actually don't get this entire buffer. You know where the break even is on the spread. You're gonna get stopped out somewhere closer to where you're at maybe around here. And we'll explore that. Now the other thing I wanna highlight is the overall expectancy for the trade. You all can calculate it on your own. I've shared the formula, but if you take a look, this is 155 max profit. Max loss on this trade is 4,845. So we are risking a whole lot to make very little. And again, most folks don't just trade a one lot on these. They'll try to size it up at least five, 10 lot, something like that so that you can make some sort of actual money that would make 775.

So that's why I say the spread is really an illusion in that most people are using it simply for buying power reduction because a lot of these accounts can't support taking the naked risk because if you were to just sell the puts, you would need 212,000 in margin. So first off, just like any other conversation I've had, if you can trade this strategy or a similar style strategy and not use the spread, you're gonna be far better off. You're gonna be safer not having to give any of that money back and just using the stop. So that's kind of the first no on that limited risk. For most people, it's simply a buying power reduction tool as compared to truly minimizing your risk. The other thing to remember is when we use a spread, our expectancy in and of itself changes quite a bit, especially when you choose to manage the spread.

And I was just kind of discussing that in some capacity when we look at the spread. But the most important point that I wanted to drive home on that component is the fact that if you set a stop, you're gonna find yourself in kind of much higher probability of being hit. So let's explore the overall probabilities on this trade. So first, let's say where is the earliest max loss realized? Let's call it 34-07. We'll call it 34-07, you're pretty much at max loss. So if we go to the probability analysis and we go to a one day trade, so that would be tomorrow, the probability of it going to 34-07 is something close to the fucking probability is off the goddamn. It's off the chart, that's kind of annoying. So the probability of it going to 34-07 is something close to 10-11, something like that. So it's 11 probability that you're gonna realize that max loss on the trade, which is still pretty high. Now, what again, what most people do is they'll set a stop two times your credit received, two and a half times your credit received, three times your credit received, something like that.

Now, what again, what most people do is they'll set a stop two times your credit received, two and a half times your credit received, three times your credit received, something like that. Statistically, what I found for my seven days to expiration trade two and a half was the magic number for me. So if we received a dollar 55, that's gonna put a somewhere close to 5.43 for the spread. So that means that we would put a stop when this spread is trading somewhere close to 5.43. So we can take a look at that and notice this purple line, this is telling us today what this thing would be trading for. So again, if we're looking at a dollar 55 and we're gonna allow that to expand to around 5.43, there are a few ways we can estimate that. First one is you can use this, which is a very reasonable tool. You can just see where that loss would occur. Again, to make this a little easier, you can zoom it down to a one-law. So you can see where you would be at 543 on your max loss, which would occur somewhere around 34.76, call it 34.78, because there's a higher probability as well that if the underlying is moving down like that, buying power expansion is going to occur. So let's call it 34.78. We go to our probability analysis. Let's take a look at the probability",

So let's call it 34.78. We go to our probability analysis. Let's take a look at the probability of seeing 34.78 and you are much closer to 40. It's looking like it'll be 38 or so. The reason why I have it off the date is because when I put it on the date itself, if fucking is off the chart, like I can't actually see the percentage, which is super annoying, but it is what it is. But you get the point. So it's about a 40 chance, just shy of a 40 chance of getting stopped out at your stop if you're using two and a half times credit received. So what that means is 60 of the time, you'll make something close to your max profit of 155. And then so more close to 40 of the time, you are going to lose that 500 in 43 on that zero-day-stakes variation trade. You can work that out yourself, but again, you see the issue with the trade. Okay, so we already talked about the allure in some capacity, it's quick money. So it's just, anytime you see that, you need to approach with the skeptical mind. So we've been walking through the constraints as I was walking through the general setup and kind of correlating",

So we've been walking through the constraints as I was walking through the general setup and kind of correlating it to the trade off. In general, this trade does not work very well when the market is too sided. If we have a floating bull market like we did, this strategy works very well. I used it myself for some time during the bull market, but my biggest recommendation, this isn't like a set it and forget it, this is your one-trec pony, you can do this one trade and be successful into perpetuity, this isn't that. It is very much conditional. So setting up different environments where you will employ this trade becomes increasingly important, particularly the shorter the timeframe. That's why I like the seven to nine data exploration because that allows me a little bit more of a buffer for some movement in the underlying itself so I don't exit the trade too frequently. Because most of these trades will work out, but it's also gonna test your pain tolerance. If you see something that your max profit is 775 and you're looking at a 15,000 loss temporarily, that's not easy. Not to mention again, that most would be stopped out before that point. So in general, this is an interesting strategy. It is definitely conditional,",

Not to mention again, that most would be stopped out before that point. So in general, this is an interesting strategy. It is definitely conditional, it's useful in kind of perpetual bull markets, but again, the biggest drawdown in that is there's no volatility. So you really can't make a lot of money on the trade, you have to size up even more on top of a really wide spread or if you're trading naked and then you have to deal with the fallout from that. In general, I think that it is a, again, a fun one to paper trade. If you set good criteria around it, it is absolutely one that I would revisit in the future if my certain circumstances are met. But the seven day, seven to nine day version that I employ is a lot more utilitarian and it has a far better expectancy than what you see here. So the punchline is anybody that is selling this trade as the end all be all one trick pony or this is a super successful strategy, it's just statistically not there. So if that is the case for them, there's likely other things they're doing on top of it, whatever that looks like, I don't wanna dive too far into other folks strategies simply because I don't know them well enough",

But I am sharing my personal experience testing this because I was interested in it myself. I tend to accept higher probability, higher risk trades because it's a higher probability. That doesn't scare me off per se. But there is a balance. And in general, this trade does not hit that balance. So I really like this conversation. This is a fun one to check out.
