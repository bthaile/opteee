    "text": "we're back again with a new update and naturally re-shooting this video because raring Kitty literally just released his updated position answering a lot of questions so couple quick admin notes first off shout out to the Apes again I'm having a blast learning about what's going on here with you guys and it looks like unfortunately the option side of the equation might have just been removed which we'll get into his portfolio in just a second but funny enough today was supposed to be the GameStop shareholders meeting in and because so many of you were feverishly trying to join they literally couldn't support it so they had to postpone it which was interesting all right let's get into now the new position so this is essentially what I was talking about in the video I'm re-shooting right now what could have all happened here and all of this summarizes to my hypothesis at the time was that he was pairing this down and moving into equity and the reason why I thought that is because when I look at the options chains which can tell us a lot I know raring Kitty is aggressive but I also don't think that he's quite to the point where he's just lighting money on fire I think he's trying to be purposeful about what he's doing to increase his impact and if we take a look at the positions here I noticed way more volume today again in his 20",
