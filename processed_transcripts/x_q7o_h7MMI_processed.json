    "text": "Let's talk about the VIX. The VIX tracks the volatility for the SP 500 index the SPX. So essentially what it does is take SPX options and it creates a expected volatility for the coming 30 days. So it's a forward-looking product. Now there's a couple really important notes about products like the VIX. There is no stock associated with VIX. So you can't buy it and you can't sell it. You can however trade options on it if you're interested. So trading the range of the VIX can be really beneficial. However, volatility products are parabolic in nature when they move the move. So you've got to make sure that you approach those kind of trades very carefully and always manage your risk. Talk to you later.",
