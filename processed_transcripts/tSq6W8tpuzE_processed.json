    "text": "What's up outliers? Today we're going to talk about how to read an options chain. Believe it or not, there is a ton of really useful information baked into an options chain that most traders kind of gloss over because they don't know what to look for. So we're going to do a quick recap of what the chain is, how to read it from a basic perspective. And then I'm going to give you a look inside a more advanced way to pull information to make better informed trades. So what is an options chain? And that's this thing right here. It's essentially where all of the listed options for a security exist. And it shows you all of your different choices with respect to options. Now we're going to be looking at a live options chain. Well, the on the platform itself versus this screenshot. I just wanted to give you something. If you want to grab a screenshot or something as we go through this so that you kind of have an idea of like the key metrics that we're going to work through. So let's get into the weeds. So first I have Palantir up here just as an example. And the first thing I want you to notice are all of these different aspirations. These are also known as series as terms, but every option's chain is going to have different expiration cycles. And you'll notice that there are some that are broken out into",

These are also known as series as terms, but every option's chain is going to have different expiration cycles. And you'll notice that there are some that are broken out into these yellow text labeled weekly. And then the rest are kind of like this gray text. These are normal explorations, the gray text. And they represent the third Friday of the month, standard options expiration. And then there's weeklies. And if you look at something like SPX, there's even daily options. The main note is that in general, most of the liquidity is going to be in the standard options expiration. And that's simply because that's where larger institutions and entities gather together because they know that the other one's going to be there. It's kind of like going to play basketball and knowing which court to go to because that's where the people are out of the version of that. Then you'll notice that for every single one of these explorations, there's a different implied volatility. Every expiration has its own implied volatility. Now if we click open one of these expiration cycles, you'll notice that there's kind of two broad sections. There's the call side over here labeled by this. And then there's the put side over here labeled by this. Then you will notice that there are a bunch of columns. I actually have a lot, which",

We're going to go through them. But one thing to note is that the same columns that are on the call side, they're mirrored over here on the put side. So you'll notice, for example, the bid in the ask and then you'll notice the bid in the ask. So the point of that is you will essentially review this together on one side, but it applies to the other side. So another thing that might jump out at you is the different coloration. There's kind of like this gray color and then there is this not gray color. This color represents in the money options. That's why they're caddy corner to one another like this. So quick refresh for calls. If your strike is below the current stock price, which is 84 92 in pounds here, then it means you're in the money. Then everything that's above that is out of the money and then vice versa for puts. So now let's talk about these individual columns. The first thing you'll see here is bid as spread.

And if I want to sell an option, you go towards the bid. Now one of the cool things is you'll notice that there's a gap in between these and we can try to transact towards the middle of this gap. So if we click into this and hit buy, you'll notice how there's this little bar down here that shows the mid price and then the natural, which is whatever you would get hit at the bid or the offer respectively. So you can actually try to play it from the mid. So let's say if I wanted to buy this option, well, if I wanted to buy it right now, I would have to do it at 385 is that's where there's currently a offer resting from somebody willing to sell it at that point.

Then you'll notice this next is Delta, which measures the rate of change of premium per one point move in the underlying. That means if Palantir goes up by 1, the premium of your option, Seteris, Parabis, everything else remaining the same would move up 41 cents. Then you have your gamma, which is your rate of change of Delta per one point move in the underlying. So that means that if Palantir did go up by a dollar, you would make your 41 cents from your Delta, but then your Delta would also grow by three pennies from 41 to 43. Next up, you have Theta. You'll notice that Theta is negative. This is the rate of change of premium per one day passing. And as we know, options decay. So that means from today to tomorrow, this option here will lose 13 cents. Next up, we have Vega. This represents the premium rate of change per one percent change in implied volatility. So if the implied volatility in Palantir goes up by 1, this option here would go up by 8 cents. So there's a lot we can use the Greeks for. And specifically, it's to help us fine tune our positions.

Volume, which is this one represents the number of this specific option that traded today. So for this 90 call, there is 56, 77 contracts traded today. We don't know if those are opening contracts for closing contracts. We just know that they traded today. Then over here, this 88, 82, that represents open interest. These are contracts that are currently open. This metric can go up or down. New contracts can be open so it can go up from 88, 82 or it can go down because people can close contracts. This updates overnight and it's not updated throughout the day. So this means this 88, 82 will stay like that all day. And then at the end of the day, the volume that occurred today will be integrated into the open interest, whether that volume is opening trades, then this number would go up open interest. If some of these are closing trades, then some of this would go down",

    "text": "all day. And then at the end of the day, the volume that occurred today will be integrated into the open interest, whether that volume is opening trades, then this number would go up open interest. If some of these are closing trades, then some of this would go down by those closing trades. So this column right here with the colored numbers actually represents the day over day change of open interest. These are custom coded by me. You can use Chat you PT to help you with it if you're interested, but it just helps me visualize the changes of open interest. And you'll see why that matters to me later. So what this means is from yesterday into today, 415 contracts were added were open for the 90s. And you can see 2524 were added for the 92s. And you can see three were closed net net over the entire transactions for the day. So we can observe the changes in open interest, which is really useful. Next up, we have the implied volatility. So just as the stock itself has implied volatility, just as the term itself, the expiration as volatility, every single option also has implied volatility. Then we have probabilities. So one of the really cool things about options is they inherently provide us probabilities. A lot of people will use delta as an approximation for a probability, which is generally okay.

A lot of people will use delta as an approximation for a probability, which is generally okay. I have an entire video dissecting acts. It's not fully accurate. You can actually see it's not accurate right here, because this column here shows us the probability of being in the money at expiration. And then this column here shows us the probability of a touch sometime before expiration. And you can see that the probability of being in the money at expiration is 34.54. But this shows you 41. So you see that's actually pretty big gap. So delta is somewhat useful for that, but it's not perfect. Now the last two columns I'm going to show you are currently the size. This is an assessment of liquidity. Notice how there's only two at the bid at 350. And then there's 183 at the offer at 385. What does this tell us? Well, it tells us that there is a really small offering to essentially take these at the 350. There's only two contracts that are offered at that price. So for some reason, people really aren't wanting to trade at the bid. So they are sizing it down a lot. But you can see for the ask side of the equation, it's kind of different. There's 183 offered at this 385. So we're more open to trade at this.",

So then what this tells us from an inherent perspective is if I wanted to put on a five lot and let's say that I wanted to sell a five lot at the bid for 350. Well, it means I would only get two of them off unless more step in to allow me to complete that transaction. So you can use the size, which is the number resting at the bid in the offer respectively, to get a sense of the liquidity that's being offered at those levels. And then the last one here is theoretical price. The theoretical price essentially is the platform's method to calculate what the option should be trading at using all of the standard inputs into an options pricing model. So stock price dividends, implied volatility, so on and so forth. So ideally, this gives you at least a like a sense of what the fair price of so this is how you read an options chain.

So the first thing I want to talk to you about is volume over open interest. And then I want to talk to you about implied volatility. So if we take a look at the broad options chain itself, we can see a bunch of different metrics with respect to volume, open interest, and so on and so forth. So here's the total volume for today. And we can see that there's 746,000 calls traded against 535,000 puts. So way more calls than puts now somebody might immediately assume that that means that that's bullish. Lots of people are buying those calls, but we don't know inherently. But what we can do is we can see what percentages of those traded at the bid at the offer or between the market. So if it traded at the bid or the offer, we make an assumption. Now, people regularly wrongfully assume that this means with certainty that something is bought or sold because remember the bid is essentially where you need to go to sell things and then the offer is where you go to buy things.",

Sometimes it's way more dominant than others, but it's a starting point. Then we can take a look at open interest data. We can see, well, how many total calls are there relative to puts now for index options? You'll typically see more puts than calls. In single security options, it typically reflects the general bias that people have. And the reason is for hedging activities versus directional speculation.

It can come into trying to assume where we think the market might be expecting things to go. But what we can also do is track the relationship between volume and open interest, like this strike here.

So whether or not they were bought to open or sold to open, that's we don't know yet. We'd have to look at the data below. But we do know that 513 of these traded today only 188 of them exist. So when we see volume exceeding open interest, it tells us that there's a build out occurring at that level. That's actually what this column tells me. Notice how where you see 1.1 that tells us that if that's over one, there's now more volume than there is open interest. So it allows us to hypothesize and to look at activity for people that might be building out directional positions that might know something. Now let's talk about volatility really quick. We can see that there's term volatility across all of the different exploration cycles. And really what we look for is just big deviations like this here. So you can see it goes from 79, 74 down to 69 then kind of starts rallying up. So that leads us to believe that the market is pricing slightly higher volatility in this section compared to this for one reason or another. We don't know.

    "text": "goes from 79, 74 down to 69 then kind of starts rallying up. So that leads us to believe that the market is pricing slightly higher volatility in this section compared to this for one reason or another. We don't know. But we can start doing some homework and we can come up with ideas as to why that might be the case. There could be a contract renewal. There could be earnings coming up. But it tells us it's a question mark we should look for. The other thing we can do is actually look at the volatility surface. So if I crush this down and just look at a couple cycles to make it easier to see, you'll notice that I can see a lot of different things by looking at the surface. I can see the relative volatility between expiration cycles at the same strike. I can see if certain strikes have really high implied volatility like these do right here, the 22s compared to something like the 23s. And that could be for a bunch of different reason. I can also look and see if the general out of the money puts are more expensive in terms of vol than the out of the money calls. If I see this kind of smile that has higher put IV that tells us that the market is pricing in more severity to the downside, but a higher probability move to the upside. And to show you an example",

And to show you an example of what this can look like reversed. If we look at something like GameStop and we take a look at the 21 March in 17 April, what do you notice difference? The calls are way higher than the puts. So a lot we can pull from these. These are two of the very, very basic but really useful starter ways to use the options chain for information. As always, if you have any questions, let me know, be an outlier. See you later.",
