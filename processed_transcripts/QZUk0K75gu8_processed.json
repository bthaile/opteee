    "text": "What's up, everybody? Welcome back to another episode of the Outlier podcast. I have my friend, Tom Bassow, back hanging out with us really to ring out the year. This was the last full trading day of 2023. So stoked to finish the year off with you. Thanks for hanging out. Yeah, I just finished up my afternoon run 10 minutes before we got on. So yeah, this is the end of the year. They had it the long weekend now. How was how was your run? What'd you do? Oh, I just did. I had a down day today, but it was a pretty good year. Yeah, that's absolutely awesome. So when you look back at 2023, what stuck out to you? What was anomalous? And the reason why I asked that question is because you've seen a lot of markets, right? So I started trading in 2007 myself, and I know that you've seen much more than I have. So I'm always curious to see what kind of things stuck out to different people with different reference ranges. I think I guess the two major things I noticed was that I completely would have never predicted that the stock market would be almost at new highs at the end of the year. I figured the economy was probably going to go into a more of a hard landing, not a soft landing. And I still don't know that we're going to have a soft landing. I think that's",

And I still don't know that we're going to have a soft landing. I think that's the jury's out still a little bit on that. So we'll see next year how that works out. But the one thing that surprised me is the strike to the stock market because it seems to be running on fumes almost some indicators that are strange. I have a stock index trading strategy. And despite the fact that on the last five, six days, the market has made highs each day up to today. So through yesterday, I noticed that I couldn't get any of my overbought oversold indicators to overbought. I thought that was interesting. It's kind of like the strength isn't there to really peg the indicators out, but it keeps trying to hang on and go up more. Today, of course, it didn't. And we'll see whether that spills over and a lot of tax selling next year or early or what. That was the one thing that was interesting. And that really propelled some of my returns for the year. I wouldn't have expected it. The other thing that was I thought strange and quite profitable and very good for me was that the all-weather strategy trades like 26 different futures markets.

So all of a sudden, it turns around, goes the other way and you make a bunch of money the other direction. Coffee had some big moves. A lot of the soft commodities had some just really violent, just crazy stuff. So that's been helpful for profits. The rest of the stuff, you know, just as a worth worrying about, there were some profitable trades and losers all came out in the wash. I think the big highlights were the some of the soft commodities moves that we saw and then some of the in the stock market through the year end. When you look at your returns for the year, what was the primary driver of the performance? Like a joke around say trends. Trends were the driver. If you have a trend, you can make money if you don't have a trend, you can't. Mostly, I'd say the stocks at the end of the year were huge.

The ones that got stopped out, I had to get back in. They're mildly profitable, but through the year end, that was one big area. And the other area, I believe, was the futures. The commodities really had some strange stuff. I mean, you had wheat doing weird things with Ukraine. You had orange juice, crazy coffee, had some crazy stuff. There's been some very interesting moves in the commodity. So that's been very profitable, because the trends are hanging around long enough where you had really coins money off of them. That's probably the two major areas I thought there was quite a little driver of profits. Another question I had for you is what did you make of the move in the beginning of the year?

I, I saw that as a feeble attempt to try to get a bull market going or bull move going and it failing and it stopped out about half of my positions. The hedges actually went on. So I was hedged for a little bit there and then I got whipsod out of the hedge and all the long started coming back in and all of a sudden right now I am 30 out of 30 sectors long. Everything is long. It's clearly that early move was fake out and a test and then then we got back on the train and right through the end of the year it was been just a crazy move up, I think. I have no idea whether it'll be able to hang on in the next year. I'm not going to even bother predicting because it doesn't make any difference for those who want to try to predict. I'd say that all",

I'm not going to even bother predicting because it doesn't make any difference for those who want to try to predict. I'd say that all I would worry about is to be ready to react quickly, expect potential for it moving very fast because there's so many people with so many profits built up, so many nervous knellies about what might happen. If you get some tax selling causing it to be loose early going here and then any kind of incident just out of the blue something happens economically, the fed, the wars that we seem to be in, anything could touch off the flame and then all of a sudden man that everybody would be trying to get out the door at the same time, it could get ugly. So I just be very careful here. It just seems to me like there's so much volatility and so much potential for disaster. I just enjoy the ride while you can to the upside and be prepared to do the other if you have to.

There were IPOs were coming out and they'd rate a company hundreds of millions or billions of dollars and they hadn't even made a profit yet. It was just insanity and you know you looked at that and everybody said well yeah this has never happened before and it is very overbought but it's a new it's a new market you know this is never happened before because we never had all this technology that's going to change our lives and all this stuff and eventually the profits will come and the lesson to be learned is the tech stocks ended up going down 80 shortly thereafter.

One other question I had for you is this year when we saw some of the weakness in the broad market like the SP 500 something like the queues and tech just kept plugging away and when I see how heavily anticipated the integration of AI is and I am a believer that it's the kind of thing that is a massive unlock for tons of things but it's obviously very early and we still don't really know how it's going to be integrated and regulated. But I'm curious if you think going into 2024 if you start to see some of that weakness that you're thinking of would that lead you then to essentially rotate over short equities writ large or do you still hold bastions that might still be performing well like tech that could be fueled by AI. On my Nasdaq trading I would just go short that's I go longer short all the time so if it goes over to the downside and I run that on a 90 indicator it'll go short pretty quickly and if the thing falls apart and gets really ugly I will just coin money with that strategy. In cryptos if the Nasdaq type companies the tech companies start going to the downside it seems over time cryptos and tech have been related to each other except recently so it's been interesting there's been some different things happening in the crypto world",
