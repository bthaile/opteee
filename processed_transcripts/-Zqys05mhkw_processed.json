    "text": "What's up outliers? Today's video is going to be talking about the covered strangle in GameStop. This is actually going to be a practical application. I've taken part of my holdings in GameStop. And I am turning it into an example for us to follow. So a while ago during a live stream, we took a look at GameStop together of Saturday Live Stream. And I asked, what is the average holding size for GameStop? And I looked through the chat and I picked a regularly occurring number or range within there. And what I did was take a portion of my GameStop holdings. And I'm tracking them desperately from the rest of the portfolio. And I'm going to show you how we can trade something. I can trade something specifically like the covered strangle in GameStop, which is one of my staple option strategies. There's a very specific use case in GameStop that applies beautifully. But first, let's start with a quick recap of what the covered strangle is. Now, I have a couple videos. I have an entire playlist, actually. About this specific strategy, because it's one that I use a lot. So I'm going to link to those in the notes below for your viewing pleasure if you want to get a little further into detail. But I'm going to give you a quick overview of what the covered strangle is. And then why this fits so well with something like GameStop. So first things first, what",

As you can tell by my very neat handwriting, it is long shares plus hash secured puts, short puts plus ratio short calls against the long shares. So let's take a look at what this actually looks like. And if you can't tell what these are, these are the risk profiles. This shows you what, which, what each of these individual positions looks like. And then I will show you what the composite looks like. So I have this pulled up in my pass through IRA account. So I'm recreating the position here with the current basis that I have for these different things. So the position itself is already on. Now, at the end of this video, I actually want you to comment what allocation you think I should use for this example. My game plan is to run this example at least for a quarter and do like a weekly update about it. Could go longer. It's however long we decide that it's interesting.

Now to that note, I'm specifically trying to pick an amount of money or the allocation that is applicable to as many people as I possibly can. It's why I picked so far a very small amount of money. But we can modify it to be whatever we would like it to be. Now, for me, as I've already explained, GameStop is a very small part of my portfolio. And the main reason why I started holding the shares, like specifically holding the GameStop shares, was really just a participate and to show some love for what the apes are doing. Because I still very much consider myself aghast. But I'm a fan, so I like to try to support where I can. Now, what I did was pick an amount of money, 15,000 dollars is what I'm using right now. And that's based on that live stream. And I pulled some of my shares over. And I'm tracking them and I'll show you how I'm tracking them.

However, I picked a bit of a midpoint on the chart so that I can track essentially from the period of somebody scaling in during this up move, taking us back to towards the beginning of November. So that's where that basis comes from. Now, if we go back to this tab, this is what long shares look. It's essentially a positive sloping line that moves one for one dollar for dollar with the underline. So pretty straightforward. Now, if I show you the short put component by itself, you'll see that it has capped profit potential, uncapped risk to the downside. Same thing with the other put when you overlay the two different puts, it develops a slightly curved line because of the different expressions and the different strikes, but it's essentially the same. Apped profit potential undefined risk to the downside. Then if we add short calls by themselves, you'll see that we have risk to the upside and defined profit to the downside. Now, the ensemble of all of these put together is very purposeful. So the basis for the coverage triangle with respect to what we're doing here is very specific to those that are holding shares of game stop already that just want to hold the stock.

And the way that I look at trading the coverage triangle is for those kinds of people that would like to hold the stock anyways. It is a method to make a little bit more money on something that you're going to hold anyways. So we start with our 200 shares. We layer on that short call. Notice how it's only one short call against the 200 shares. This is for two primary reasons. One, it makes sure I do not have capped upside if I chose to exit the trade as a whole, meaning I close the call. I close the shares at the same time, exit the whole thing. The other thing is it gives me more ability to manage these calls should they wind up in the money. And that will be a further video for when it hopefully eventually happens. And I can walk you through how I can avoid being assigned on these calls, although it is always a risk, which is why I keep it at a ratio, because I don't actually want the shares to go away. It's always a risk. But we can do things to minimize it, which, again, is we get into the management of the position and the strategy, and you'll see",

But we can do things to minimize it, which, again, is we get into the management of the position and the strategy, and you'll see more of that. And then we have additional short puts on beyond just the long shares. And there's a reason why these short puts work so well in something like GameStop. So this is what the entire position looks like on a risk profile by itself. Pretty simple. It maintains a upwards sloping line. So it still has unlimited profit potential. And it maintains the downside cap is whatever we put into the trade essentially. So it's planning for in this scenario that going to zero. This trade would lose 12,000 to 244 bucks, something like that. That's if GameStop wants zero, which right now doesn't look like it's going to do. So let's now take a look at why the covered Strangle in GameStop. Well, there's a few things that contribute really, really well. The way that I trade GameStop directionally is very different than what I'm showing you here. Again, the covered strangle in this context is designed for something that you would want to hold anyways.

Now, the way that I trade it when it's moving around a lot I'll use single options and trade the actual direction. The purpose of this strategy is to optimize and existing holding position of stock. So the base position in the covered strangle is long shares. And then the options are just to amplify the position. GameStop presents a really interesting opportunity because it's very, very high volatility. And the options positions that we use in the strategy are both short options positions. So it means we're selling. We're selling options in something that is very high volatility. That means that you're going to make a lot more money on a relative basis compared to selling options on something with lower volatility. You're also taking advantage of some structural components of volatility, things like volatility risk premium VRP. Now, that sounds a little heavy, but it's a very simple concept. If we take a look at this chart of GameStop, you'll notice this is volatility. This yellow line is implied volatility for a 30-day time frame. This gray line is one month vault 21 days technically, but it's also one month vault. So both yellow and gray are one month vaults. Notice how in general implied volatility is higher than realized volatility. In general, when you sell options, you capture some of this, depending on how you structure the trade",

Notice how in general implied volatility is higher than realized volatility. In general, when you sell options, you capture some of this, depending on how you structure the trade and manage it. But in general, when you're selling options, if implied volatility remains elevated, it means that you are collecting more premium than the underlying is actually moving. So there's an edge baked into this from the options perspective, which is why something like GameStop is so advantageous. It has 110 IV, that's for a 30-day time frame. The implied vaults, let me present I was 53. So it's very, very high volatility. And for comparison, if this doesn't make a lot of sense, do you'll see a look at Apple, AAPO? Apple is 26.6 volt. This is a 68 implied volatility percentile. implied volatility percentile is a really simple metric that plots all of the previous for the last year, implied volatility numbers against the current implied volatility. And this simply tells you that the current level of vault is higher than 68 of the time. This is very high. So then if we go to GameStop by comparison, it's almost quadruple plus the volatility from on average. Right now, vaults actually a little bit low in here. But it's 110 volt compared to 25 volt.

    "text": "very high. So then if we go to GameStop by comparison, it's almost quadruple plus the volatility from on average. Right now, vaults actually a little bit low in here. But it's 110 volt compared to 25 volt. And notice how implied volatility percentile is lower, even though this is so much higher than Apple. It means that on an average basis, GameStop is way more volatile. So you can capture that via short options. Now, there is another great benefit to trading the coverage triangle on something like GameStop. And it's because of this short call component. And I'll explain why. Hypically speaking, when we are selling options, options most often will exhibit what is called let's skew. That means that the puts are priced more richly compared to the corresponding out of the money call. So let's take a look and see if that's the case in Apple. Actually, don't know. I haven't looked yet. So a 29 delta put 36 days out. The vault in here is 26.9. 26.99 call 27. That's for the 29 delta. There's no 29 delta call. There's a 31. So let's see what the 31 is. The 31 is 23.75. So even though this is an even higher delta, notice that this volatility is much higher on the put side than the call side. That is because the market tends to price puts more expensively than calls. And that's because the market's tend to crash down. And they kind of slowly go",

Let's take a look at GameStop. Now before we do that, let's just mentally note what the difference is. This is in terms of vault 23.7 against 27. So about 4.ish. So now let's take a look at GameStop. And let's do the same thing around a 30 delta. So I see a 29 delta here. These are running an 87.2 vault. This is at a 29 delta. If we could find a 29 on this side. 29 delta on this side is 143.37. Notice how psychotically high that is compared to the same put. And notice how it's completely different than what I just showed you an apple. And what you saw an apple is normal. This is abnormal. You do not see calls priced as richly as they are on a relative basis against puts in most tickers. This is because the market fears the upside and GameStop. And it's pricing those really big swings that it has. So this goes all the way back to the opportunity. Because GameStop is high volatility, you're going to benefit on the short puts.

Because GameStop is high volatility, you're going to benefit on the short puts. Because GameStop uniquely has exceedingly high vault salinity on the call side, rather than what you typically get in the coverage triangle on like an index ETF, the calls don't really help you that much. Because you collect a little bit on them. But there's not a lot of vault in them on a relative basis to the puts in GameStop. It's the opposite. You make a lot of money on a relative basis by selling the calls. So this is a really lucrative selling position that, again, is based on the premise that we just want to hold the stock anyways because the short puts are cash secured. So what this means is if the stock expires below my strike on the puts, there are things we can do to manage to avoid getting assigned there. We can roll out and down, which we'll probably do, all of that at some point. But you want to own the stock anyways. And this isn't like the superficial people that sell a put and they collect the premium and they say, oh, I want to buy the stock anyways.

And then the stock plumets and they're like, wait a minute, I don't actually want the stock. It's, I'm beyond that. I've thought through that enough. I've seen enough of these cycles that when I'm selling these puts at spots that I actually would want to be assigned, I'm selling them pretty aggressively, closer to at the money. So that's why it's something that you want to hold anyways. The difference is let's say we're using a 15,000 position. Rather than going into the long shares and just buying all 15,000 worth, we may be due a little bit less. Maybe 10,000 worth or less than that. And then get the rest of you of those short puts so that you can capture some of that premium, particularly when the underlying is doing stuff like this, kind of trending sideways or even coming down a little bit. So let's talk about the management plan. The risk in my GameStop coverage triangle is defined by size, the allocation. That means that I would be completely okay and comfortable if GameStop went to zero, meaning my entire investment is lost.

So my risk is defined by the allocation. Again, not my normal, but when I'm trading the coverage triangle, that's generally the case. Now if I'm trading the coverage triangle on something like a leveraged ETF, I normally apply some sort of trend following different scenario. So that's the risk management perspective. Now I do not intend to unwind the shares unless we're in the process of a squeeze. And I would define that as any sort of movement similar to this, where we're seeing volume jacking, we're seeing price double triple plus at least doubling. So that means from current steady state right now, I wouldn't unwind any shares until it is at least above 50, probably closer to 60.

They don't last forever. They actually typically last barely briefly. So what I'm doing is I'm setting targets based on double current price. So double current price starts to open unwind potential for the shares. So that's the upside. Now the next management component is how am I deciding between selling puts versus buying shares. And it's buy price direction in standard analysis. If I see price doing what it's doing now, trending sideways, this period in here is via short puts. Then if we had a period like this, or it's more aggressively rising, I would take some of the short puts in and buy the shares outright. Because I will make more money on the move as it goes.

So now let's take a look at the actual positions as they are as I've pulled them over. So I started doing this on the eighth of November is when I marked the shares that I took over from the other part of the portfolio. It wasn't really trading the coverage triangle in it then as you could tell, this is eight November and we don't actually start with the options component for this example until mid December. But that's where we're picking up from. So and this is just to show you an example. I intend to wipe the slate clean and start the year with just the shares. So right now we have a 15,000 allocation and the current requirement is 13K. So we are 89 utilized. For the example period of where I got in, not where I started trading options and actually trading the coverage triangle, which is 18 December. I'm using the price from here on eight November.

The strategy as it sits as I run it is returned 29.2. So several points variance over this and I have realized gains as part of what I'm doing. And again, I wanna try to hone the point that I'm using this start date of eight November but I didn't start the options component until a month and a half later. So this would be much better off if I use the comparison from 18 December to now but I'm using from when I got the shares. So I've had a couple short puts that have come down for super cheap nothing really to write home about. And from the call side, we still have the initial offering that's set out at the 35s. So this is what the position looks like now and this is what I will show you as we move forward and as we continue to manage and work around the position. I will be managing all of these as I would any other trade. Again, we have 200 shares at 2431 and we have two contracts of the 21 Feb 28s. We have one contract of the 24 Jan 29s here and then we have one contract of the 17 Jan 35s. So that's what it sits as today and then like I said, going forward, I will give you",

So that's what it sits as today and then like I said, going forward, I will give you weekly updates on this, what's happening, how it's going, management, all that kind of stuff. The last thing I need from you though is I need you to let me know in the comments is how much money do we want to use for the allocation? I can pair this down, I can scale this up. I want to drive home the point. I don't want to just do whatever number you guys think would be cool. I want to specifically pick a number that is meaningful to you. So if you have a smaller account, I want this to be relevant to you so that you have an example of what this can look like for a very basic strategy in something like a desktop. So I realize that these are these need to be 24 instead of 25. Those were all messed up. So that's the game plan. Let me know in the comments what you think we should do what's most relevant to you and then we will see what we can do. If you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.",
