I want to spend a little time going through the bed bath and beyond case because I think that that's generally interesting. And then there was a couple other questions that we got in the discord that I want to hit. And as always, whatever you all decide that we should talk about, we should take a look. So anything that you want to hit throat in the chat, we can dip dive, duck, dodge and dodge any direction that we want, dive into whatever. Unfortunately, our boy Newton is still slightly under the weather. So he and I were texting to figure out when we want to do our next session, but he's just looking to kind of, you know, take it easy this weekend, rightfully. So he's been working a lot now and live streams, I love him, but they do kind of require a lot of focus in order for it to be kind of a good conversation, right? So he's keeping it chill for himself. So make sure you all send your best wishes to our boy Newton. And I were talking a little bit, he actually had a couple recommendations. I always like to talk to him about what he thinks we should take a look at. And he had two things that he brought up. He thinks we should take a look at Causing Chewie. And then he",

So I think we will dive through those. Also, we have somebody in the chat name, California pizza is best, who you, you just know that probably a great person, but they are just trying to start some shit is what I think because it is objectively probably some of the worst pizza I've ever had. I've had better pizza in Las Vegas than I've had in California. And I'm from New York. So I do have a lot of respect. And that's where I think the best pizza is I would not call it California by any stretch of the imagination, but I have to imagine our friend California pizza is best knows exactly what they're doing. So shout out to them for ruffling people's feathers because that can always be kind of fun. All right, let's see who we got in the chat. I see PFA, Nola, Ron, ape of spades.

So it's a little easier for me to keep up with you guys. Mark says, John's of bleaker best pizza in New York City. I don't I'm not sure if I've had theirs before, but I think really when it comes down to where the best pizza actually is a lot of it comes down to like what hits up like nostalgia metrics because I remember as a kid, my favorite place was Tommy's in in the Bronx. Love that place. But yeah, I think a lot of it also comes down to like just what yeah, like what nostalgia buttons get hit. Snehill, Veyha says, sir, no, Richard Newton.

And I think the conversation that they had was fascinating because it was a really good mix of shit that was about Cohen specifically, his background, him as a person. But then there was a lot of stuff that we got to talk about the way that he thinks about business and the way that he does things, which is really cool. This is actually where I learned a lot about his tweeting and his tweets now to me, they make, they make so much more sense. So if I grab Cohen's Twitter, if you go through that podcast and then you look at his Twitter, I mean, it literally lines up perfectly. The fact that he did this, the fact that I think he changed this a few times that used to be, I forgot, he had like two different versions in his bio. One of them was like, she heard something and then the other one I think he had was like, unemployable or something. I forgot exactly what it was. Again, you guys probably would know better than me.

So like this, the Kamala coffee and the Trump coffee and what they are absolute joke, Kamala 2069, absolute joke, this absolute, like he's just, he's literally just playing games and it's hilarious. Because when I listen to this interview, it made way more sense. Like the dude just doesn't take the stuff that's seriously. He actually reminds me a lot of Musk in the sense that like they're obviously very successful people that actually think that like the system in the game is kind of bullshit and they don't want to play like the corporate game by standard corporate game rules and they like moving around a little bit more freely and just calling the nonsense as it is. Like that's some of what I see. And it's, it's just so refreshing. So I bring all of this to context because when I'm looking through like this stuff and then I start reading through the the deposition a little bit again, I'm like I'm developing a deeper and deeper understanding of how this thing all works for him and the way that he thinks about things because I think it's",

So it's admittedly a small part of my portfolio, but nonetheless, I still care about the performance. I don't hold stock in pretty much anything. I trade options. So there's a few things I hold stock in and it's again, I remind you guys a lot of it is to like support the movement and it's to participate, right? Because when there's something cool that's happening, I like to try to contribute to it the way that I can. But in my DNA, I'm a trader man. Like I'm always going to be a trader. It's how I do what I do. I started in 2007. It's not going to change for me. It's how I make a living. So there's like the trading part of me that does stuff.

You all know collectively, definitely far more than I know about this whole thing. So because of that, I want to poke through some things that I did see that were pretty interesting though. So as you can see that this case started in 23 August of 22. And from my understanding, and again, please help me understand if I'm wrong. That's really the whole point of doing these in a live session specifically in these instances is because it helps me learn as well. And not here just to teach the elements that I know.

And I started just getting infatuated with the background of this whole thing because it is such a fascinating place to be. The way that I approach markets is so different than this. So all of that context is to say most of this is not my strength. There's pieces of this that I can definitely talk about very strong. Well, but there's a lot of it that I don't know. So anyways, going back to this, I was trying to understand even the origin of this, which it really seemed to amounts to some sort of stock market manipulation pump and dump.

Again, this stock moves so differently than normal stocks. And for somebody like me that's been in markets for so long, coming across products that do that is so intriguing. Like there's no other way for me to describe it than pure intrigue to see things. It's like if you play a sport, right, if you're a martial artist and you think about certain movements, movement patterns, there are things that are generally universal. But then every once in a while, somebody will come up and do things completely different. So that's kind of like a John Jones kind of fighter who's not really perfect at anything, but he's really good at most things. And he's super creative or like a Mikey Musamechi from a Jiu-Jitsu world. Like they move differently than like the standard. And it's part of what makes them so intriguing. So when I look at GameStop, it's that. It's absolutely intriguing the way that the thing works. So Gasewag says I feel like you could trade GME pretty consistently, but not your portfolio. Yeah, absolutely. I think that's a completely fair statement. I think traders have to figure out what's right for them. So like for example, if I look at GME and the way that GME has been moving, the notion of could it be traded? Absolutely. This",

But when I look at something like GameStop, could I trade this here? Of course, I could always trade something if I'm so inclined. But the question I think a trader has to ask themselves is not like, could I conceivably place a trade in this? Could I conceivably place a trade? Yes. The question realistically is where is the best place for my money? That's what I care about as a trader. So to me, the question when I look at something like GameStop or any other opportunity is not, could I trade this at this point? I can structure a trade for anything. But it's where is the best possible place for my money? And it's not just in terms of where can I make the most money? Where's the best return?

Somebody could easily focus only on GameStop. That is completely possible. But it's a really tough way to make money in general for a trader. For an investor, it's definitely a different story. Investors have to do whatever's right for them. But even somebody like Roy and Kitty, that's one of the reasons why I'm so fascinated by him because he is an outlier. He's a true outlier in the way that he approaches markets and the way that he approaches money and the way that he runs trades. And he's been extremely fortunate. I will again, keep it a buck. The dude's smart. He's super smart. But the thing about the way that he's been able to grow his money is that it's not even just about being smart. It's also a lot about fortune. Like how much luck is involved with how positions happen to be built at given different point in time. Now for him, he's obviously sustained the approach for some time. So it shows that I would argue it's more skill than luck. But there's still a healthy dose of luck. So with stuff like that, like looking at",

Again, like you can tell from the way that I typically present content to you guys. I'm very specific when I'm talking about something as an opinion, I literally will say in my opinion very purposefully so that you know that is my brain interpolating information and coming up with what I think. But there's also a difference between like objective information. So that's what I aim to align with on this specifically is what is the objective information? What is the origin of this thing as it sits? So the lead plaintiff, this homie, individually and on all other person situated. So from my understanding, stuff like this happens when there's going to be some sort of potential class action suit, bigger suit, but they pick a lead plaintiff. And then they represent all their people that are in similar scenarios. So from my understanding, they'll typically do this so that they have obviously a focal point to work with, but they'll also try to find somebody that like represents the case. Well, the most recent case against roaring kitty that was filed. I think on a Friday and it was dropped on the Monday, which was really interesting. I did a video on that a while ago.

That was a similar scenario where they picked somebody to be kind of like the lead in that case, but I thought the lead for that case was really, really weak. So I'm actually very curious how strong this lead is in this case because yeah, I think that's kind of an important, I don't want to say that important, but it is kind of an important factor to have somebody that represents it that has, I don't want to call it like a more exaggerated story, but definitely more severe story would make sense. So let's see, the within allegations based upon the investigation conducted through the plaintiff, they reviewed analysis of Ryan Cohen, Arnalg Gustavo's public filings with the SEC, press releases, public report news articles, research reports, so on and so forth. So this is a federal securities class action brought on behalf of those folks who purchase stock from within the time frame, essentially that they're referencing. And it says the plaintiff brings action, derivative action within the meaning of rule that. So this is kind of just the foundation for the case writ large.

And then they lost 106 thousand dollars. First off, I boo fucking who, crime me a river, but that part of side, let's see what they say. Canadian citizen called by media is the meme stock champion. Is that accurate? Is this, is this true? Like is this actually what he's generally known as the meme stock champion? I've heard of him. I know like Elon calls himself like the meme stock king or some shit like that, but I don't know about the, the meme stock champion. What does that make sense to you guys? I think we should be back up. My bad. We just took, we took a little hiatus. You know how it goes. I think I messed up something in, in OBS. Okay. So Paul says full iceberg. Well, all right.

Oh, shit. They're getting right into the meat and potatoes. Has employed pump and dump scheme to raises a much capital and ignited several meme stocks to draw dropping heights. He served as chairman of game stops boards in January 21 and throughout the class period. So that's also fascinating. Now, obviously they have to come out with their forks and knives in order to start getting something spicy going here. But when I'm reading this, I think that they kind of forget quite a lot that he can't like he can't actually do this that well. The problem with larger float stocks is that they're difficult to manipulate. That's why traders like me tend to not trade penny stocks. So if you've ever been in any of my like my weekly update live streams, whenever people bring up, you know, penny stocks, I'm always not about it. And it's because like I can't really trade it. And they're really prone to manipulation. So Evergreen says more on alert. Yeah, I mean, I don't think you're wrong, brother. I'm probably fall squarely into that category.

But back to this, it's difficult to actually run some sort of broad pump and dump on something like this in my opinion. So could it be done? I absolutely think so. But I think it's would be really difficult. There was a recent case. I'm not sure if you all are familiar with it. But there was an entity. I'm not going to name them because I don't want to give them any undue press. And the entity though, they were like straight up running pump and dumps. And it was clear to see if there was like very clear messaging behind it that they got from fact finding. So yeah, I mean, that's like a clear example of pump and dump. I think this is a really difficult argument for them to make here. But when somebody has a lot of money, a lot of times they're not necessarily trying to position something that is super solid enough to go through and win a trial. Because really, if they can get them to settle ahead of time because they don't want to go to trial or whatever else, that's what this is for. So even if this case is not the strongest thing based on our opinion",

Now for those that don't know from my understanding somebody like Ryan Cohen seems to just realize the chair was like screwing up the background remover. Ryan Cohen seems to like to intervene in seller boxing which seller boxing is a man it's an interesting business practice but it's essentially to not go super far in the weeds. It's a predatory business practice where you attempt to extract is much money from a company before it goes bankrupt. And the reason why you do that is because if you essentially extract as much value as possible and then you short sell something and then it goes bankrupt you don't have a tax footprint. There's you don't owe anything because the entity is gone. So there's an incentive for this predatory practice and essentially the way it works is investors of different sorts sometimes in goods with a broker of some sort.

So that's why they're incentivized to do stuff like this. Now for somebody like Ryan Cohen if you're able to turn the company around it leads to stuff like this to squeezes and it leads to movements that force the other side of the trade that was shorting it to get out of their trade and it can make a shit on of money to the upside. Now it's very very much difficult in order to make that kind of turnaround but if you are able to make that kind of turnaround you can make a ton of money and I think Cohen started getting more into this activist investor role because of some of the possibilities there.

Alan says real quick can you explain for me how to buy shares of GME on the lot market? I've seen a lot of talk about retail traders orders not making it to a lit market. Okay you meant lit market. Yeah. So depending on who your broker is you can choose where to route your order. So again I don't know who your broker is but if you choose order routing then you can essentially determine where you want it to go so that it's not gone through a market maker. So if you use something like the ice it's an electronic exchange. You can change the routing of your order so that it's not being fulfilled through a market maker that kind of thing. Cedric says oh shit this guy's USMC. Yes sir that is exactly what all that paraphernalia is that you see in the background. Roaring Titi says i.e. X I think yeah so you can take a look at a couple different ones.

I would rather use a fucking notepad that I mail to people then using Robinhood and supporting that business.

There's just no way so the main thing you want to look up though is like specific to your broker once you get an actual broker is just how to route orders directly to the exchange. So if you route orders directly to an exchange you're now bypassing the market maker and you don't really need to you don't have to have your order internalized so yeah that's what you can do there for that.

Freena who is obviously Cohen's attorney says objection form witness no I don't remember well let me back up a little bit did you delete the tweet and then so right like they're trying to box him in just even on this stupid little thing the other thing to know about depositions is that it is literally it's just a war of attrition they have a certain amount of time that they can spend with people and their goal is to ask the same question in as many permutations as they can and part of it is just become it becomes like a metronome you feel like your answer in the same thing or you feel like you fully answered a question but in the attorneys mind you haven't because they want to close out the question so that's why you'll see stuff",
