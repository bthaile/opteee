    "text": "Creating your goals is a trader is really important. So what do you try to achieve at the end of the year? Do you want a 10 return, a 20 return, a 30 return? Here's the fun fact. If you have no trading track record, you don't get to pick what you want. Because you have nothing to base it off of. If it's your first year of trading and you're saying, I don't know what to pick, I want 20. Sure, you can want that all you want. But is it possible for you? Is that within your skill set at that time? Maybe maybe not. You'll have to figure it out. So what I would do if I were starting again is for my first two years of trading, I would just target make money. Be greater than zero. Then over time you can refine your target to be more specific to what you want. Your first couple years, it's just to learn. So don't get it confused. Where in the beginning you're like, I want to earn this really high return. It's entirely based on your skill sets. Not what you want. Be an outlier. See you later.",
