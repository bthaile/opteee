    "text": "the out performance I saw in vix in 2020 relative to hedging again via puts of different Deltas of different expirations in the in the in the indices himself was because we had such a prolonged period of low volatility leading into 2020 if they were just outrageously cheap comparatively or if that's you know kind of just general behavior for them it's really hard to tell the people analyzing things like that is we just don't have many examples right I mean the fix has only been around since 1990 it's only been tradable since 2003 so we haven't had many sort of genuine panics so we anyone who claims that's one of those things I'll be like maybe I can't claim to know because no one can claim to know we haven't had enough evidence to do it I would say that just because vol's low doesn't mean it's a good time to buy it because it can stay low for a very long time like Vol was exceptionally low for like three years in the 2000s so if you decided that you're going to buy the vix because it was a 12 even though the Vex I don't know if it's trading back in I mean you would you would pay carry on that for four years before you would have made money so it's one of those things that timing is really important right and I and I think that's kind of the the general hypothesis",
