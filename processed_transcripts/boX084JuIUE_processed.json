    "text": "Decrease your commissions in just a couple steps. You should absolutely negotiate with your broker. You reach out to them and you look for a discount on your commissions There's a few things you can ask for the first one is a volume based discount You can say hey, I trade with you guys this many contracts of options in a given month I'm looking for a discount based on how much I trade and they might say yes. They might say no This second way you can negotiate with them is by saying hey, I have X number of dollars with you guys I'm looking for a competitive broker. I'm shopping around. I actually have some decent offers in terms of commissions from another broker I don't want to move over there if you guys are able to lower your rates and Standard negotiation tactics apply here. You should try to get them to say a number first and see what it is And then use that as your anchor point. We have nothing to lose because the worst case scenario is they say no We're not gonna lower your rates and then if you don't want to leave don't leave yet But you absolutely should try to negotiate being out like your savior self some money. See you later",
