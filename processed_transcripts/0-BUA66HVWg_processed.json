    "text": "Let's up everyone. We're on the mobile setup, figured expiration day, time to take a look at game stop and see what's going on and I think to everybody's the light. We are above 30. And for those, well, I think everybody has to be aware of by now, but we also did get a visit from the cat. Key popped out on 25 December. What time did he post this at? 0 7 AM. So again, I don't know if that's a scheduled post or just like him being very, very specific with his timing, but he posted this and as per usual, I have no idea what it means. It seems, like maybe just Christmas posts, but lots of people are digging in and I saw people posting the the holer hex codes and then trying to figure out what that might mean. So if you have a theory on what this is, I actually would love to know because I don't know. And actually, let's poke through this really quick. It's trending and let's see what everybody says. Oh, it's because it's above 32, which is great. This person is talking about black rock adding. So it looks like everybody's stoked that we're above 30, which is absolutely great. Love that. Yep, perfect. And this is one of the things we talked about, truly, on one of our recent live streams, because GameStop here is really interesting to me because I know a lot of people thought",

And this is one of the things we talked about, truly, on one of our recent live streams, because GameStop here is really interesting to me because I know a lot of people thought that the 30 handle was going to be a bit of a challenge for it and it blew right through it and it's been steady above 30 ever since 23 December. It's been steady, steady, steady. Then even on the down tick today, although a really big candle, meaning the the wicks are big people are battling over price. It's still a very small body inside move and we cracked 32. So it wasn't even pushed down below 32, which is pretty interesting. And we expected some of this because the post-roaring kitty pop from his post on Christmas, which I genuinely do believe that's probably one of the larger catalysts here. And the reason for this move, both in mix of retail participants and then also probably algos getting involved. And as we've seen before, because we've seen when he posted that stuff about chewy and whatnot, I mean as soon as he posts, there's millions of volumes and seconds. So there's just that's not retail. That's way too fast. And today on the down tick post, it really hung within the shadow of the pirate candle, which is pretty interesting to me, because this means that even though",

And today on the down tick post, it really hung within the shadow of the pirate candle, which is pretty interesting to me, because this means that even though this had a pop based on that as a catalyst, the market is still kind of respecting it and it's not being rejected all the way back down. So if we take a look at a RSI, so this is using RSI along with a seven day moving average, we can see that RSI is at 61.55. And it's still above the moving average. And the moving average is a seven day V-watt moving average. So these are pretty effective for detecting downside, but someone it still looks to build. And the moving average is still upward sloping. Also, it's still very high, 62 and if we zoom this out to a year, we can see a few things. The main thing is there is a beast of a volume node now built at 2837 that range there. So this becomes like the new floor for a game stop, provided that there's not some sort of massive new information that changes the fundamentals of the company. This becomes like the accepted fundamental value floor of a company, because it's been transacting at this level for at least a month now. And it's not been pushed down even with its earnings.",

This becomes like the accepted fundamental value floor of a company, because it's been transacting at this level for at least a month now. And it's not been pushed down even with its earnings. It definitely had a bit of a down tick, but it performed okay during earnings because of interest earned on the cash court it's sitting on. So really really strong performance from games, that's why I see here. The fact that we're going on this and it kept it and it's still hanging above 30. It does look like 30 starts to become the next handle to beat. We can see there's two volume profiles. There's one here at 2836 where I'm sorry volume nodes on the volume profile. Then there's another here 2888, but this 30 handle looks to be pretty well respected. Now let's take a look at the options and really high near term wall. A short term wall is dips a lot and then we see it picking way back up on 17 Jan. And a big reason that you see the 17 Jan volatility like that is because there are a lot of options there. So right now there's 890,000 calls against 280,000 puts. And if we take a look at that 17 Jan literally half 428,000 calls are in the January exploration. So January is going to be spicy.

Now if we take a look at today's exploration first off, this is like the first time in a long time, we didn't have to pour one out for the 30s that expired out of the money and they're in the money and actually happy here. We can also see that the market had a call for the 31s because another 7,000 were added. So that means there's another at least 1000 added on top of this and then take a look at the volume of 32s 24,700 against 7960. So what that means is the overwhelming majority of this volume today was stacked onto these 32s and that kind of buying activity by the market makers likely is a contributing factor as to why price held so strong that it did because with that amount of volume coming in at the money on expiration date that forces essentially bit direct hedging activity in the open market in order to be able to cover these positions for those that are going to take a Simon on the shares. Now again, a lot of people will probably flatten out their positions to capture the profit. But there's a lot of people that",

Now again, a lot of people will probably flatten out their positions to capture the profit. But there's a lot of people that will be taking shares at 32 which looks really interesting to me. So now let's go out to 3 Jan really quick and see what's going on here. So it's 62k against 14. So 3 Jan is also really, really stacked on the call side. 10 Jan, 21k against 4700 less so. And let's take a look at volatility and see if we still have this standard. Let's look at the out of the money specifically. And I want to look and see if we have call skew. We don't on 3 Jan, we don't on 10 Jan and we don't on 17 Jan. So that's a little bit different that we have now put skew dominating a little bit more. There's the call skew finally 7 Fed pretty heavy call skew by the way. And then see anything here. And again a quick reminder of why I look at this call skew because it lets me see where the market is pricing in movements. So when I see heavy call skew to the upside it means that the market is expecting larger upside moves, which is why it prices those options more expensively because that's where the expectation is.",

So it's not until a bit further out in time, 17 April and then it's so it's essentially from that period on that we see the call skew which was what some Fed. Interesting. So the market is definitely pricing in further dated upside moves. But just not super near term. Volume today, 247,000 calls can spend 56,000 puts massive call volume a lot of call sales, which makes sense people closing their calls at a profit because there is pretty significant profit taking up toonities. Most of the volume as expected would be for today, 27 December, that's people either closing positions rolling them out or building new positions like we can see on those 32s that ended up expiring in the money. So really, really interesting. Now I also wanted to take a look at two other things. The general options flow that we saw for this past week. So we can see a few things that kind of stuck out to me. The first thing is there were a handful of wave further out in time massive puts being traded coming in at the offer. So these are people buying puts in the 120 expiration way out",

So these are people buying puts in the 120 expiration way out in 2026, 980,000, 892, 450. This is probably the same entity that's building into this position that would be my guess. But I mean, this is going on a little while now. We've seen these puts being tacked out here. Again, you can see being transacted at. So that's something I've been keeping an eye on. There's a lot of different reasons why that can be a target for people. It can be used for broader folio purposes depending on the entity and what they're holding. It can be done for directional speculation. So there's a lot of different ways that this can be used even to help with low-cates as part of synthetic positions we've seen now coming up a little bit more. So the size of these is interesting just because it doesn't represent a lot of shares. And when you're trying to use stuff for like low-cates and stuff like that, you wouldn't necessarily want to go out this far in time. And this isn't that big of a position. So if you're trying to acquire low-cates for a 50-lot, it's just really, really small, in order to do that. So to me, seems more of a",

And that was really the biggest trades that I saw come through. I always sort this by premium. And there wasn't a ton on the call side except we did have the 15s also out in 2026. And you can see that this is still over half a million dollars between these two positions, two minutes apart, probably the same entity I would feel pretty confident. Guessing at that. And then the other thing I wanted to say good quick look at is Max Payne. And you can see that Max Payne today was 2950 and we definitely closed deep within Max Payne again. Boomerminder. Max Payne does move throughout the day. But my guess is a lot of the hedging activity was probably done by the market makers, dropped this stock up a little bit more today, because they had to acquire a lot with those 20,000 plus contracts coming through. That's not an insignificant amount. So really, really strong day for a game stop, even though the broader market was down extensively, a game stop had a generally inside day which on a relative basis indicates strength. There was",
