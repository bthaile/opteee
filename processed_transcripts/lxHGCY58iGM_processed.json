Well, you're supposed to build successful businesses. But we never have an exit strategy. When somebody builds something and they tell me they have an exit strategy, I get really nervous about what they're building because then they're focusing on the exit strategy. We never have an exit strategy. We're just traders. So if somebody's willing to pay us maybe more than we think or worth, we'll listen. That's an exit strategy.",
