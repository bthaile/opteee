    "text": "Let's talk about a simple pre-trade checklist that I'm going to share with you all. The goal of this video is to give you the framework for a checklist that is in-depth enough to make sure that we're not making stupid errors, but not so in-depth that it won't be used. I found that to be a big problem for me when I first started trading is I would have all these great ideas on what I wanted to look at and what I thought was important. But then I'd run into the issue of, it became so burdensome that I wouldn't use it. So if something, although, might be super detailed and have everything that you could possibly need in it, it's completely useless if it's not usable. So this video is designed to strike a happy medium. I encourage you to add or remove things as you find suits your needs. The main thing I think about with pre-trade, post-trade checklists is that in the beginning, it should be a very manual process where we follow each step. But then over time, as you develop the skill set and the habits, you don't really have to have an actual checklist that you are tick boxing and filling out in that manner. I don't do that anymore myself, but I generally follow this process. So what's up everybody? Welcome back to all the outliers in a shout out to the Patreon family.

Welcome back to all the outliers in a shout out to the Patreon family. You guys make content like this, pause, so ball. So let's get straight to it. Up front, broad screen. So let me lay some context here. The idea behind this video and the pre-trade checklist is that you've already found a trade that you're interested in. So we found something that you want to put a position on and then this would be the next series of steps that go along with it. Now, quick admin note, if you aren't sure how to find a trade that you want to put on, I'll throw a video in the notes below that specifically dies into scanning for trades, but we are just moving on past that phase. So from a broad screening perspective, the very first thing is the product liquid. This is kind of the easiest exonerating factor for a trade and the way that I think about these kind of pre-trade checklists is this. Now, I'll give you a second to soak this in because I know that the artwork here might be overwhelming. It might spur some sort of visceral emotional reaction as you feast your eyes and gaze upon the greatness that is whatever this thing is. It's a work of art. But what",

But what I'm trying to show you is a funnel. So what I try to do is apply these big screening factors upfront so that I get rid of a bunch of stuff without wasting time. This is a really efficient way to go about looking at any sort of position. So liquidity is kind of the biggest thing I can put up top that will get rid of a ton of things right out of the gate. So if you find something that you really like but it's not liquid, too bad time to move on. Now, there are different ways you can gauge liquidity. Bit asks spread specifically for the options traders is an important concept here. So if we take a look at something like TLT, what you'll notice is on a standard expiration, a weekly expiration, it's a 98 product and the bit asks spread is essentially three cents, very small. And if you don't know what good liquidity looks like, there's a few things to keep an eyeball for. Obviously the bit asks spread, the number of shares that trade in a given day, open interest is another good indication whether or not it has weeklies because",

Obviously the bit asks spread, the number of shares that trade in a given day, open interest is another good indication whether or not it has weeklies because they won't offer weeklies unless there's demand for those expiration cycles, stuff like that. And you have to figure out what makes sense for you. The one thing I can make sure is important to share with you, not really sure if I can make sure makes sense, but one thing I can say unequivocally is that if something is not going through a volatile period, this is as good as it gets. And if volatility starts to spike, markets widen considerably. So if you're looking at something that's not going through a super volatile period and you're like, man, this is kind of a liquid, it gets insanely worse if volatility kicks up. So you should be aware of that when you're thinking about liquidity. Now, the next few things don't necessarily tell us whether or not the trade goes on or not, but it informs our decision and our thoughts about the trade. The first one is, does the individual product have any upcoming announcements? Does it have earnings coming up? And those are important details. For example, if you're like, oh man, I really want to put a trade on in FedEx for whatever reason. I love",

For example, if you're like, oh man, I really want to put a trade on in FedEx for whatever reason. I love it here. And you're not aware that it has earnings coming up. You are stepping in front of pretty significant risk and you're none the wiser. So when you're trading individual stocks, looking for earnings is important. Notice how on the last earnings cycle here, it had this big gap. You should be aware if something has earnings coming up. The main time I see this hurting traders is when they're looking for volatility. You're looking for your running scans that are looking for things with high implied volatility. And a lot of times that's going to be around an earnings event or an announcement of some sort. Maybe it's a biotech stock. And you don't connect those dots. And then all of a sudden, now you're putting a trade on that's going to take you through a binary event that's kind of a problem. The next thing is, are there any broad market events? This will impact trades differently, but you should be aware of what's coming up on the week ahead. A great tool to use for this. I really like them is called financial juice.

Now, the last thing here, before we get into the rest of the checklist, is what does my portfolio need? Now, when we're scanning for trades, I always have a big process that's driven by this. And this belongs in your pre-trade checklist as well. And the primary reason is this. If you find the greatest trade that you've ever found, but your portfolio doesn't need that risk, it doesn't go on. That's all there is to it. So it's important to make sure that we're always keeping this portfolio concept in mind when we're looking at these different trades. OK, cool. So the next step here is hypothesis, generation, and confirmation. For me at this stage, I already know what the trade is that I'm thinking about putting on loosely. I haven't gone through the details of structuring it. But a couple of things I want to make sure I'm considering. The first one is, is this some sort of opportunistic trade or am I looking for specific exposure and to make sure that this trade fits this question? And still fits within the broader portfolio.

This matters because the way that I size things, the way I scan for correlations for things, is really based on this. The next step here in hypothesis, generation, is what is your hypothesis, blanket, and how does the trade work? This is important because some traders have a hard time getting specific with this kind of stuff. And what I'm talking about is going back to this example, maybe you want to trade FedEx for some reason, and you think it's going to go up. Your hypothesis then would be, I am bullish in FedEx. I think it's going to go up potentially X number of points over the next X time frame. Those details are important specifically when you're trading options, because every single option of this trade you put on is time bound. So you have to get comfortable integrating a time element to your hypothesis. And this leads down to the next point, which is what is the breadth of analysis and does that line up with your hypothesis? So when you start going through this trade, again, for example, FedEx, we think it's going to go up. As I start overlaying my technical analysis, okay, I have an ascending nine day",

It's near a plus two linear aggression channel, which I wouldn't love, yada yada yada. The whole point here is you might look at something and make a judgment call, but it's super important to go much further into detail to see and make sure that the confluence of evidence that you're looking at marries up beautifully with whatever your hypothesis is. And sometimes you might find out that what you originally thought actually doesn't look that great. And if you need some ideas on how I go about technical analysis, you could check out this video here. And if you couldn't tell, this beautiful handwriting is actually from a free download, which I'll also throw that in the notes below for you to check out to get this exact pre-trade checklist.

So now we get through this initial hypothesis orientation and now we get into the details of fitting a strategy. So we're bullish in FedEx over two months. What structure makes the most sense for this and what of my corresponding strategies should I lean towards? Then from there, I need to go through my typical trade setup protocols. I need to allocate to the trade. I then need to design my scaling protocols. I need to determine how I'm going to clearly state if my hypothesis is correct or incorrect. This is a really important part of this process. So for me, if I am bullish in FedEx and I say, okay, I'm going to trade it via a ratio called diagonal and I am going to use, let's say there's no near-term resistance. So I'm going to give it a little bit of room to the downside and say if it drops below 270 near-term resistance, at least as far as I could see, then I know I'm wrong and I need to get out. This is creating a clear line in the sand on when I'm wrong. The other thing is time bound because again, options are time bound.

So if I'm trading a ratio called diagonal and I buy something that's 120 days out, I already know based on that strategy, I'm going to manage it once it gets to the 60 day window on the long options. So there's an inherent baked in time element as well that disproves the hypothesis. Because if this goes sideways for 60 days, that's still wrong. I'm wrong, my hypothesis is not correct. So if you don't have that baked into the strategy, you should absolutely consider adding both a price and time element to this hypothesis concept. And that's actually the next bullet point. Beautiful, it's almost as if this is what I do. You don't say. And the last part here is kind of dovetailing off the scaling, but it's preemptively thinking about how you intend to capture profits and manager losses. And for me, it's going to be based on defining both of these generally before I enter the trade. I'm very strict about the losses. I'm a little less strict on the profits on some strategies like trend following strategies. But if it's a various risk premium style strategy, I'm going to be very strict on this as well.
