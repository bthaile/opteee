    "text": "let's talk about a simple pre-trade checklist that I'm going to share with you all the goal of this video is to give you the framework for a checklist that is indepth enough to make sure that we're not making stupid errors but not so in depth that it won't be used I found that to be a big problem for me when I first started trading is I would have all these great ideas on what I wanted to look at and what I thought was important but then I'd run into the issue of it became so burdensome that I wouldn't use it so if something although might be super detailed and have everything that you could possibly need in it it's completely useless if it's not usable so this video is designed to strike a happy medium I encourage you to add or remove things as you find suits your needs the main thing I think about with pre-trade post-trade checklists is that in the beginning it should be a very manual process where we follow each step but then over time as you develop the skill set and the habits you don't really have to have an actual checklist that you are tick boox and filling out in that manner I don't do that anymore myself but I generally follow this process so what's up everybody welcome back to all the outliers and a shout out to the patreon family you guys make content like this",
