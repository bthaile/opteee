Exactly what you're looking at. When I pull this up and think or swim, it is the exact same thing that you're looking at. We have two different things that we can measure. Three, technically. We can measure volatility across terms. We can measure volatility across strikes. And we can measure volatility across strikes and terms. When we're looking at skew, skew again, pedantically, but skew technically is within a term. So what that looks like in this scenario is this specific, let's say 90 delta or 90 DTE. I wish you could highlight it. That would be nice if you hovered over and you can highlight it. But it doesn't let you. Let me see. I'm going to change the scale just a little bit that may be easier to see. Yeah, okay. That's fine. Just a yellow kind of fucking disappears on you. That's way better. This gives you relative volatility in a couple different ways. It gives you relative volatility across the strikes within an expiration across the strikes in different different expiration and then across the expiration themselves. When",

It gives you relative volatility across the strikes within an expiration across the strikes in different different expiration and then across the expiration themselves. When we're referring to skew, that's like looking at the individual lines. The 30 DTE, the 60 or the 90, and just looking at how the ball changes across the curve of a single term. And when we're talking about across terms, that's term structure, which probably tells you a little bit of like mental association. Term structure is across expiration. More importantly, again, than the words, the words genuinely don't matter that much. But realistically, a lot of times you'll actually hear traders just refer to it as a skew. And then you just know in the context of the conversation if it's within a term or cross terms. But you can learn a lot from something like skew. Let's take a look at spy and let's take a look at ball. I'm going to look at out of the money. The reason why we just look at out of the money is because we don't really care about the in the money options. There are balls are going to be slightly, I was trying to think of a different word, but skewed. So we use the out of the money's one word looking at stuff like this. This is",

So we use the out of the money's one word looking at stuff like this. This is a useful visual. Now the downside with the visual like this is you can kind of get lost. And unfortunately, think or swim doesn't like you scale this that well, which is kind of annoying. Being honest with you, I really would like it if you could like limit strikes and stuff. That would be a great version of this tool so that you can explore stuff because right now what's happening is the 19Ds. These insanely far out of the money puts, which are always going to have massively high vol are just crushing any relative difference that you can see between these. So if I get rid of that, you'll see these come more alive and you'll get a little more context. That's also why realistically speaking I use tools. I don't have it pulled up right now, but there's a few of them. I use and again, full disclosure, I'm going to fill it for I think all the ones I'm going to show you.

I like I like this one because it lets you view, you've all in a bunch of different ways. So you can look at the smile, which is just a term that we use to describe skew. More often than not, vol will have a smile, a smirk, and that's just the relationship that you see here. That's all. So this is one way that you can visualize it really in a bunch of different manners. They even have a vol surface, which I actually think is pretty cool that they do this to turn it into 3D. The reason I like this is again because you can get rid of the strikes that you don't want to see. So you can focus on the strikes that matter to you. So let's say that you're doing like 20% up and down from spot price. You can meaningfully drag these in so that you can see what's more relevant to what you're attempting to trade. And let's say that you're not interested going 700 days out. Let's say that you want to know what the structure looks like in a much near term window. Maybe like within 100 days.

    "text": "to trade. And let's say that you're not interested going 700 days out. Let's say that you want to know what the structure looks like in a much near term window. Maybe like within 100 days. It's just because it's what what this picked up. You can literally get a sense of where vol is cheap, which is clearly right here. And then you can get a clear sense of where vol is very elevated. And this is again, just a way to visualize volatility. Another tool that I told you guys I just started working a little more closely with Chris from Moon Tower. And I'm trying to actually help him a little bit with the tool. His tool is really cool, but I would be absolutely shocked if it doesn't have spy. Let's see. Yeah, I was going to say that just doesn't make sense. So his tool is again, giving you a different way to visualize that very same thing. This is just looking at the difference and changes in vol. So in this case, this is showing you a ratio between delta's and time. And then you can just look at how vol actually changed in terms of clicks, meaning like individual increments. Then you can visualize the term structure using this is using 50 delta options. And then it's just showing you the spread between. That expiration and whatever other expiration you're looking at. So in this case, we're looking at the 10 D's to",

And again, to give you an intuitive understanding. This is giving you 11.7. So let's just take a quick look together. Let's go to I have had eight concussions. So I already forgot the expiration's 10 D's and 15 D's. There's 15 there's 10. Let's go to something close to a 50 delta. That's going to give you like 10 point four. So we'll log that down. 10 point four percent. And then let's go out to the 15. Again, the 50 delta's in here. It's like 11.5. We'll call it. So now the question is well, what oh shit. The question is well, what is 11.7. That's literally just the difference between these as a percentage. It's giving you a sense of how different the skew is. So when we see this, we can immediately tell that the back is at a premium to the front, just standard. We would expect to see that.

So you can change like the look back period. This one actually really like this is probably one of the coolest parts of this by far, I think, is the realized versus risk premium. So anyways, this is another way you can visualize it and then another tool that does this is. O rats. I'll show you theirs. Here's what I'm doing. I'm just literally showing you all different ways that you can visualize wall, which is a really, really, really big part of what you do when you're trading options, whether you fully realize it or not. So in this case, you can plot it a couple different ways. I normally would just look inside the options chain for a little bit easier. So in this case, it's literally again just plotting the walls. And it's giving you the walls. This is a wall surface. It's just a slightly different format because we have our walls here. And then we have our dates as the x-axis.

But that's not the only way to trade and I include wall. Hevely as part of what I do, but it's not the only thing I do. The reason for that is you're never going to get astronomically good returns with wall and that's trading short wall long wall you have a better chance at. So in this context, I'm specifically revering to short wall, which is just trading different discrepancies across the term structure. We'll really, I should say across the surface. And a good example of what that can look like is if you paper trade this stuff for a while again, even if you just trade paper trade earnings for a quarter and get a sense of how those tend to behave.

You'll get a pretty good idea of what longer term performance might look like for you with short wall. And if I were to just take a like put a random number on it and again take this with a grain of salt, but it's likely generally accurate. I would say anywhere from like 18 to 35 ish percent per year. I think it's very reasonable for a short wall book. Now the downside to that is that you miss a lot of the upside years. Like I've already told you guys this year I'm on track for my third best year and my last. A are update that I shared with you guys the portfolio is up 78.9% 85 technically 78.85% on the year. Like that's not going to happen with short wall. You're just not going to get there. Part of that comes down to what do you like to do and how effective are you at doing whatever the specific thing is that you're doing. One of the most common misunderstandings with trading short wall is like just going out on the market, finding stuff with high implied volatility percentile and selling wall. That is not good.

That is not good. I'll repeat that that is not good. And I think that confuses a lot of tasty traders unfortunately. A lot of tasty traders are used to that approach. The reason why that's not a good approach is that a lot of times you're actually going to sell wall that's not price well. And you are taking asymmetric risk. You have to pay attention to that asymmetric risk. When you're selling wall, you have a defined profit. And if you're doing it in a peer sense, you have undefined risk. If you do it with defined risk, now you're really really diminishing how much money you can make in total by a lot, not even like a little by a lot, a whole lot. A good example of that is in like the zero DTE stuff that I do. And naked versus not it literally annualizes eight to 12% difference. It's massive. And that's because if you want to sell wall, but you also want to protect yourself, which, again, it's a logical thought. But who wouldn't do that?

Now let's tie these to tradable concepts. That's mostly what I'm interested with respect to the quiz. And then I want to talk a little bit about the rest of the topic for the day, which is like scanning for ideas, which, again, this is, well, the second part is part of that. This is fundamental knowledge that you have to know. You have to know this because if you're trading just about anything, you want to understand the risk that you're taking in how what you're trading behaves. Without that, you find yourself in this circumstance where you put something on and shit starts moving and you don't know why or you're confused. And it doesn't make sense. This is the very stereotypical, if you buy a call, the option goes in your direction and you lose money. That's, again, typically attributable to some combination of wall and theta. But that can confuse people because you can say to yourself, well, shit. It literally did the direction thing that I wanted it to do. Why did I get fucked up?

There's Vega, which is how sensitive our position is to evolve, but then there's also the term and how much the term, the term, the term, that's a form of change. A great example of that is here. If we take a look at how evolve has changed across these different terms, it looks very different. If we look at the 7-day Vault, for example, it went from 24 down to 9, and it did that over a few days. move 30 day ball went from 22 to 15 and 60 day ball went from 20 to 15.7. What this is telling you is you absolutely are finding yourself responding differently your position to how your ball is behaving.

But what I can guarantee you is that last statement that you're making is wrong which is reduced risk reduced significantly without giving up any profit that's not a scenario. What you might mean is that you're not giving up a lot of profit and unfortunately you're probably giving up more than you think. But there is no scenario where you're not going to give up any profit. If you're doing any sort of spread you are immediately giving up profit period and it's not just profit in the credit you receive which also confuses traders a lot. It's also through where you get your fills especially if you're not lagging in even if you are lagging in you're now transacting two times more and that's if you're only transacting on entries and then going to expiration.

In a nutshell, what I can tell you, this is going to be a factor is in terms of how much money you're making. That's pretty much it. Let's do, we can't do zero DTEs because they're none of them here. Black Mama says please explain the difference to an institutional trader, please. Yeah. Okay, Black Mama says just an example. Don't have the chain. Okay, that's super helpful. Thank you. Okay, so I think I'm following better now. What effectively I'm seeing is, I understand now. Well, you're taking way more risk. That's why if you put on one of the 6850, 6860, so a $10 wide spread, I mean, we could use the three days for this. This will be easy enough. And you said a 40 delta, you pick your, pick your delta.

If you do that other scenario at the 10 delta, so the 6805 to the 6875, you're risking $10, but you're making 60 cents. So now your risk is up to $9.40. That's for a one lot. Your scenario is saying, why wouldn't we do four of those to get the same amount of money? Now your total risk is $9.40 times four, compared to the total risk in this one, which is seven, seven in change. That's the difference. It's a completely different amount of risk that you're taking. Black Mama says agreed, but where comes the probability? You mean in terms of what? The, what we would expect is this one out here that's super far out of the money is to win a whole bunch. This is the very, very standard, super high win rate strategy, but you just need one losing trade and then you're wipe out how many wins, right? So let's just do the math on that. We said that you're risking, you're making 60 bucks, but you're risking 940. So what is it? 6.4 times. If you lose one, so you get rid of six, that's the reason. Now let's go back to a zero DTE in",

That ends up being the, the rub though. That's the, the drawback to it is that is the quintessential very high probability strategy, but if you're wrong a few times, you undo all the wins. And that's where timing becomes important, what that kind of stuff, if you have a good way, the sample volatility and whatnot. I wanna talk now a little bit about for the last few minutes. I wanna talk about the, actually, I think we should just stay on vault at this point, just because we're kind of fucking deep in here, boys. We've been on this ball stuff for a hot minute.

The, my instinct is that it would underperform. It would probably underperform pretty significantly. Let me take a look really quick. I have a couple, I literally have a couple tools running right now that I can ask it to do a super quick comparison for us. Let's do, first let's do like just 30 delta, short, and this will be in SPX from one day, these were launched until yesterday. There's some other small details, but it doesn't really matter for the comparison. So this is looking at just a 30 delta, short triangle. The compound annual growth rate from 2022, may 16th, which is when daily's were launched until now is, oops. Is 5.3%. And on these, let's add wings. Let's turn it into a vertical. So now I'm doing 30 delta, short wings. Or I'm sorry, 30 delta short for the base, buying 20 delta wings.

So you said a 10 delta and doing 10 strikes, 10 strikes, why? Let's start there before we scale anything. And let's see what this does to us. 0.6% compound annual growth rate with really bad drawdowns, really really bad drawdowns. The, yeah, the drawdown in this is much worse than the, there's on a relative basis. And when I say relative, it's relative to how much you're making. Your best year with this from start was in 2023 with a 0.83% return. So very little. Black mom says delta 10 40, 1.5% by 80 are wins. I ran a few tests this on Jesse AI.

And see if it logically makes sense. But what we know is as a base approach, it's gonna underperform meaningfully, very meaningfully. And we would expect it to, right? The reason why we would expect it to is because no matter what, if you have something that wins a lot, there's a cost to that thing. There's always gonna be a cost to that thing because you're gonna win a lot. That's the benefit. There is no, have your cake eat it too. If we think of, black mom says I agree that returns are not good enough to run it on Algo. Oh, I mean, it would probably net lose.

So yeah, I think with that kind of thing, the best approach you could do is see if maybe you can add some filters that logically makes sense to yourself, but you have to strike a really careful balance because you don't wanna get rid of too many samples. If you do that, then you're effectively dismantling the strategy. That's a really big part of trading any sort of more processed based, vol type strategies like that. Very delicate balance doable, but definitely delicate balance. Any other questions on that? That's a good conversation at least. Hopefully, I think the biggest thing for you there is paper trading at realistically and getting a sense of how it behaves. Mama says, a back test may be a fly. Yeah, yeah, and that's a good way to do it, right? Tinker with different setups and stuff. The reality is, if you move that far out, you're gonna really struggle to make any money.

And your returns at that point become really, really, really, really path dependent. Do you happen to get a good path? Or do you happen to get a bad path?

You can pick things that purposefully have more exposure based on ultimately what you're attempting to target. The piece I think that catches a lot of traders is specifically not aligning any sort of view of term volatility behavior against the term that they're trading. That I think is completely foregone and leads to a lot of people being upset because they don't know how much the term that they're trading is compared to what position they have. There's an easy way by the way to fix that. You don't even have to pay for fancy tools. One of the easiest ways to fix that is measure something like the previous moves. So if I look at the price performance or even better, the average true range average daily range any combination of any of these, specifically the true range day range would be better places to start. If I look in there and I ball how much something is moving, that'll give me an intuitive sense for volatility relative to time. And I'll give you an example of what this means.

And I'll give you an example of what this means. If I look across a five day period, the daily range is 0.6, true range would be better because volatility does care about overnight. For a five day period, true range is 0.7% if we go all the way out to 20 days, 20 days compared to five trading days, four times. Notice how the range is not four times. The difference, the variance in this duration. That's telling you a lot that's giving you a relative understanding of how volatile the five period is against the 20 period. Now again, this is historic. This is backwards looking. So you have to make a couple general assumptions like is volatility in S&P priced pretty close to fair. And the answer to that is yes. So then you can make an inference that implied vol would be priced a little heavier in the front relative than for the backterms, based on how much of these pieces. And the broader factor when you're trying to at least have an understanding of the vol and how the vol is behaving against the term that you're in is just so that you don't find yourself buying really expensive vols or unwinding stuff that you don't specifically want that risk to at that time.

You can isolate things pretty well if you want. Some ways you can isolate vol and isolate other stuff realistically. If you want to decrease what your overall vol risk is, is you can go further out in time and you can go further in or out of the money because if we plot Vega across the term, within a term, you'll see that vol will be pretty low when we'll use the out of the money stuff. It also depends on if there's put skewer, call skew. If we go out 195 days, you'll see vol is high when we're at the money, it's because there's the most extra in the value. Then if we go further out, we see vol tends to collapse. Sometimes it'll start to peak up pretty well at the tails, but the other thing to keep in mind is that the vol relative to the premium here is astronomically high.

The thing with this is that it is a really, really high probability, but let's just take a look at what this thing will look like in a few different scenarios. Let's say that S&P goes down to 400.

No, the skew itself doesn't really matter that much around actually placing a systematic based ball strategy, but the way that I trade earnings can be informed by the skew. There's a lot of information you can derive from skew. That part, it takes a little while to develop the intuitive understanding for it, but when you do, it's actually really, really useful in terms of finding some level of opportunity and stuff. The downside, the broader downside at least, is you really have to come up with or have to develop a pretty well-defined methodology for analyzing skew. Otherwise, you can find yourself like chasing ghosts pretty easily. What I mean by that is just being in stuff that doesn't work the way that you want, they're very, very easy.

That means the biggest market collapse is still probably ahead of us, but we just haven't seen it yet. There can be pretty profound moves in terms of a size over short durations.

You're not really fighting against much Greek risk because you're so far out of the money. You're not fighting against standard moves because you're so far out of the money. That risk in the tails is the risk that a tail trader is managing. And there's ways to manage the risk. But again, the crux there is that most people, when you trade for a while, you'll find that how much you're making for that risk isn't that attractive as a risk reward profile.

And unfortunately, they're trading like real money. And that's no good. The other thing is there were a series of very fortunate events that coupled with his disposition led to the outcome, which means that there's luck involved. And it's not an insignificant amount of luck. I've tried to quantify the luck aspect of my trading and it's very difficult, very, very difficult to actually isolate what I would attribute to luck, which is again, like what happens to happen.

Oston Anos says there's interesting studies about the overstatement of skill versus luck. Yeah, definitely. That, and it's important to acknowledge, I think, even when you're trading. And I mean, the reality is, most newer traders completely fucked that up, like bar none, they will absolutely over attribute stuff, which is just a really, really common behavior.
