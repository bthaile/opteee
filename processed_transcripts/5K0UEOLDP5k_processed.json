    "text": "let's talk about trading options in low volatility periods the reason why this is important is because we're kind of in one right now but also kind of not and I think a lot of Traders get hung up on this exact concept because if you build two unilateral of a skill set meaning maybe you just sell premium only it can be kind of difficult to Pivot and find good opportunities when the market conditions shift so we're going to talk about two things how to identify the type of volatility environment so that you know where to look for opportunities which is the second part and then at the end of the video I'm going to show you some of my personal scans that I use to help me find where opportunities are either for longv short Vol opportunities in low volatility markets what's up everybody Eric here welcome back to the outliers shout out to the patreon family let's talk about it so here we are pretty low volum volatility so what this is showing you is a frequency chart of vix closing prices in essentially on the left hand side over here and 5 increments and then on the right hand side we zoom in a little bit more which is kind of important and I'll explain to you why the reason being is right now if we take a look at where volatility is I'll grab a chart we'll go to vix and you'll see",
