    "text": "The next uncomfortable truth about trading is that if you are doing this for your enjoyment, just go to a casino. Literally, a casino is at least as more fun. You get to throw some dice. You get to see drunk people walk around. You might get to catch a show or something. There's at least true entertainment. Maybe they continue flooding the casinos with oxygen. You'll least get some oxygen out of it. The difference with trading is that the market will take your money. And if you come into the markets with the wrong expectations, if you come into the markets, looking for sensation seeking, which is actually a well documented output from a lot of traders that comes to their detriment unshockingly. If you're treating this anything other than a business, the probability is you're going to lose your fucking money. Don't do that. The way I look at it is I trade for business. It's how I earn a living. What I do with the money I make, that's for enjoyment. The ability to go travel to buy fun things that you enjoy to not worry about money. All of those things are the benefit trading is the work. Be an all-air sailater.",
