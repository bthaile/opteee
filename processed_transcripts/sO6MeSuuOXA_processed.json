So I want to talk about that. And then we're going to take a look at a little bit of GameStop, because we had an expiration today. And I will be stepping away from the daily videos for about a week. And then I'll be back online, getting right back after it towards the middle of August. So let's get into detail here. For those that don't know, I'm in the process of going through a rebrand. So you'll notice that the channel is no longer ES invests. It's outlier trading. I'm just trying to remove myself from the center of things, ESR, my initials. And I want it to be about the community. So this whole thing is grown in a completely different direction than I originally started the channel for, which was literally just sharing some information with my military friends. And I'm stoked to see it, but I want to make sure I'm moving with the way that our community is moving. So you'll notice I have a new website outlier trading dot IO. And pretty much everything else is going to be rebranded towards the outlier trading. So yeah, nothing really specific. But in case you need to get a hold of me, new email address, Eric at outlier trading dot IO, that kind of",

But in case you need to get a hold of me, new email address, Eric at outlier trading dot IO, that kind of thing. But anyways, let's talk about the markets. So we're seeing broad sell off across the board. And a lot of this in my opinion is stemming from continued general weakness across the market. And the funny part about this is I don't even view things as quite that weak. Like what I'm seeing right now, I'm not saying, oh, whoa, this is crazy. But what I am seeing is non-farm payrolls has absolutely cratered. We can see that unemployment is going up. We can see that essentially the rate that was expected was 4.1, came at 4.3. So this is just continued general broad weakness against what we saw yesterday, which was also a layer of weakness. And there's an interesting thing that you'll notice because of this. If we grab the Fed watch tool here and we compare the probabilities, we'll now notice that the probability of a 50 basis point decrease is now up to 75 for the 18th of September. Why is this happening? Well, it's because as we're getting economic data that indicates economic weakness, the expectation is that big daddy J pow will then be forced to do something a little more drastic, a",

Well, it's because as we're getting economic data that indicates economic weakness, the expectation is that big daddy J pow will then be forced to do something a little more drastic, a little faster. Because these kind of weaknesses are just showing cracks. But remember, these are all lagging indicators. So if it's not looking good now, even if we make a change right now, next month, it's not going to look good. The month after that, it's probably not going to look good. And you don't know exactly how bad it's going to get. So to me, that's also another reason why we're seeing the market behave this way. Because we've had one of the strongest first six months that we've ever seen. It was almost parabolic. The market was up the SP 500 was up almost 20 in six months. That's insane. So when we're seeing some of this weakness coming out, the market already, in my opinion, was at a point where it was very frothy. People were buying hand over fist. Things still were very uncertain, but we were kind of just following the information we had at the time. And now that we're starting to see some weakness, I think you're seeing the market react, essentially as it should. I don't even think that this is an overreaction.

If we take a look specifically at spy to start and all of a lot of people use spy people will hit me up when I use SPX and they'll say like, bro, nobody uses that point taken. So looking at the spy, you'll notice four days into the year we hit a low of 466. And then we essentially just went on a parabolic rally up until 522 in the beginning of April. Then we went from 522 ish down to a low of 493. So a very, very minor pullback and then back parabolic up to 565. So we're up almost 100 points on the year low to high. And then now we're down to 532 90. We're not even down 10. We haven't even entered a correction and people are losing their minds. And part of this is rightfully so we've been in a very straight upwards moving market. But if this recent move is causing you any sort of stress concern your portfolio is behaving in a way that you weren't expecting, take this as a shot across the bow that you have problems.

So if you were so well positioned because you got overly complacent because the market was showing you one thing, this is good for you. This is a really good time to reassess what you're doing and make sure that your approach makes sense. And always, always remember the market goes to directions the worst day is always ahead of us. We haven't seen it yet. So if you position way too bullish because things are just overall too good because you don't want to miss out. Yeah, well, get ready for the shitty part of that.

But the other reason is just because we're near highs. And that's very standard fair for me. But we need to keep an eye on where these things go. Now, something like NASDAQ has a slightly different experience. And I think it's because it's had an even more aggressive move. It's gone from 3.95 low up to 503. That's a massive, massive move for this product. And from there, it's selling off hard. I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that tech is at a critical point here. And it has been so, so, so overbought with people just speculating upside profit potential, just focusing on the good stuff as they should, typically, I think. But then when we have earnings and we have this broader market weakness starting to show, well, stuff that's high flying typically is going to get burnt a little bit more.

Stuff like that didn't necessarily wow anybody. And then today we had a reinforcing of things like this. Non-farm payrolls cratered. We saw unemployment rate going up from 4.104.3. So the market is at a point now where it's just so interested in how this thing plays out. And you have to remember there's leads and lags. So if we're starting to see this kind of weakness now, the overwhelming probability is that what we see next month is not going to be super great. And until there's some sort of functional change. So the market now is trying to price in what they think big daddy, Jay, I was going to do. And if we take a look at the Fed watch tool, you can see that the probability now of a 50 basis point cut in September is over 70. That's a massive change to what it was before. So if we compare that literally to just a day ago, that was a 22 probability. It's jumped up to 68.5 probability of this cut. Massive, massive change.

And the reason for that is because we're seeing this weakness. And the expectation then is that it's going to force daddy, Jay, how to do something about it. And part of it is now the market is getting a little skittish because we don't know exactly what he's going to do about it. And we don't know how long it's going to take or to what degree. So what that means for me when I look at the broad market now is just cautious with the risk. This isn't a time to freak out. Nothing's gone that terrible yet. It definitely has the potential. We're absolutely at a point now where the queues isn't a correction. It just dropped a little over 10 total from this high. So that bears respect. But take a look, the 200 day moving average is still positive sloping. We're coming in on this giant point of control. Again, that's not to say that I can't go lower. I wouldn't be surprised at all if it did. But this also isn't some crazy bearish configuration yet yet. It can be. It can become.

Although I will consider them and I'll be ready to adjust to them when they come up. So long story short, market, pullback definitely underway, broad across everything. And this is one of those things that if I take a peek through the various sectors, it is impacting just about everything. There are some slight, slight areas of strength still like XLU. And I go back to this perpetually with you guys. You can see exactly where I was eyeballing getting in. And the thing with stuff like this is there are typically pockets of strength even when there's broad weakness. And I'm showing you one right here. There's plenty of others right now. Believe it or not, you just have to look for them. So there's always opportunity whether you want to go long, whether you want to go short, whatever you want to do, there's stuff in the market that can accommodate those positions.

Shout out to my eight peeps. Game stop. Inside day. Very inside day. So it was good to see just, I mean, even minor semblance of a green candle, but I didn't like that it opened below this. We are still in this downward trend. It's continuing. Now, when I take a look at the volume today, I am a little happier to see more of a clean split. So there was 54 by volume against 46 sale volume. That's good. That means that we're starting to get into these levels that people are interested in transacting at. And I've talked to you guys about this quite a few times where I see those currently. We can see this volume node building out right here still. It's not all the way developed, but at 1968. So it looks like something around 20 bucks is interesting to people. And then after that, the next volume node is at like 1798. But what this tells me is that there's still people at least interested in transacting, but we are still negative sloping. Like there's you can't it's an objective reality is I look at this.

I am just trying to share the information as objectively as I see it. And then you can take with it whatever you will. I see something that's downward sloping from this peak high or this term high I like to call them on 17 July. So what does this mean? Well, we need to see where people are more and more interested in transacting. And right here, you can see some pockets of that, right? The fact that there was 54 by volume mean that there are buyers interested at these levels, which is kind of exactly what I was expecting. Somewhere right around in here. And I think when I look at the prospects for GameStop going forward, the other problem that it's facing right now is just small caps are getting hammered. Small caps are struggling. And I think that people have to keep that in mind as we're looking at their future and their future impact on something like GameStop. So when I look at something like GameStop's options, I see this.

The 20 September 22 puts there was 1600 of them bought at 345. 1600 might not seem like a giant trade, but it's not. That's a massive amount of money. So if I'm not mistaken, I think this trade is like over half a million dollars. It's like 552K. So somebody is trying to take GameStop to the downside via some long puts, which is really interesting to me because GameStop puts are still very expensive for what they are. So the fact that somebody's willing to pay up like that, I can't help but find curious. And I feel like the only reason why you put on a position that size with something that's already gone down quite as much as if you expect more. But I have to look at it as, I mean, how much more do you expect it to go maybe down again to like this 18 handle before you might look at managing that trade or something, but that's an interesting one that I'm going to keep an eye on. Now, as always, we got to pour one out for the homies because there's a ton of options that expired today. Worthless. Tons of them. Tens of thousands. God. Salute to the homies.

Salute to the homies. It's a Arnold Palmer, by the way, very good. So this again, not shocking at all, kind of standard fare for GameStop where this near-term expiration gets hammered pretty good. Now for total OI, I am seeing thankfully the call side expand, but so is the put side. So we have 723,000 calls to 390,000 puts. And you can see a lot of these puts are being put on. Get it further out in time. So we're seeing much more diversification in terms of the put expiration cycles as compared to the calls. The calls are very centered in 16 aug still. So it looks like next week, nine aug is quiet. It does not look like there's a whole lot going on for the options, chains, voles pretty low, 103.84. But we can see 16 aug voles already higher there, 109, definitely more active and much more positioned building going on in here. So this is I think where I'm keeping an eyeball on going forward.
