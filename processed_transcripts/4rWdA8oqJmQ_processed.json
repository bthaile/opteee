    "text": "We're gonna stack strength. We're not gonna focus on the outcome of individual trades to heavily. We're not gonna sit there and break all our rules to try to salvage an individual trade. We're gonna look for nose and we're gonna find opportunities that look so good that we can't say no. This is the perfect option to trade in my view. This is not talking about a trade that just automatically goes your direction and looks beautiful the whole time. It's not about whether or not the trade makes money. It's about following a process that we know yields positive expected return over time and continuing to do that, be an outlier.",
