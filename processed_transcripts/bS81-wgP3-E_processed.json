    "text": "What's up outliers trading week look ahead. We got a couple things I want to run through just calendar events what's happening take a quick look at the futures in general. And then I'm going to pop over and look at GameStop in depth to see any activity to keep an eye out for the coming week. So let's dive straight in. First thing here. Futures are open. They're moving around just a little bit. The eminies are up 0.18 the Russell and the NASDAQ up both. Originally about a quarter point now they're oscillating the Russell's at 0.2 NASDAQ little bit above that. The VIX is down essentially half a point Bitcoin unchanged gold up 0.58 in crude oil up a quarter point. So what do we see in so far. This looks like a little bit of a chilling out again. It's really important to understand that the futures open is not necessarily that indicative of what it will look like tomorrow during the actual open markets. But it gives us some ideas specifically if there are extremes but there's no extremes here. From a look across the different indices though there are some extremes we can see that the NASDAQ has been punished definitely more than the eminies the SP 500 and the Russell is just kind of doing its own thing it doesn't give a crap about what anybody else is doing. And it looks like it's actually wanting to open up even higher than where",

And it looks like it's actually wanting to open up even higher than where it closed on Friday. So small caps still showing strength. And yeah there is a big change here in the percentage of SP 500 stocks above their 50 day moving average. Now it's at 69.2. I like to keep an eyeball on this figure. It's kind of like a breath indicator for the SP 500 along with what I like to use for the market writ large. Is this here net highs and lows and you can see that for the NASDAQ interestingly enough even though it's getting punished to the downside we're actually seeing a collapse on gross lows on gross highs and net highs is expanding. And to correct what I just said the gross highs is expanding so we're seeing a collapse specifically in gross lows. So that kind of is interesting right because if you think about it the NASDAQ itself we can use QQQ is a bit of a more commonly used proxy it doesn't look to align with this right like I mean just take a look at it it's falling off a cliff yet as it's falling off a cliff it still has reasonable highs and so what's going on here well it",

But if we take a look at the NASDAQ you can see some of the bigger names in here if they don't perform well that entire index even though the majority of it might be hanging out doing its thing the rest of the index doesn't it doesn't really matter that much it's being pulled by the primary leaders there which is interesting. So I find that in and of itself somewhat curious now let's take a look specifically at calendar week ahead what events we have coming up and it's a little bit of a slower week so we essentially have nothing tomorrow other than some earnings so there's McDonald's earnings and then I think there's the Dallas Fed meeting business index nothing that I care too much about starting on the 30th though you'll see that we have the HPI composite I don't think that matters too much the house price index I care about just because I like keeping an",

In fact I think either of those are huge impacts Jolt's job openings will be a bigger deal and because just this unemployment anything related to employment right now is an important indication of overall economic health which obviously directly feeds into things like how the market is going to perceive the impact of inflation and the health of the economy. So 31st we have Chicago PMI which I do care about we have pending home sales crude oil inventories those kind of standard things and then the bell of the ball on the 31st we have the Fed interest rate decision and we have the press conference the rate statement then on the first we have manufacturing PMI by SP and ISM the balance sheet on the first unemployment stuff on the second now I want to take us back up to this specifically the rate statement and I want to take a look with you all at the Fed watch tool so that we can see right now what the market",

Now this is interesting because if we take a look at the overall probabilities we're running out of time for multiple cuts and previously there is actually a stacked cut here that's now gone because we're running out of time and what this is showing me is it's overwhelming probability of no cut in on the 31st then on the 18th of September this is down to 87.7 this was much higher. And this is also down quite a lot on 7 November to 63 so the market is guiding down this expectation of a cut pretty significantly but this still is showing a cut here in September here in November and a slight edge to a cut in December so let's three cuts in a row that the market is expecting to see so we will have to see how that goes TBD what I can tell you.

The other thing that I notice that is changed is the sixteen aug expiration cycle used to have higher wall than these and now it's actually lower that slightly interesting to me because even towards the end of last week I would have expected this to aug expiration cycle IV to pick up and it didn't. And now it's just starting to catch on which I find that again slightly topical because I really believe that the sixteen aug is going to be way more active. Then everything else we see here and again a lot of that just comes from a liquidity and a market mechanics perspective the weeklies are just not going to have as much going on in them and we can take a look at that.

But if we take a look at the sixteen aug positioning to start getting idea of what the market's looking at the one twenty five still off the chain lots of lots of. I don't even want to call it speculative transactions there it's just kind of a mix of things that I think going to this specific strike but there's forty thousand five hundred sixty two a lie there and then the rest of the distribution is kind of mixed so we do see the bigger. Strike right now looks like the thirties to me and then after that it'll be the forties and then after that it looks like essentially a tie almost between the twenty five's and the one hundred is very very close to one another and then after that the fifties and so on and so forth so this is where we're seeing some centralization now looking at this coming expiration cycle the one thing I want to",
