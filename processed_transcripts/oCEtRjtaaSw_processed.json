So I feel like that's just art and parcel for the game. Stop saga that there's always something going on. But I am stoked to do this with you, man. Thanks for spending the time to chat with us. Yeah. Thanks for having me on. I know it's a big deal to have a guest on your show. You never know what the person could say. So I appreciate you having me here and trusting me, especially with, you know, I know that you're new to the game stop saga relatively. Very. But you're really into options. And that's what you're crowds all about. So there's a natural kind of synergy going on here. So I'm as much here to learn from you as maybe you are from me. So excited to be here. Yeah, man. And well, it's funny because I think you give the platform a little too much credit. We are I'm pretty ratchet. So we can talk about whatever I don't care. So I figured to kick us off though, we could start really quick with a little bit of background on the way that you approach the GME space, specifically what got you into it and how you look at it now.

And the whole point for everybody is just so that you understand our perspectives where two people talking about a thing. What we talk about are ideas, opinions, none of this clearly is financial advice. None of us are financial advisors. We are all just dudes looking at information, trying to figure out what's going on. And I think one of the coolest parts about both of our backgrounds is they're very different. But there's something that's very clearly joined us, which is the anomaly that is GameStop. So I'd love to start with that a little bit about what got you into GameStop and how you look at it now. And that's a great intro. I kind of approach it from two angles. The first one is it's a puzzle. As you said, there's like an anomaly here that doesn't make sense. So that's my number one is trying to figure this thing out obviously to then make financial decisions for myself. Right. But I think you said it really well. None of this is meant to be financial advice for anyone. The volatility on GameStop, we've seen just in the last two months, GameStop's been as low as 10 and as high as 80. That's crazy for a stock.

The volatility on GameStop, we've seen just in the last two months, GameStop's been as low as 10 and as high as 80. That's crazy for a stock. And then there's bounce around to basically every price point in between there. So most people don't know what that feels like unless you've got shares or options or something writing on it. And then all of a sudden you're like, oh wow, this is a lot different when you've actually got money in the game. So the first angle is figuring out the puzzle and trying to use it to my own advantage. I would say, and then the second one is just telling the story because I feel like so often I hear things in the media or elsewhere. I'm like, that's just simply not true. And so I want to tell the story from my own kind of watching of it and see what's going on. And sort of that way when people come go back in time, like we've all done with I think Keith Hills live streams and various memes and everything else, you know, he told the story for a long, long time.

The GameStop community is huge, you know, at least 200,000 registered owners, probably a million plus people involved in this community. You know, some people are diehards. They don't want to ever sell a share until it goes to the moon. Other people trade options. There's such a big community. And I don't try to speak for anybody just speak for myself. Yeah. I think it makes a lot of sense. And I think the way that you highlight the the background of this story, it paints a pretty big picture at least in the way that you think about the the world that we're in and kind of the product that out.

They've been a huge part of my life. However, I'm specifically looking for market opportunities as they occur, where they occur. And that's what led me to GameStop during the original activity we saw back in the early 2020s. I think it was a 21. Right here January of 2021. Yep. And the way that I kind of came across this, my side was more so anomalous market activity. I have a bunch of scans and screeners that I run all day every day. And when I find things that peak my interest, I speculate. And that's really what I look to do is capitalize on markets that are moving and offer opportunities, sometimes asymmetric risk profiles, stuff like that. So as I'm covering and talking about my angle on GameStop, I think it's really important to mention. I very much view myself as a guest in this community. I do not have the background you guys do. I do not have an even tenth of the understanding of all the lore. I have people teaching me what these different memes mean. I'm learning a ton, but there's a lot.

So really the stuff I'm looking at is just from a kind of practical application of my trading skill set, which is centered in derivatives. That's what led to me, me into GameStop again during this most recent event. And I try to reiterate to people, I am not attempting to spread fud. I'm also not attempting to spread hype. I am a trader. I'm looking to find information that I can trade upon. So when I look at GameStop, there's kind of two very different sides of my brain that occur. The first part is from the technical perspective of trading. And then the second part is from this is the craziest story I've seen in a long time. And there's a genuine interest in the story. So it's a weird confluence of events for me because typically I'm very agnostic to product. I don't care what it is. I just want to know if there is an opportunity in there for me. And this is crossed those lines a little bit. So that's the primary angle that I'm looking at here just so that everybody understands where we're at. So I thought a good starting point would be if you could walk us through a little bit of the case for GameStop today as it sits today. Did you want me",

So I thought a good starting point would be if you could walk us through a little bit of the case for GameStop today as it sits today. Did you want me to tell really quickly my backstory on L. I got involved too? Yeah, please sorry because I kind of skipped that. So during late 2020, I regret not buying. But I was just kind of along for the memes. I was aware of Wall Street bets at the time on Reddit. I thought the memes were hilarious back then. So I was following along kind of keeping up with it. But I didn't understand what a short squeeze really was. I'll be honest. I didn't look into any of that. I went on what's what I call like an internet like detox. So throughout December, I was off the internet. I try to go only answer my emails at work. Otherwise, I don't allow any internet for a month. So when I came back, it was actually only because a friend had text me Elon's tweet saying GameStop, went on to Wall Street bets. I was like, oh my goodness, the story is still going. And then I like saw what a short squeeze was all about. I'm like, oh, this thing's going to go to the moon. So I'll buy some shares. So I bought some shares here on",

So now when you think about GameStop for you and the juxtaposition between making money as a trader and just the stuff that's interesting about GameStop, how have those two coalesced for you over your relationship I could say with GameStop? That's a really good question. So historically I grew up in the 80s and 90s and 2000s. So I remember GameStop as an electronic boutique. When this whole thing fired off I would say on Wall Street Betts. I didn't probably buy in because I'm a really risk-adversed person. So for me it was like this company looks shaky to me. So I got the Baratheasis right here. And I was pretty much sold on this Baratheasis. I'll be honest. I'll be, you know, we had a company at the time. This was four years ago that was losing revenue to downloadable games. They knew I used Steam. I used Epic. So I could see the problem here. I hadn't gone into an electronic boutique or a GameStop in over 10 years. Why would this company be doing well? Revenue per store is falling. They were closing stores. They had a lot of bad debt. Their leadership didn't seem to be doing anything about this problem. And there was no reason to choose GameStop over something like Amazon, Valve, Best Buy. There's no stickiness in this",

That seems pretty obvious. Ryan Cohen took over the company and missed that because I was on my hiatus. But in his letters to the board which I would later read, he says all the same things. You know that the company needs to transform itself. Still does. They needed to stop bleeding money quarter over quarter. So that would have been the that's the Barathees system in the nutshell right there. Right? So where do I like see GameStop now? Well, they were able to through the sneeze as we like to call it in January of 2021. Issues shares out and raise over 2 billion. So their debt problem is gone. They've got all this cash now to work with. They were able to trim costs substantially so that now they're yearly profitable. This took three years to do. Right?

I was like, when did I start reading 10 cues or 10 keys, right? And here I am pouring over to get every detail I can from them. And the company from a balance sheet perspective totally different now. Right? So the Barathees dollar for dollar makes no sense now. There still are these problems though. They're revenue for stores falling. They don't have a reason for for for people to be sticky customers right now. But they're starting to do things like what they've done now. It's very small. It's the beginnings. But like with the tradable collectible cards like I've got just picked up a new EV by the way I was hesitating on it if I should show it on the channel. But you know, they're selling PSS. They're upgraded. What's up? Why is she doing on show it? Oh, here we go. I was like, do people want to see an EV on the channel? But here we go. Right? So that's my wife's favorite Pokemon. Pokemon. I got to say Pokemon. I normally say Pokemon joking around with people. But I've realized that would have been a big misstep here. So anyways, back to EV. So yeah, it's our favorite Pokemon also.

And the company starts to branch out in ways it's never done. So I'm excited about that. And then there's also the whole aspect of you know, Ryan Cohen's on the board. He doesn't take any salary. He doesn't take any compensation at all. He just buys shares every year. You've got 18 of the company directly registered. That's never happened before as far as I know. You've got this legacy short interest that's got to be huge. Honestly. And then we've got Rory and Kitty, right? So we've got the best trader. I think we've ever seen. I think you can probably agree. Best options trader we've ever come across and now owns as far as we know, nine million shares of GameStop. I'm waiting for another yellow update. Right. So the bull thesis is looking pretty good to me. The company's just got to take this legacy portion of its business, right? Retail gaming, not the most glamorous thing in the universe and collectibles. And leverage that with the 4 billion in cash it's got. And it's unique fanbase to do something to make money.

What could they buy that's going to make the company money? That's number one. It needs to be small enough to not be a big risk. I don't want to see them burn a ton of cash and lose a ton of value.

So thank you for again, taking the time to at least teach me and obviously share with everybody else. It's super awesome. But let's talk a little bit more about that pivot. There are a lot of companies blockbuster, Kodak, right, that are examples of companies that were kind of premier leaders in a field, failed to make a pivot. And then they had a big problem on a business. So when you look at GameStop and you think about the pivot potential and what kind of pivot would make sense to questions. First one, timeline. What timeline makes sense for this two? What does it make sense to pivot into? Well, I hate to just always quote boring kitty, but he said it really well. It's been three years, right? If this takes more than three years, that's okay, but if it takes more than five years, that's not okay. So the timeline is, they need to start doing something here pretty soon.

I know people that followed my channel when it was very small, I was putting out NFTs every week. I don't know if you know that. So I was doing my own drawings, publishing NFTs using loop ring, and then giving those away to people. I thought NFTs made a ton of sense for two reasons. Number one, it was a way to take digital assets like in video games and make them collectible and then transferable between gaming ecosystems. So people could retain their value outside of say servers being shut down. So like, let's say you earned an item in Diablo Immortals, right? And then that server shuts down, and someone makes a private server where all those assets are still real, right? And you can still use them. And NFTs for items or NFTs for games are right up GameStop's alley because it's all about buying and reselling games. At the heart of it, that's been GameStop's kind of like MO or like identity for 20 years. So if GameStop became like the place to go for buying and reselling games that were in NFT form or in GameAsets that were in NFT form, that",

So if GameStop became like the place to go for buying and reselling games that were in NFT form or in GameAsets that were in NFT form, that would have been like the perfect way to take GameStop's existing legacy identity and make it modern, right? And capitalize on what was happening with NFTs. But NFTs went into like a bad period of time, you know? A lot of it became very speculative. The kind of market would jump from one chain to another to another. And it became honestly just like a rip off Conor's hub, which looked really bad. And the SEC came down with a lot of scrutiny on NFTs and crypto in general. And I think that the company kind of like took that whole idea, the NFT marketplace and everything associated with it and just put it on hold. They were like, it's not the right time. We could get ourselves in a lot of trouble going down this rabbit hole. And so they went to things that, you know, are very similar. Like this is very similar to me, right? This is something we all know and understand. It is on a blockchain because it's, you know, got a QR code and everything associated with it. But someone else holds the key to that, PSA does.

I know that in general, collectible cards are like an 11 billion history. How much can games stop pull in of that is yet to be seen. But right now, if you look at the volume of cards on the website, pretty small, not going to change the fundamentals of the company yet or something like this. So where do they, where do I see them going? But honestly, I've said on my channel, they probably want to go in a direction that no one would expect to give them some kind of, I don't know, survivability started to talk so long on this.

They could have another company under their umbrella that has nothing to do with gaming, nothing to do with the collectibles that just makes money. I would be happy with that too. IEP and Berkshire Hathaway are great examples. Very diverse holding companies. So it could games stop do something like that. They've basically done that in the past when they picked up all the mobile division companies. So they could do it again. And they built a lot of value there and then sold it off for cash. So I don't know, I'm not beholden to any idea. I know people are very focused on esports. I think that's very speculative right now. I think it's risky to go into something speculative. I'd like to see them honestly just wait because I think that macro conditions are ripe for a downturn and they could buy something for cheap. I don't know what it would be.

There's going to be paid in on the equity, right? So it's not just free cash. People paid into it and it's accounted for on the balance sheet. But what I'm looking at is a few things. I'm going to speculate a bit here, which I hate to do too much. But there was a merger and acquisition position. Was that? The tinfoil hat dog. I literally was going to make a tinfoil hat.

    "text": "the last couple months. Big signal. Larry Chang has been talking about various things to do with mergers or acquisitions or putting capital to use. Specifically, I want to say what he telegraph was you wouldn't dilute unless you had a reason to dilute, right? And also that dilutions can be seen as bad. But if they increase the long term health of the company, they can be good. And if the time is right, then you got to go for it. We also know that the lawsuit that Ryan Cohen, Cohen was brought into from the 2022 events was dropped or dismissed back here on June 11th. That's a big deal. So I don't know if that lawsuit was holding up a merger and acquisition or holding up the company from doing anything. But it's important that they're lawsuit free and the head of the company's lawsuit free going into anything that they could do. The other thing I would mention is the last time Ryan Cohen bought in was I believe right before the shareholders meeting last year in 2023, would have been right here. He had about 10 million with the GameStop in 2022. And then 10 million with the GameStop in 2023, he hasn't bought any GameStop since. And I think it's a hard ask for him to ask his shareholders, hey, I'm going to dilute us 39, which they just did. But then I'm not going to put my own money where my mouth is.",

So I imagine that the CEO is going to be in the know on any kind of merger acquisition that's going on with the company. Larry Chang and others might not be so let me that's why they were still able to buy. I don't think I have it on the chart still. But somewhere back here, I know Larry Chang bought in about 10 or 11. He added to the chart. But Ryan Cohen hasn't. And I know he's probably very much wants to. So something stopping him. He's probably on a lockout. And I would just say that's basically my gut feeling on merger acquisition news is that we're waiting for to be cleared through the powers that be right. So when could it happen?

And I think, I think people are really wondering how that actors into thing, especially as we get a little closer to transitioning into more understanding about your cycle theories. Well, I guess it's kind of a joint cycle. A lot of people that stop that. But let's start with the share offering. What do you make of it? Do you think that that negatively impacted the potential first sneeze if so? How and how does it feed into the FDD theory? Okay, so that's a big question. I think the first thing I would say is that neither of these two events we're going to cause more less. I need to start there right away. So more asked would be the mother of all short squeezes. We can see that the stock price on right here, May 14th in the pre-market hit 80 that morning. That was on a Tuesday morning. But it was on its way back down and they didn't offer shares until Friday the 17th. So the stock price was already running down. Right. And then Rory and Kitty",

    "text": "price on right here, May 14th in the pre-market hit 80 that morning. That was on a Tuesday morning. But it was on its way back down and they didn't offer shares until Friday the 17th. So the stock price was already running down. Right. And then Rory and Kitty came in and started supporting the offering by buying huge numbers of calls. Right. So two things to consider. They're number one. They didn't stop any kind of event. It had already happened. We don't know what it was necessarily. But it seems to be like a gamma squeeze of some sort. And then the stock was like pretty obviously back under their control. So I would have personally liked them to have issued shares sooner. Like maybe Tuesday morning, Wednesday morning. But instead they kind of let that whole cycle play out. And then they really offered into the tail end of it five days after big volume appeared. That's when they first start selling shares. And it was 50 million shares. They're 45 million shares. That's a lot. It's a pretty significant dilution. And they were able to raise 933 million. Which I would say is important because I wrote in the letters to the board, which I've got open right here. I really didn't want to see them use their cash file for merger and acquisition because you need, especially in this environment, high interest rate environment or the cost of borrow. It's still high for corporations.",

So if they are trying to do a merger acquisition or something like that, I wanted them to have cash on hand to do it, not use their existing cash file. So I'm positive on the whole event right here because they didn't disrupt a cycle. They waited for the cycle to kind of end their kind of telegraphing to the community. These cycles are happening. Right. If we can raise money into them, like instead of 10 at a low, like some companies do, dilute it a low. Let's dilute at a relative recent high. And they even set in the prospectus. You know, there's events here that are not corresponding with corporate action. So we're going to seize the opportunity and sell shares into it. So I'm sort of okay with this, especially because fails to deliver or still appearing post cycle. So you can see XRT still has fails to deliver after the cycle.

But I don't think if you're looking for a mother of all short squeezes, you're worried about 65 million shorts going down to 44 million shorts because you're pretty much convinced of this point that there's way more shorts out there than are being reported. So this is probably to me a drop in the bucket for the overall short interest. So then we get to the second dilution. I like their timing way better on this one. I'm going to make a lot of people really angry by saying this though. So let me walk through the second dilution. So we had an event happen on June 6th stock ran up to 67 in the after hours. And then they immediately offer in the pre-market into it. And they sell even more shares this time, 75 million shares at a much better price, 28 a share, raising 2.2 billion or so.

He didn't seem too concerned to me in that live stream. I'll be honest or any or surprised at all. And if you go back and look at his previous videos where they had offered an S3 in December of 2020, he was actually encouraging them to use the S3 raise money because he thought it could be really helpful for their transformation. And in this live stream, he basically says, look, you're either thinking that Ryan Cohen is a doofus or you think that there's something going on here and what does he do? Cells his calls a couple days later and buys a whole bunch of shares. So now this guy is riding a sandworm in his meme. And he's got nine million shares of GameStop, as far as we know, hopefully he's still got him. I don't doubt he does. That to me is just a huge signal of strength that a company can issue 50 million shares or 45 million shares. Issue another 75 million shares.

And the stock price has only gone up in that time period. That's great. So all this is great to me. Company has even more cash on hand. They diluted 39. I don't know. I'm very optimistic about this. And their biggest non-board member shareholder. What did he do during the whole time? When from 800,000 shares that we knew about up to nine million shares. So I don't know. It's all bullish to me. I'm curious what you think. Well, it's funny. The really the highlight of my perspective, you literally just said it. So I'll reiterate it though. The fact that especially in this most recent offering, when I saw that that was coming out, I was getting ready to closely monitor the price. And it's because I expected much more of a reaction that was. So the fact that when they made that offering, it was literally eaten up and the market really didn't care to me. That's supremely telling. And the other thing that I can't help but find so interesting is what is the intrinsic value right now for games? I was like 13 bucks a share or something like that. I think it's 1027. Okay, got it. And when I think about where that is juxtaposed to where price currently is, I can only imagine that the",

And when I think about where that is juxtaposed to where price currently is, I can only imagine that the people that really are trying to short game stop would love nothing more than to press it down here. And the fact that it's not happening, I can't help but find that fascinating. Especially when we look at the volume in GameStop over the last few weeks, it's been very, very on a relative basis, but GameStop has remained exceedingly, exceedingly range bound. It's hanging out. What it's hitting lows of like 2223 and then the peak starting from the 18th of June, the peak from there has been like 27 maybe. So it's been very, very, very, very range bound and light volume and it's not getting pressed down. That's very interesting. So when I hear people talking about the impact of the share offering, it has an impact. There's no debate about that. That's an objective. But I don't know that the impact is as detrimental as people think. Now let's dovetail that though into the FTD conversation because I do think that does have an impact there because a lot of people I think sometimes misunderstand market makers perspective and I'm not a market maker.

I'm actually really close friends with one that I asked him about this exact scenario and he did used to work at Susquejana. He runs his own little firm now and he's been trading. I literally think for 55 years and he's still market so the dude's been at this for a while and I was asking him how he would have treated specifically a position like Roy and Kitty's and it was fascinating because for a tenured market maker like that his perspective is as you have an option coming closer to expiration that's deeper in the money, you hedge it and you would be hedged leading into that event. We know GameStop and the market making firms for GameStop it also shocker is a bit of an anomaly and they do have a little bit of a history of under hedging in an attempt to make a little bit more money. I would have to view though the recent jump in price against the kind of landscape for GameStop with this tear offer would probably be well received by people that might be under hedged looking to gain exposure.

Yeah so I would say that if this is big F right if market makers are juggling fails to deliver and they're juggling ETF exposure they also deliver on ETFs then just just a quick offshoot there because I think a lot of people actually don't fully understand the juggling thing in the last time you were kind enough to like draw it out. Yeah let's draw yeah I think that would be super super fun. So basically here's here's kind of my theory in a nutshell so stock price is currently at like 24 right and what's going to happen is you're going to see a kind of ebb and flow towards Max Payne because as we know the market makers are going to want to end this thing near Max Payne so that calls don't get put in the money puts don't get put in the money and they could just scalp all the premiums week over week right.

So all these purchases where are they going to go right they're either going to fail game stop so let's put our game stop fails up here. So this is a beautiful drawing by the way so here's our game stop. Literally thinking if you do an NFT's these should be the freaking NFTs dude. Right so they have two places to juggle they can take these buy orders and they can fail game stop right which we see in this column right back here and I'd say what's really cool is post offering they were immediately failing game stop to a high degree again which is great to see right that was something I was very concerned about are these going to suddenly vanish because they're juggling got cleaned up with the offering I don't think so right where else do they juggle this well I think when they need more time they can then pivot these fails to deliver into ETFs right so down here we've got all these different ETFs I think there's something like 105 different ETFs that hold game stop right",

    "text": "that goes pretty deep into detail on it but it's important to note that market makers they actually don't have the leeway to just move price wherever they want to get it to Max Payne market makers are really slaved to order flow so I do believe that they have an incentive if price is close to Max Payne to try to drift it there but if price is like a wide margin away they can't just move price it's just important for people to be aware of how Max Payne kind of affects the marketplace because it's a thing to be aware of if it's close absolutely on the table if price something like this if it's trading for 15 20 dollars if it's like 5 away they can't move price 5 so just an important note I think maybe games stop people my disagree because we've just seen so many days where these cycles hit on a Thursday and by Friday sure enough here we are right in Max Payne again right yeah what's interesting is this cycle just a quick follow on to that though one of the things that you have to track is where Max Payne is so one of the reasons why you'll see that tendency is because people are trading their option into expiration they're trying to salvage what value they can out of their slightly out of the money option so that moves where Max Payne definitely in I try to like",
