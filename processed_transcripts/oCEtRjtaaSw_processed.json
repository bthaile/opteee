So I feel like that's just art and parcel for the game. Stop saga that there's always something going on. But I am stoked to do this with you, man. Thanks for spending the time to chat with us. Yeah. Thanks for having me on. I know it's a big deal to have a guest on your show. You never know what the person could say. So I appreciate you having me here and trusting me, especially with, you know, I know that you're new to the game stop saga relatively. Very. But you're really into options. And that's what you're crowds all about. So there's a natural kind of synergy going on here. So I'm as much here to learn from you as maybe you are from me. So excited to be here. Yeah, man. And well, it's funny because I think you give the platform a little too much credit. We are I'm pretty ratchet. So we can talk about whatever I don't care. So I figured to kick us off though, we could start really quick with a little bit of background on the way that you approach the GME space, specifically what got you into it and how you look at it now.

And the whole point for everybody is just so that you understand our perspectives where two people talking about a thing. What we talk about are ideas, opinions, none of this clearly is financial advice. None of us are financial advisors. We are all just dudes looking at information, trying to figure out what's going on. And I think one of the coolest parts about both of our backgrounds is they're very different. But there's something that's very clearly joined us, which is the anomaly that is GameStop. So I'd love to start with that a little bit about what got you into GameStop and how you look at it now. And that's a great intro. I kind of approach it from two angles. The first one is it's a puzzle. As you said, there's like an anomaly here that doesn't make sense. So that's my number one is trying to figure this thing out obviously to then make financial decisions for myself. Right. But I think you said it really well. None of this is meant to be financial advice for anyone. The volatility on GameStop, we've seen just in the last two months, GameStop's been as low as 10 and as high as 80. That's crazy for a stock.

The volatility on GameStop, we've seen just in the last two months, GameStop's been as low as 10 and as high as 80. That's crazy for a stock. And then there's bounce around to basically every price point in between there. So most people don't know what that feels like unless you've got shares or options or something writing on it. And then all of a sudden you're like, oh wow, this is a lot different when you've actually got money in the game. So the first angle is figuring out the puzzle and trying to use it to my own advantage. I would say, and then the second one is just telling the story because I feel like so often I hear things in the media or elsewhere. I'm like, that's just simply not true. And so I want to tell the story from my own kind of watching of it and see what's going on. And sort of that way when people come go back in time, like we've all done with I think Keith Hills live streams and various memes and everything else, you know, he told the story for a long, long time.

So, you know, I like to just think that in some way I'm following along with the story and telling it in my own way. But I do want to also say that I don't think I'd all represent the community. The GameStop community is huge, you know, at least 200,000 registered owners, probably a million plus people involved in this community. You know, some people are diehards. They don't want to ever sell a share until it goes to the moon. Other people trade options. There's such a big community. And I don't try to speak for anybody just speak for myself. Yeah.

They've been a huge part of my life. However, I'm specifically looking for market opportunities as they occur, where they occur. And that's what led me to GameStop during the original activity we saw back in the early 2020s. I think it was a 21. Right here January of 2021. Yep. And the way that I kind of came across this, my side was more so anomalous market activity. I have a bunch of scans and screeners that I run all day every day. And when I find things that peak my interest, I speculate. And that's really what I look to do is capitalize on markets that are moving and offer opportunities, sometimes asymmetric risk profiles, stuff like that. So as I'm covering and talking about my angle on GameStop, I think it's really important to mention. I very much view myself as a guest in this community. I do not have the background you guys do. I do not have an even tenth of the understanding of all the lore. I have people teaching me what these different memes mean. I'm learning a ton, but there's a lot.

That's what led to me, me into GameStop again during this most recent event. And I try to reiterate to people, I am not attempting to spread fud. I'm also not attempting to spread hype. I am a trader. I'm looking to find information that I can trade upon. So when I look at GameStop, there's kind of two very different sides of my brain that occur. The first part is from the technical perspective of trading. And then the second part is from this is the craziest story I've seen in a long time. And there's a genuine interest in the story. So it's a weird confluence of events for me because typically I'm very agnostic to product. I don't care what it is. I just want to know if there is an opportunity in there for me.

So throughout December, I was off the internet. I try to go only answer my emails at work. Otherwise, I don't allow any internet for a month.

That's a really good question. So historically I grew up in the 80s and 90s and 2000s. So I remember GameStop as an electronic boutique. When this whole thing fired off I would say on Wall Street Betts. I didn't probably buy in because I'm a really risk-adversed person. So for me it was like this company looks shaky to me. So I got the Baratheasis right here. And I was pretty much sold on this Baratheasis. I'll be honest. I'll be, you know, we had a company at the time. This was four years ago that was losing revenue to downloadable games. They knew I used Steam. I used Epic. So I could see the problem here. I hadn't gone into an electronic boutique or a GameStop in over 10 years. Why would this company be doing well? Revenue per store is falling. They were closing stores. They had a lot of bad debt.

But like with the tradable collectible cards like I've got just picked up a new EV by the way I was hesitating on if I should show it on the channel. But you know, they're saying PSC created what's up? Why is she not sure? Oh, here we go. I was like, do people want to see an EV on the channel? But here we go. Right? So that's my wife's favorite Pokemon Pokemon. I got to say Pokemon. I normally say Pokemon joking around with people. But I realized that would have been a big misstep here. So anyways, back to EV. So yeah, it's our favorite Pokemon also. So they're selling these PSA graded Pokemon cards. They're selling now these candy con controllers. So we're",

He doesn't take any compensation at all. He just buys shares every year. You've got 18 of the company directly registered. That's never happened before as far as I know. You've got this legacy short interest that's got to be huge, honestly. And then we've got Rory and Kitty, right? So we've got the best trader. I think we've ever seen. I think you can probably agree. Best options trader we've ever come across and now owns as far as we know, nine million shares of GameStop. I'm waiting for another yellow update. Right?

There are a lot of companies blockbuster, Kodak, right, that are examples of companies that were kind of premier leaders in a field, failed to make a pivot.

What timeline makes sense for this to what does it make sense to pivot into? Well, you know, I hate to just always quote boring kitty, but he said it really well. It's been three years, right? If this takes more than three years, that's okay. But if it takes more than five years, that's not okay. Right. So the timeline is they need to start doing something here pretty soon.

It is on a blockchain because it's got a QR code and everything associated with it. What someone else holds the key to that, PSA does. And it kind of prevents them from going into the whole crypto sphere but gets them into the collectible space. So I think that's a good way to go. But it's small potatoes right now to be honest. Like honestly PSA graded Pokemon cards is like I think like a multi billion dollar industry right now. I know that in general collectible cards are like an 11 billion history. How much can games stop pull in of that is yet to be seen. But right now if you look at the volume of cards on the website, pretty small. I'm not going to change the fundamentals of the company yet. Also something like this. So where do they, where do I see them going? But honestly, I've said on my channel they probably want to go in a direction that no one would expect to give them some kind of, I don't know, survivability started to talk so long on this is a good question. Survivability in the long term. And like so with the amount of money they have, 4 billion, they could just become a holding company. They could have another company under",

IEP and Berkshire Hathaway are great examples. Very diverse holding companies. So it could games stop do something like that. They've basically done that in the past when they picked up all the mobile division companies. So they could do it again. And they built a lot of value there and then sold it off for cash. So I don't know, I'm not beholden to any idea. I know people are very focused on esports. I think that's very speculative right now. I think it's risky to go into something speculative.

I'm going to speculate a bit here, which I hate to do too much. But there was a merger and acquisition position. What's that? The tinfoil hat dog. I literally was going to make a tinfoil hat.

But if they increase the long term health of the company, they can be good. And if the time is right, then you got to go for it. We also know that the lawsuit that Ryan Cohen was brought into from the 2022 events was dropped or dismissed back here on June 11th. That's a big deal. So I don't know if that lawsuit was holding up a merger and acquisition or holding up the company from doing anything. But it's important that you know, they're lawsuit free and the head of the company is lawsuit free going into anything that they could do. The other thing I would mention is, you know, the last time Ryan Cohen bought in was I believe right before the shareholders meeting last year in 2023 would have been right here. He had about 10 million dollars with the GamesStop in 2022. And then 10 million dollars with the GamesStop in 2023. He hasn't bought any GameStop since.

So he's been CEO now for almost a year. So I imagine that the CEO is going to be in the know on any kind of merger acquisition that's going on with the company. Larry Chang and others might not be so let me maybe that's why they were still able to buy. I don't think I have it on the chart still. But some were back here. I know Larry Chang bought in about 10 or 11 dollars. He added to the chart. But Ryan Cohen hasn't. And I know he's probably very much wants to. So something stopping him, he's probably on a lockout.

And that's the that's the great unknown for me, which makes this this is the the thing I lose sleep the most over is when this announcement happens, what's it going to do? Because I know when we talked, you would said generally speaking when a company purchases another company, the stock price goes down of the acquireer, right? So the buyer. So could it have a negative impact on games. If game top goes and purchases some other company, who would they be? How much are they going to contribute? How much is it going to cost us? How much are they going to contribute to the bottom line of the company? Those are all things I'm interested in. And then what's it going to do to the share price? Right?

And I think I think people are really wondering how that actors into thing, especially as we get a little closer to transitioning into more understanding about your cycle theories. Well, I guess it's kind of a joint cycle. A lot of people that stop that. But let's start with the share offering. What do you make of it? Do you think that that negatively impacted the potential first sneeze if so, how and how does it feed into the FDD theory? Okay, so that's a big question.

Right, and then Rory and Kitty came in and started supporting the offering by buying huge numbers of calls. Right, so two things to consider there. Number one, they didn't stop any kind of an event. It had already happened. We don't know what it was necessarily, but it seems to be like a gamma squeeze of some sort. And then the stock was like pretty obviously back under their control. So I would have personally liked them to have issued shares sooner, like maybe Tuesday morning, Wednesday morning, but instead they kind of let that whole cycle play out.

So reported short interest goes down, which you know, if you're looking for a mother of all short squeezes, that's a concern. But I don't think if you're looking for a mother of all short squeezes, you're worried about 65 million shorts going down to 44 million shorts because you're pretty much convinced at this point that there's way more shorts out there than are being reported. So this is probably to me a drop in the bucket for the overall short interest. So then we get to the second dilution. I like their timing way better on this one. I'm going to make a lot of people really angry by saying this though. So let me walk through the second dilution. So we had an event happen on June 6th stock ran up to 67 in the after hours.

And they sell even more shares this time, 75 million shares at a much better price, 28 a share, raising to 0.2 billion or so. So much closer to the peak, like basically almost right into the peak. I like this timing. This is basically what they did on June 8th, three years ago. So I'm going to go back in time a little bit right here. So June 8th is right here. So they had a shareholders meeting. Stock is running up to 350. They offer right into the top of it. Netting themselves incredible money right here, putting in place all the cash we had on hand to do basically stage one cleaning up the company, getting it healthy again, and having money on the balance sheet. So they would not have posted a profit this past year. Had they not done this? So this was basically a year or three years ago to the day. So I like this. I also recommended it to the board in the letter. So I specifically said, have shares on hand with which to offer into one of these cyclical events. Because again, I don't think this was Moas popping off or any kind of squeeze. I think it's just a fail to deliver cycle. So we can kind of maybe pivot into that at this point.

And this guy, at the time, was worth what? 900 million on his position. He didn't seem too concerned to me in that live stream. I'll be honest or any or surprised at all. And if you go back and look at his previous videos where they had offered an S3 in December of 2020, he was actually encouraging them to use the S3 raise money because he thought it could be really helpful for their transformation. And in this live stream, he basically says, look, you're either thinking that Ryan Cohen is a doofus or you think that there's something going on here. And what does he do? Cells his calls a couple of days later and buys a whole bunch of shares. So now this guy is riding a sandworm in his meme. And he's got nine million shares of GameStop, you know, as far as we know. Hopefully he's still got him. I don't doubt he does. You know, that to me is just a huge signal of strength that a company can issue 50 million shares or 45",

I'm very optimistic about this. And their biggest non-bord member shareholder. What did he do during the whole time? When from 800,000 shares that we knew about up to nine million shares. So I don't know. It's all bullish to me. But I'm curious what you think. Well, it's funny. The really the highlight of my perspective, you literally just said it. So I'll reiterate it though. The fact that especially in this most recent offering, when I saw that that was coming out, I was getting ready to closely monitor the price. And it's because I expected much more of a reaction that was. So the fact that when they made that offering, it was literally eaten up and the market really didn't care to me.

And when I think about where that is juxtaposed to where price currently is, I can only imagine that the people that really are trying to short game stop would love nothing more than to press it down here. And the fact that it's not happening, I can't help but find that fascinating. Especially when we look at the volume in GameStop over the last few weeks, it's been very, very light on a relative basis, but GameStop has remained exceedingly exceedingly range bound. It's hanging out. What it's hitting lows of like 2223 and then the peak starting from 18th of June, the peak from there has been like 27 maybe. So it's been very, very, yeah, very, very range bound and light volume and it's not getting pressed down. That's very interesting. So when I hear people talking about the impact of the share offering, it has an impact. There is no debate about that. That's an objective.

Now let's dovetail that though into the FTD conversation because I do think that does have an impact there because a lot of people I think sometimes misunderstand market makers perspective and I'm not a market maker. I'm actually really close friends with one that I asked him about this exact scenario and he did used to work at Susquejana. He runs his own little firm now and he's been trading. I literally think for 55 years and he's still market-making. The dude's been at this for a while and I was asking him how he would have treated specifically a position like Roryne Kiddies and it was fascinating because for a tenured market maker like that, his perspective is as you have an option coming closer to expiration that's deeper in the money, you hedge it and you would be hedged leading into that event. We know GameStop and the market-making firms for GameStop, it also shocker is a bit of an anomaly and they do have a little bit of a history of under hedging in an attempt to make a little bit more money. I would have to view though the recent jump in price against the kind of landscape for GameStop with this fair offer would probably be well received",

I would have to view though the recent jump in price against the kind of landscape for GameStop with this fair offer would probably be well received by people that might be under hedged looking to gain exposure. The tricky part for them though is they weren't really getting in at a great price because price did not plummet but how does that impact your cycle kind of theory? Yeah so I would say that if this is big F, right, if market makers are juggling fails to deliver and they're juggling ETF exposure, they're supposed to deliver us on ETFs. Just a quick offshoot there because I think a lot of people actually don't fully understand the juggling thing in the last time you were kind enough to draw it out. Yeah, I think that would be super kind. So basically here's kind of my theory in a nutshell. So stock price is currently at like 24, and what's going to happen is you're going to see a kind of ebb and flow towards Max Payne because as we know the market makers are going to want to end this thing near Max Payne.

Which we see in this column right back here. And I'd say what's really cool is post offering. They were immediately failing GameStop to a high degree again, which is great to see, right? That was something I was very concerned about. Are these going to suddenly vanish because they're juggling, got cleaned up with the offering. I don't think so. Right. Where else do they juggle this?

I think there's something like 105 different ETFs that hold GameStop, right? So what they can do is they can go to a market maker and then can say, Hey, make us a unit of XRT, which is like 40,000 shares of XRT. And why would they do that? Right. Well, upon the creation of this unit of XRT, this batch of XRT, they're just not going to put any GameStop in it. They'll put everything else in it, chewy and all the other companies that are in it. But they'll pivot some of these fails to deliver from over here to over here. It's a juggling act. So what would be the signal that they're moving FTDs from one hand to another, you would see volume here. You would see the creation of ETFs, and we see that repeatedly in this column here.

I think XRT is already, sorry, I think XRT is already full. And someone asked a really good question today on my channel. They said, what do you mean when I say that XRT is full? I mean, it's all failed out. So XRT, we know has, let me pull it up here, 230,000 shares of GameStop that's represented in its outstanding. So the most they can fail is 230K shares of GameStop. But that would be for the five million shares of XRT that exist. The thing is about ETFs is you can short them to create additional like phantom units, right? And XRT specifically is shorted 400 and something percent. So that basically means you have to take this whole thing and multiply it by four or five. So you're going to have something like 20 million shares or 25 million shares of XRT. So basically they can fail XRT to about 1 million shares of GME. And then it's done. They cannot fail XRT any longer. It's full up. And what is it full of? It's full of cash because they're cash settling this ETF in hopes of someday down the road, turning all that cash back into GameStop. But they don't want",

Well, they could pass it back over and fail GameStop a whole bunch. We've seen that happen in the past. Or they could go to the market and buy GameStop. But if they do that, what's going to happen to the price, it's going to go up really, really high, right? So this is where we see events like 6, 6. I believe 6, 6 was them settling ETFs, especially XRT, getting shares back in there to basically clean it up. So it can be their liquidity engine again. And they can use it to drive price down. So June would have been one of those events. And then when would the next one be, right? Is the big question, I think everyone would want to know, when is the next time they need to fix XRT? Got it.

Yeah, it's pouring. I actually thought that we were going to get a bit more creative drawing, but okay, fine. All right. So way number one, you can short the stock as you could just go to the Lent pool. They never want to go to the Lent pool, right? It's reportable. They're paying, you know, a short percent. Every single day, they don't want to do that. So they could buy puts, right? When they buy a put, a market maker is going to come in and hedge it. What's the market maker going to do to hedge the put? Short sell the stock, right? Probably naked. So they could drive this stock down that way. And it inflates the off-standing because the market maker is naked shorting to hedge their position or they could fail to deliver an ETF, right? Which is what I just described right here. This basically gives them not infinite liquidity, but near infinite. Just like we saw. Go ahead. Just a quick note on the hedging puts. The way",

This basically gives them not infinite liquidity, but near infinite. Just like we saw. Go ahead. Just a quick note on the hedging puts. The way that you're talking about hedging that is what we would call like a bit of a peer hedge. There's a lot of other ways that they can hedge that position now. And I think it's important just to flag that. Again, it doesn't impact this too much. I just see a lot of people apply the very strict approach of hedging with pure hedges. And the reason why I bring that up is because it oversimplifies a little bit about the way that market makers are going to manage their book. And it's never predicated on one single position. It's always predicated on the entire book of positions across all products. So just a worthwhile note, nothing incorrect at all, but just something other people should be aware of. Perfect. And then I'll say the last one, the one we know the least about is right swaps. So what is a swap? A swap is a derivative contract between a party and a counter party. If it's an equity total return swap and it's to the downside, you're betting that the stock is going to go down. So you could get huge exposure to GameStop to the downside. What's the",

So just for you to be aware of, just think of it as a contract between two people with specific terms. Perfect. So here's GameStop's graph. And what I'm going to show is these peaks that we were seeing back in 2021. Most of these high points back here were probably ETF related cycles happening. But we haven't seen very many of them since we saw one back here. We saw one here. And then this was the last one we really saw. This was in June of 2023. It was it was like a small one. If it was even even a cycle, then we saw nothing since. And I think the reason why we didn't see anything since is because we know that a lot of swaps containing GameStop were entered back here in August to 2022. The only cycles after these swaps were entered was the one I mentioned on Halloween of 2022. Potentially like a small one in February of 2023.

We had some fails that looked pretty distinctive. So how are they controlling this? I think they were controlling this with long duration swaps. And we know that all the swaps, all their expiry for all those different swaps that were in it was at the end of May of this year. So the timing is just too perfect. So we know that there's just a couple of ways you can short. We've got the one with the most visibility. But it's also a pretty good visibility. ETFs don't have a lot of visibility, but the cycles seem pretty distinctive. And swaps are a long duration and huge. Talking about tens of millions of shares. But we do know that they were expiring at the end of May and beginning of June. And that's when everything started happening again on GameStop. So to me, it's a question of where did all the cycles go? They were able to just say, okay, our ETFs are full. We don't want this thing to blow up again. Had these cycles appear again.

And you can or I'll actually mention one other thing I wanted to make sure I mentioned. They basically need to find sellers. Right. So a swap to me just represents a big bunch of sellers. When they enter them right back here in August of 2022, the stock got crushed down because their counter party is going to sell. They're going to sell shares. In this case that they don't own, right? They're naked short on the to hedge the swap. Right. So the stock goes down because of all the selling pressure. When they re-entered swaps somewhere around in here, what happens? Stock goes down even more. Right. So entering swaps is one way to cause suppression of cycles, suppression of price. But another way is institutional ownership went down. So we can see GameStop institutional ownership used to be like 99. But then institutions sold off throughout 2021. So back in here. So every time institutions sold out, especially post November, the stock I hit hard because retail doesn't have that kind of buying capacity. I know retail did buy like 75 million shares in DRS and all and probably owns like 300 million shares overall. But it takes a long time for retail to buy. If an institution just goes out and dumps 10 million shares, that's very hard for retail to go and undo.",

And that's why you see the steady like creep back up, I think. But I think that what we saw was big institutional selling. But to me, a big bullish thing is that institutions are now basically done. Like they've unloaded all their bags. If institutions want to get back in on GameStop, they've got a long way to go. So this is like a contested space at this point. An institutional ownership is that a low. I see. Let's pivot a little bit more now to the to the cycles. We see a couple really big tendencies in terms of seasonality. You're walking me through that in your track or quite a bit. Now this month tends to be quiet next month, ends to have some kind of activity. What are your expectations around that?

It's always at the beginning of a month. And there's a reason for that. You can see that the price blips up here. This is a relative high on price, 25. You know, decent volume. Everyone will remember these like there's key days in the game stop histories like in the lore, right? When these happen, prices going bonkers just like on June 6th and then crashes right off the top and gets shorted down into oblivion. So what happened here? I believe if you look back, you're probably looking at, yeah, or signals right there. So this is February. So what you want to do is you want to go back to not the previous opX, but the one ripe up for it. So we're looking at December's opX. And what we're looking for is a signal here.

So what's happened here is what I believe happens is this is a monthly options X-Pri, especially yearly like this. This is December, right? So lots of activity. There's going to be lots of puts and calls going on here. They don't want to go and get game stop shares, although it looks like they had to to satisfy this. And they failed a bunch of them. What they do is they go to ETFs and fail the ETFs instead. So that's what I described on the picture here. So during a monthly options X-Pri, a period like this, lots of demand for game stop.

So if you just go out 34 trading days, it's usually 33 or 34 like right on the nose. And that's where the cycle happens. In theory, why does this work? Hopefully people follow along with me here. I think that it's because it's not one market participant that's happened here. It's two market participants. What happens is they request the creation of the share of the ETF. Now that ETF authorized participant, that's the person that makes the ETFs, the units has 35 calendar base. So that's going to take us out to five weeks from here, which is going to be, so this would be actual calendar base. And you would go out to about right here.

The one that roaring kiddie seemed to anticipate and kicked off everything we've just seen. So what we can see is huge fails to deliver over the last year on XRT and all the other ETFs and games stop importantly. So they were suppressing the stock as hard as they possibly could, got it down all the way to 10 bucks. You can see that the fails are going crazy on XRT at this point. They're not even following a pattern. They're just happening all over the place. But where you would expect one of these like reconstitution of ETF cycles to occurs right here on May 3rd because that's from options X free and March 34 trading days later exactly.

    "text": "But where you would expect one of these like reconstitution of ETF cycles to occurs right here on May 3rd because that's from options X free and March 34 trading days later exactly. So we go out 34 trading days. And again, I know it shouldn't work like this, but it seems to. And all of a sudden you see huge volume out of nowhere. And the price goes up like crazy. This is a classic May cycle. What did roaring kiddie do? He bought calls as we all know right in this cycle millions of dollars with the calls. And they were so cheap right there. It's crazy because we're incredibly cheap to buy. So that caused a gamma induced event leading all the way up to 80 a week and a half later. All right, so that's like a lot. That's a lot to process. I think anyone new to the story is going to be like what just happened here, but it's crazy because you can go back years and years and years. And you can find these cycles like here's one. Now quick note on that though. What do you think about the instances where the cycle doesn't happen? That's a good question. So yeah, so right here, classic case, big volume, big price improvement cycles clearly coming off of this opx where we see used fails to deliver perfect case, right? And this is just some random month in 2014. But it won't happen, right?",

So what is the actual? Yeah, like we should probably look at the most recent one. So look at May 3rd. That's a good question. What you might see sometimes is something like, sorry, scrolling all over the place here. So see how the day before somebody is epilepsy. See how the day before on May 2nd, there was actually like a blip up in volume. That could have been because he was buying all these calls, right? But so maybe there's options related to activity leading up to it, but it's typically a corrupt just boom. We're all used to this huge volume pours in on a nowhere.

But it's characteristic of being in the first part of the month. OpEx is the third Friday of the month, right? So this is early in the month and is somehow related to the events from the past.

One of the next things I think we have to hit quickly at least is XRT. And specifically, what do you think about XRT's involvement? You talked about the ETFs a bit already. But there was a couple questions specifically about XRT. So is there anything special there as far as you see it? Yeah, I think XRT has been a big part of the story since really the beginning. As far as my data goes back here, you can see that during options related settlement on GameStop, XRT was hit up every single time. Like here's an off-excelment period. This is July of 12 years ago. The volume on XRT is crazy and the fails to deliver on XRT correspondingly crazy. They've been using XRT as a source for a locate for shares for GameStop for decades. For a very, very long time.

There's only three that don't have near 100 institutional ownership. So let me pull that up really quick. Should be the top of SuperStunk. Hopefully it's up here. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to find it right away. I know it's going to be right below where I stopped scrolling. But basically, it's always that goes, right? Yeah. So it's interesting that of all these stocks held in this very, very overshorted ETF, right? Institutions own like 100 of almost all those ones in that basket. And GameStop used to be owned 100 99 by institutions because it was so overshorted, right? So it's telling",

And GameStop used to be owned 100 99 by institutions because it was so overshorted, right? So it's telling me that all the stocks in XRT are very overshorted. That's the only way that institutions creep up to 100 ownership, right? Because every time they lend their shares, then they buy the back of same shares, and they keep increasing their holdings as the share price plummets, right? So this basket of stocks, XRT, is unique because number one, it's been moving between like 400 short and 1,000 short over all the time we've been watching it. All the underlying are probably grossly shorted if they have 100 institutional ownership, except for basically three companies. GameStop, Chewy, and this recent company that just got added to it, I'm not sure even on the name. So somehow, roaring kiddies targeting the two companies in it that aren't like institutionally owned 100 and why is he doing that? So it's just a huge curiosity. But the only times that we've seen XRT volume, like we saw in the recent last six weeks, like we saw 30 million, keep in mind, there's only supposed to be 5 million shares outstanding of XRT, but we're seeing 30 million volume on it right here, right?

Like I'm not sure what this was specifically, but I've got a bunch of other ETFs tracking back here. So it could be VTI, which you're probably familiar with or VT or IWB. But at some point they juggle away from GameStop because their fails are getting too bad on GameStop, away from XRT because their fails are getting too bad on XRT and they go to another ETF. And so you see the signal move to another ETF. But this seems to be the ETF of like favor for them. And I'm not sure why that would be maybe state street. Just doesn't regulate it as tightly as the other ones or maybe the LENFee is more reasonable there. But it seems to be the one they always go to the most.

So basically, if we look at what happened recently, we saw on 5.3, this would have been an ETF-related settlement event. Right? Again, I didn't discover these or anything like this. It would have been off March, so three, 17 or whatever, what are what are what it was? It's to this event here. We saw the price run up, but the ETF-Fee anticipated it, bought calls into it. And basically, rather than the stock price crashing back down to 10, like we would have expected it to, it got caught in gamma and then ran off to 100 or 80 up something like that. Right? So there was a share offering into the tail end of it right here. So a question that you had earlier was, am I concerned about the share offerings? Not really, because if the share offering would have like killed cycles, then 6.6 wouldn't have happened, but it happened anyway. Right?

Right? So the company offers. Just a quick note on that, because you mentioned that before, Tuna, and I just want to clarify a little bit about Max Payne. I have a video that goes pretty deep into detail on it, but it's important to note that market makers, they actually don't have the leeway to just move price wherever they want to get it to Max Payne. Market makers are really slaved to order flow. So I do believe that they have an incentive if price is close to Max Payne to try to drift it there, but if price is like a wide margin away, they can't just move price. It's just important for people to be aware of how Max Payne kind of affects the marketplace, because it's a thing to be aware of.",

    "text": "is close to Max Payne to try to drift it there, but if price is like a wide margin away, they can't just move price. It's just important for people to be aware of how Max Payne kind of affects the marketplace, because it's a thing to be aware of. If it's close, absolutely on the table, if price, something like this, if it's trading for 15, 20, if it's like 5 away, they can't move price 5. So just an important note. I think maybe games, not people might disagree, because we've just seen so many days where these cycles hit on a Thursday and by Friday, sure enough, here we are right in Max Payne again. Right? What's interesting is this cycle. Just a quick follow on to that, though. One of the things that you have to track is where Max Payne is. So one of the reasons why you'll see that tendency is because people are trading their option into expiration. They're trying to salvage what value they can out of their slightly out of the money option. So that moves where Max Payne. Definitely. I try to like on the sheet, you'll notice like I put Max Payne over here. And when I start to see it move a bunch, I'm like, okay, the flow is pretty interesting, because the flow is going to move the Max Payne around a bunch, right? Yeah, that's totally true. So maybe something to mention before we get into",

Yeah, that's totally true. So maybe something to mention before we get into the futures, looking again at the past, the cycle is rarely end on a Friday because of the nature of the options X-Brief is going to be on a Friday. And if you go T plus 6, T plus 35, T plus 1 or 2 or whatever, it almost never ends on a Friday again, but it did in this May cycle. So very, very important. This May cycle for one of the first times in a long time, May 3rd right here was Friday. So price ran up all the way up to 1745. They were only able to get it down a dollar by end of day. So that caused, you know, it ended way over Max Payne for the first time in a long, long time. And you can see what happened. Like the impact of that was just incredible. So we can see why they don't want it to go too far above or below Max Payne, because apparently in the weaker two to follow, it's just going to cause a reckoning. So that's what we saw on May 3rd. Reckoning happened, went up to 80. Company issues. We still get a cycle off of ETFs.",

Reckoning happened, went up to 80. Company issues. We still get a cycle off of ETFs. I think there's some kind of deferral because of June 10th. So June 10th to 619. And then 4th of July is another holiday. Both of these holidays landed in the middle of the week this year, not on a Monday or a Friday. And I think for some reason, when the holidays land in the middle of the week, it means that they don't have a reconstitution event. So we're not going to see, I don't think, a tailwind on 7.9 like we should. So there should be a cycle here on 7.9. But instead, it's going to skip because the holiday basically pushes it to the next one, which is going to be 80. So that's my, my current theory is, you know, was able to predict this one with pretty, pretty strong confidence because I had looked at the chart. We'd had 66 of June's hit. July almost never hits. Whereas August is pretty consistent. I love it. And I am at my hard stop. So I have to drop and that will wrap us up.
