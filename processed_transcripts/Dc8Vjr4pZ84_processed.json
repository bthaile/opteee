And to kick us off, I want to share a video from one of the very best Ronnie Coleman. I don't want to be a body new. So nobody will have to hit it and wait. Go. I do it. Go. The big squat. If you couldn't hear him super clearly, because it's an old video, he says, everybody wants to be a bodybuilder. Don't nobody want to lift his heavy ass weight. I'll do it, though. That is the exact mindset. You are going to have to adopt in order to be successful at trading because literally everybody loves the idea of being a successful trader, being able to control your time is nice, being able to fly first class everywhere you go is really nice. Having fun things to do on the weekends because you have resources to do them, and you don't have to put your head down and save all the time, being able to travel. All those things are really nice. We love that part of it, but very few people embrace the work that has to come first. So let's talk about this. Now, the thing I want you to keep in mind is we go through literally this entire video is that normal thinking doesn't work in trading. Normal thinking works terribly. What's an",

Now, the thing I want you to keep in mind is we go through literally this entire video is that normal thinking doesn't work in trading. Normal thinking works terribly. What's an example of that? Very simple. Bargain buying. You're taught that if you go to the store, you should look for things on sale because you're getting it cheaper than otherwise it would be. Well, in trading, that kind of mindset will lead you to buy things that are cheap because they're cheap, but in markets, there is very often a reason why things are cheap, and they tend to get cheaper. Inversely, some of the best possible trades to get into directionally speaking are trades that are going high in making higher highs. That's really tricky because you're buying something that seems to be at a high nominal level. But again, there's a reason why it's high. And a lot of times those things tend to go higher. Now, obviously, there's new wants to this. That's just a very simple example to prime your brain on why normal thinking does not work in trading. You have to embrace that concept. So let's talk about why a bunch of traders fail. There's different numbers that you'll see thrown around, but the overwhelming majority of traders do fail that start.

There's different numbers that you'll see thrown around, but the overwhelming majority of traders do fail that start. So if you pop over to my website, I actually have a little table here that goes through some of the statistics and then some different studies that talks about the profitability of traders. I don't like throwing out numbers that you'll hear all the time, 90 of traders fail without giving you something to actually look at because most people are kind of lazy, that'll actually be a theme of this and they'll just repeat stuff that they've heard without actually looking it up. But it's actually a little over 90 will fail. So why do they fail? Well, I just hit one of the points for you directly. Lazy, lots of people that start trading are lazy. They again, like the idea of the output, they don't like the idea of the input. So they're going to try and apply a really subpar approach to start the process of trading and then shocker. They're going to get subpar results. There's no big surprise here. If you look at the people that are successful in pretty much anything, they are not lazy. You cannot be lazy. You have to put in work. That's actually one of the trickiest parts because there's a lot of people that have a lot of talent.",

That's actually one of the trickiest parts because there's a lot of people that have a lot of talent. But if you have a lot of talent, but you're lazy, the talent goes to waste in trading, can't be lazy. There's no shortcuts here and you have to embrace that early on. Lack of rigor, this is a really tricky one. And a lot of times in our mind, we're working harder than we actually are. And that's really difficult. And there's another component where it's kind of like in the Marine Corps, we say that we train to a standard, not to a time. So it doesn't actually matter how hard you work. What matters is what you get out of that work. So working efficiently, maybe not as grindy and as hard might actually have a better outcome. So the point that I'm trying to really drive home in this case is that rigor comes in different shapes and forms, but it's about having a very thorough approach, which we'll talk about more in a little bit. Self-aloof. This is probably one of the biggest ones on this list. This is where we really don't go through the process of critically self-analysing ourselves. It can be really uncomfortable.

So we avoid those things. And again, this is one of the beautiful things about the military, is you're going to get over that real, real fast because you're going to put on blast in front of everybody whenever you mess up and you have to be okay with it, otherwise you won't survive. So one of the big things that I try to remind people in the prospect of trading is that this series of really trying to understand yourself, your tendencies, your traits is extremely important. And if you lack the ability to deeply self-analysed and identify both strengths and weaknesses and really acknowledge those weaknesses, trading would be very difficult. Emotional processing. This is where you see traders say, like, oh, I got greedy. Or, oh, this should have happened. Or I got scared. Emotions are natural and contrary to popular belief in trading, you're not actually meant to be a robot. You're still a human being. And that's actually one of those sources of edge that's available is discretion. However, you have to develop a relationship with your emotions and understand how to regulate them.

If you're the kind of person that you're in traffic, somebody cuts you off and you get viscerally mad about that, you have road rage like most people do. But again, remember, we have to do things differently than most people here. Then that doesn't bode well in trading. It means that you literally lack self-discipline and you can't control an emotional response to something. That is going to be a common theme as we go through this. And then goalie locks analysis. This is where you just focus on the pieces of something that you like. So for example, if we're modeling a trade, we really favor looking at the parts that we like. What are we going to do with the money that we make? What are we? How are we going to manage the profit as we make profit? Meanwhile, we spend exactly zero time thinking about what's going to happen if it goes against us.

And as you already probably guessed, if you want to be successful in trading by definition because the vast majority of traders do fail, you literally have to be an outlier. That means that you literally have to do things differently than everybody else. And you have to be willing to do the work that other people are not willing to do. So you have to adopt that mindset right from the jump. You got to be different. And it's not that you have to be born different. It's that you have to adopt in a different approach, which is one of the cool things about trading is that this is genuinely accessible to all of us. Self-critical, you have to be able to analyze yourself objectively. So people struggle with this massively. And it's because we have a really perverse relationship with our perception of ourselves.

If you're too risk averse, the market's going to find that because you're going to have trades that eventually do go your way, but you're going to not have enough risk on because you're scared to lose money.

And that's the cool part is you don't have to have all of this dialed in before you start, but you have to be receptive to the information as it comes in because it will. Now, organization is non-negotiable. And if you're one of those people that you think that you're going to memorize everything and that you can just go off the cuff, it'll be easier that way.

You have to be organized. You have to have some sort of approach to collect quantitative and qualitative feedback for your approach so that you can then make the adjustments and changes that we just talked about. Emotional regulation. This is again, something that applies to people who maintain their composure in life in general. Again, using a fighting example. If you see mixed martial artists as they start a fight, if they're well disciplined and trained, they're very relaxed. Whereas if you look at the normal person, if they're in a fight, they're very tense, everything's super tight, they're not loose. Their movements are very jagged. And it's because they haven't trained themselves to withstand that kind of stress. So a big part of becoming successful in trading psychologically is slowly increasing your exposure. The composure of a mixed martial artist doesn't happen overnight. It happens by them going in the ring, sparring, doing things like that. Getting used to seeing punches come really close to their face, but not overreacting, opening up another opportunity. That takes time. It takes repetitions and having a pragmatic approach where you slowly build your tolerance over time is going to be exceedingly important. And again,",

And again, you have to identify what your emotional tendencies are. Do you act erashenly when you're scared? Do you get scared easily? Are you like me where you're a little bit too risk averse so that when you see a trade start not going the way that you thought it should, do you want to immediately intervene and do something that sabotages the outcome of the system? Understanding your tendencies is unequivocally one of the most important things you can do in this process. Now, the last thing I want to know on this side specifically is this idea of trade and confidence because a lot of people get a completely misunderstood concept of confidence. Confidence isn't something that you can manufacture. You can't fake it. Confidence comes from the consistent demonstration of a skill set. So, for example, if I was going to go out and shoot a basketball and if I've shot a basketball tens of thousands of times before, I'm going to be confident at least that I'm going to get off a decent shot. And the probability that it's going to go into depending on how far away I am is probably pretty good. So that's not",

So that's not because I walked out without ever touching a basketball and just thinking, oh, yeah, this is going to go great. You can't fake the funk. And again, the problem with trading is that it's going to show all these little cracks. So the way that you build confidence is through demonstrating the skill set over time. One of the best ways to do this is through paper trading, which I'll throw a link in the notes below that talks about that a little bit more. But this is a simple way to build confidence so that you're not out there unsure of what's going to happen. You're not comfortable with your plan because he didn't take the time to build a good plan because you didn't apply any rigor to it. You just slapped something together. And because you wanted to make a bunch of money because you don't understand the landscape and think this is going to be easy. That's going to lead to losing buckets of money. All right.

So let's fly through some of these other things that you have to be aware of specifically your cognitive biases. And there are a lot of them. If you go over to my website outliertrading.io underneath resources, there is a thing here called trader decision making cognitive biases. I literally list out 24. I'm not going to go through them here. The reason why you need to know these is because these plague literally all of us. And the reason why cognitive biases exist is because they impact most people going back to this point over here to succeed. You literally need to be an outlier. It means you need to do things differently. It means you need to understand what most people do so that therefore you can do it differently and more successfully. So the cognitive biases really influences most of our decision making in different ways. Take time to get familiar with this. The other thing that you have to be aware from a bias perspective is called the Dunning Kruger effect. I specifically give it a little focus thing down here because this will destroy most people.

You think you know more than you do at this point. That's essentially what that means. Then you are introduced to the fact that you don't. And you make a mistake and you end up losing a bunch of money. For me, this was about five years into my trading career where I had on a single trade over a 30 drawdown on my account. Pretty dumb looking back, but it makes complete sense because I had been trading for some time at that point. I've put in hundreds and hundreds of hours into learning and studying and I thought I had it figured out. It didn't. But then over time, if you stick with it over time, it builds and builds and builds. So for those that are curious about like this mastery thing that's there's a couple studies out there that 10,000 hours of a skill set typically leads to mastery, quote unquote. And for that in context, that means that you need to spend at least five hours every single day for five and a half years nonstop, not skipping a single day to hit that 10,000 hour mark.

We actually have to flip that script entirely. And we have to look for I call notes. We have to look for reasons not to do things. We have to look to poke holes in our ideas, not to blindly try to support them. Again, you have to do things differently. Being wrong. This is a tricky one. We all have an ego. The ego doesn't like to be challenged or bruised. But we have to get really comfortable with being wrong all the time. The way that we do that is we detach our self worth from being wrong.

So the easiest thing to do here is learn that being wrong is part of the process. You don't have to stay slaved to your ideas, your theories. You need to apply this over here, which is Bayesian analysis. This is what I call strong convictions loosely held. It means that you try to form the best idea that you can. But then as soon as there's new information that causes you to think about it differently or give you a different outcome, you drop the other thing like a rock and you adopt the new thing that's based on new information. But it has to be well justified. You can't just flip flop unnecessarily. You have to have a pragmatic approach to receiving new information, baking it into the existing information, and then coming up with a new conclusion that either supports or forces you down a different path.

Regarous analysis summarized is you have to do the hard work. That's all there is to it. You have to take the time. You can't accept easy answers. So for example, if a trader has a trade that was a winning position and then it turns into a losing trade, a lot of times they'll summarize that as, oh, I got greedy. Well, maybe that's a superficial answer. Because if you know about expected return, you know that you actually need to have trades that overcome your losing trades. So it might not have been that you were greedy. It might be that you didn't actually take the time to build an approach and follow that. So you're blaming it on something I call it false attribution, where you're not even going to be able to look in the right place because you haven't identified the correct spot to look. Okay. So now let's talk about three simple steps to transform your trading psychology. This is something we already talked about. I have to reiterate the point because it's one of the most important ones here. You have to do and act differently than everybody else that's trading because the vast majority of them fail. So if you see a lot of traders looking left, you",

You have to do and act differently than everybody else that's trading because the vast majority of them fail. So if you see a lot of traders looking left, you might want to look right. You have to understand that this is a really challenging thing that takes time to build over time, but it's entirely doable. But you cannot be lazy about it. This leads to the next point, which is if you are not willing to challenge your own thoughts and quantify what you're doing and analyze it, this is not for you. So what that means is if you've never looked through a trade log because you haven't built one, I don't understand how you could possibly think that trading is magically going to work out for you. This is like trying to start a business and not tracking your finances as a business. That business probably will not succeed. Same thing here. Last thing, build the skill set. The way everything else will slowly start to fall into place is if you take the time to build a skill set. So for example, the way that you build or get over the idea of being greedy is by taking the time to test a strategy, build the approach, track the results, know what to do.

So then when the trade's on, it's not a function of being greedy or not. It's a function of letting the trade do what it's supposed to do. The way that you overcome the vast majority of the psychological challenges of trading is to build the skill set based on actual work that you can actually look at and analyze and feel confident in the overwhelming majority of traders struggle building confidence or executing a plan because they don't believe it and why should they? The majority haven't taken the time to build something that they can trust. The last thing I want to show you are a bunch of different studies and I recommend looking these up. These are available for all the outlier pro members on Patreon. You can download them for free and you have access to all of them automatically. Everybody else, you can just look them up. None of this is paid. You can get access to all of this. This simply talks about a lot of the different qualities of traders in terms of their emotional processing and decision making. And again, the reason why we study what most people do is because we know we need to do something different than all of them.",
