    "text": "bit of an interesting week ahead for GameStop. The shareholder meeting was moved again. Now I think it's Monday, but a couple people sent in a few things from good old Super stonk about options. And as you know, I'm a dude ready to talk about some options, even if it's like 70 and sunny here in the middle of a Sunday afternoon in San Diego, I'm here for you guys. It's mostly just because I find this stuff fascinating. But the, I just want to talk through essentially these two different things people sent in. One of them is about implied volatility over the weekend. And the other one is about kind of the paradox of buying far out of the money options and why it's a bit of a trap in a lot of different ways. The goal here is just to give you information so that you can make better educated decisions when it comes to options because they can be tricky. The learning curve for them is very steep upfront. Once you know how they work, it's kind of like knowing anything else. I like cars. So if you're in auto mechanics is the same thing. When you first look at it, you have no idea what you're staring at. But then once you get it, you kind of get it. It's the same thing with options. It's really nothing that complex. So I'm going to break this all down. Barney style for us all. Now",

So I'm going to break this all down. Barney style for us all. Now first, let's talk about this. This post from good old boss blunts is GameStop implied volatility continues to rise this weekend. So they're talking about this option and they're essentially saying, Hey, what's going on over the weekend? Imply volatility is moving and it may or may not be. And in this case, it is, but it's not. And I'll explain exactly what that means. So if we take a look at my ugly mug from a screenshot, this is a video that I did Friday after the close. Take a look at the implied volatility for this coming expiration cycle, which is 21 June in GameStop. The implied volatility for this chain at this time was 234 4.71. I kind of blow it out because this is a little bit blurry. So in general, implied volatility doesn't move that much over the weekend. Now, if we take a look at what it is today, there's a pretty big variance. So right now, the implied volatility is 272.46, which is a 37 point difference that sure as heck looks like implied volatility increased. Correct? Yeah, absolutely. If we take a look at the implied volatility across these different time frames,",

If we take a look at the implied volatility across these different time frames, especially for something like GameStop, it's been very front loaded. Normally, it's the opposite. Normally, the further out in time you go, you expect to see a bigger, relative move over that time frame. But in this case, there's a lot of conjecture going on in the short term, a lot with the shareholder meeting and whatnot. And we actually can kind of see that. So I want to show you what I'm seeing. If we take a look at this coming expiration, let me scoot this down. This might be weird to you up front. So let me explain what you're looking at. This is looking at the implied volatility for out of the money options. So right now, GameStop closed at 2870. So that means that 2870s about right here. So everything to the left of this line is out of the money puts. Everything to the right of current spot price is out of the money calls because this is looking at out of the money options. And this goes back to kind of options 101. If we go again, just pop up in the chain, maybe make it a little easier. This is the call side.",

If we go again, just pop up in the chain, maybe make it a little easier. This is the call side. This is the put side. Notice how everything with a strike price above the current price, those are out of the money. And then on the put side, it's the inverse. If your strike price is below the current price, they're out of the money. So it's important because if we take a look at this, you'll notice something, especially if you trade options with any sort of frequency, there's something anomalous here. It's just massive call skew, massive call skew in terms of volatility. And in terms of implied volatility for this reference time frame, because notice how much higher this line is for the out of the money calls relative to the out of the money puts normally, that's the inverse. So to show you what this might look like normally, let's grab something like SPX. And we'll go down to the same thing. This looks super noisy right now because you notice this is using a ton of different explorations. So to kind of clean this up a little bit, let's just pick something that's a little further out, not like that, maybe trying to find like a good, oh, here we go, 19 July, here we",

So if we look at the out of the money options here in something like SPX, notice it's actually quite literally the exact inverse because we typically see puts trading with more vol than calls. The market over emphasizes downside risk and you will typically see more vols to things that experience downside risk. So in this case, puts so all these out of the money puts are way jacked up as compared to the calls. And again, if we go back to game stop and again, let's clear out all this noise. We'll look at this near term expiration. It's literally the exact inverse, which is really interesting.

Unfortunately, again, based on my best calculations that I can see, I don't think he exercised. And I'm not here to spread fun. I know people are like really, really concerned about that.

The reason why I don't think he exercised is because he would have lost millions of dollars to do that. He had not a ton of extra value left, but he had enough that it would have been literally like three or four million dollars just vanish. So he could have exercised some, he could have not to me as a right now. It looks like he didn't exercise again. It's just my best guess. He could have exercised. It's no way really to know.

But anyways, the reason why all that matters is because the fact that we didn't see much of a move on Friday from this. And it doesn't look like there's a ton of squeezing happening just yet. And sometimes stuff like that can take time to build up. What I'm highlighting is that there's no clear massive catalyst that I can see right now that leads to this. So this is interesting to me. The reason for that is because this isn't even an earnings release. This is literally a shareholder's meeting. The fact that implied volatility is this high for a shareholder's meeting is freaking fascinating to me. That is not common at all. This is almost like what you would expect to see from a biotech stock that's going through some sort of FDA approval phase. Really, really interesting. So who knows, but what I can tell you again, objectively speaking, massive, massive call IV skew that's pricing in an upside move. That's that's literally what I can see here.

Again, just trying to call it as I see it. All right, let's talk about the last thing that somebody was cool enough to send in. And it's this meme, which is actually pretty hilarious as I think about it. Let me blow it up just a little bit. And essentially, this is talking about a little bit of the problem with buying far out of the money calls. And a lot of new people that trade options this guy is thinking that's a good move. But then there are a couple components. And actually, this isn't fully accurate either. And I'll explain why. But there's a couple components to this that make this not as appealing as it might seem.

I'm going to explain exactly what the mean. Let's focus on this. Right now, this is looking at something where the spot price is kind of essentially right in the middle here. And this is showing you two different expiration cycles, 31 days to expiration, 325. Notice the longer term expiration cycle has this nice gentle slope. And notice how the 31 DTE starts to have this really steep slope. And if we look at this coming expiration cycle, it's five days. So it's a very, very small subset of this. So this would be like almost purely vertical. Here's what's happening. Here's what this is telling you. Options have to make a choice. Either they're going to be in the money within intrinsic value, or they're going to be out of the money and worth nothing at expiration. So options that are out of the money are all extrinsic value, which is time value and volatility. Essentially, those are the two components for extrinsic value. When we look at intrinsic value, that's simply how far in the money something is. So for the call side, again, notice this shaded area. This is just telling you, if you look at the price of GameStop, again, when it closed, 2870, all of these strikes that are below GameStop spot price, those calls are",

Those have intrinsic and extrinsic value. But something happens. When we go, let me kill some of these strikes. So it's a little easier to see. When we go further in the money, we have more and more intrinsic value and less extrinsic value. Quick cheat code you can use that works in most scenarios. Now GameStop, it doesn't work quite perfect or near as perfect simply because this is such a skewed environment in terms of volatility. But it's a good general rule that you can use anyways, which is if you want to know how much extrinsic value is left for a deep in the money option, you can just look across the aisle and look at the corresponding out of the money option. So what that typically would look like for this 22 strike. If I look at this, it's obviously a few bucks in the money like six dollars or so. How much extrinsic value do these options have left? One, you could do the math. Literally, you could just take the difference between spot price, strike price, and then refer that to the premium. That's extrinsic value. Or you can just look",

So this looks like 2526 cents of extrinsic value left in these options. Something like that. Okay, deeper in the money you go, the less extrinsic value you have. Now further out of the money you go, it's actually the same thing. And why? It's because the options are cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. There's only 25 cents of extrinsic value in these 105s. They're just very, very cheap. Why does that matter? Well, because when theta decays, the theta decay curve is highest or options that are at the money because there's the most extrinsic value. And theta decay actually slows down as you go deeper in the money because there's less extrinsic value. And theta decay slows down when you go further out of the money because there's less extrinsic value. That is as a gross dollar amount. So what I mean is if we look at theta decay here, for the at the money's ish, it's like 40 cents. If we go super far out of the money, you'll notice it's all the way down to like 15 cents. It essentially slows down a lot as a gross amount. But if",

If so, then we would buy them. We typically would call them something like kicker options.

The vast majority of my premium buying, whether it's calls or puts is going to be greater than 60 days. And why is that? Because of this, if you notice, this is looking at an at the money option, how it's theta decays over time. And notice what happens essentially from 100 to 60 days. This slope is not that big. But then notice once you get within 60 days to 40, 40 to 20, 20 to 10. And then all the way in, beta starts decaying super, super fast on a relative basis to the remaining premium.

So it's a way to not lose a bunch of money, but you're probably going to lose a whole bunch of times before you might win once. And you would have to manage it very, very smartly in order to have a positively expectant scenario. So I really, really like this post because it's reminding people that what looks really appealing, aka super cheap options, actually have a lot going on underneath the surface that make them very difficult to make money with. The last thing I'll say is the further out of the money you go, the lower your delta is. And for those that don't know, delta is simply the rate of change of premium for one point move in the underlying. So what that means is if GameStop goes up by a dollar, these 42 calls have a delta of 24. So if GameStop goes up by a dollar, this premium will change by 24 cents. Whereas if you pay up a bit more and you're closer to add the money or even slightly in the money. Now if GameStop moves a dollar, you see 50 cents of that move. And if you're",

Or you can play a little more conservatively like I typically do. I would go slightly in the money, pay up for the options. I would still have a management plan in place. I at no point would expect to just hold these into expiration because then you do run the risk of losing more money if these fall out of the money. I wouldn't want that to happen.

    "text": "the money. I wouldn't want that to happen. But you can get stuff that's in the money, get a better delta for dollar move based on what you put in a little more expensive. And then you could also add a couple kicker options, maybe like a 20 delta, something like that in case you get that big move. But if you get a bit of a move, but not big enough in order to make a bunch of money, you can still walk out with a bit of a profit by having a slightly higher delta. They're completely, completely intricate game to play. And this is why options are so cool to me because they're a puzzle that you get to solve for yourself, depending on what you want to do. But this is such a great point. If you buy super far out of the money calls or puts super far out of the money options, the vast majority of the time, you were just lighting that money on fire, difficult to make money that way. So as always, if there's anything else you want me to take a look at with respect to options, I'm happy to help and jump in as much as I can. I'm now as invested in this game stop story and saga is you guys are you guys have got me absolutely fascinated by everything that's going on. I'm actually looking forward to the shareholder meeting now and seeing how things go.",
