    "text": "24 bucks you're going to see 80 bucks 80 cents times 100 that's the multiplier for options contracts so it's a bit of a balance that's the cool part about options you get to set them up to be exactly what you want if you expect a big big massive move and you're super convicted you can go further out of the money and play the expansion of those Deltas or you can play a little more conservatively like I typically do I would go slightly in the money pay up for the options I would still have a management plan in place I at no point would expect to just hold these into expiration because then you do run the risk of losing more money if these fall out of the money I wouldn't want that to happen but you can get stuff that's in the money get a better Delta for dollar move based on what you put in a little more expensive and then you could also add a couple kicker options maybe like a 20 Delta something like that in case you get that big move but if you get a bit of a move but not big enough in order to make a bunch of money you can still walk out with a bit of a profit by having a slightly higher Delta it's a completely completely intricate game to play and this is why options are so cool to me because they're a puzzle",
