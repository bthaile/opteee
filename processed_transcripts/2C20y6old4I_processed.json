And let's contextualize this. So if we go into spy, or not, we're going to nothing, we go into spy, and analyze the movement here. We can look at and actually calculate the compound annual growth rate, right? So we can see what the overall risk is, but this will also show you draw downs. Here. So if we take a look at downside deviation, it'll move around 2.8, the maximum draw down that you had was 24 in this time frame. And this time frame wasn't that nasty, by the way. So without getting into skew, the kurtosis, those kinds of metrics, what I want you to pay attention to is that in the pursuit of getting your standard return and let's see what that was here in this context, 14, ish, for the period 14.59. So its compound annual growth rate was 14.6. So to get your 14.6, you had an 18 down year, and you also had a 24 draw down. Yet, there are still",

So to get your 14.6, you had an 18 down year, and you also had a 24 draw down. Yet, there are still traders out there under the guise that they're going to be able to smash the performance of the benchmark and have less risk doing so. I regret to inform you, Santa Claus also is not fucking real. And neither is this. Now what we can do is structure portfolio that makes sense and that's robust and resilient so that as it goes through draw down, and as it experiences risk, it's tolerable and it doesn't hurt us, that's good. So all that stuff aside, let's take a quick look through and see what comes to our mind. Well, a few things really stick out to me. Right now is a literally perfect time to start setting alerts. I have more alerts on right now than essentially ever before. And what I'm doing is I'm just perusing through a watch list of things that I'm interested in and I'm literally tracking them on their way down. So IonQ is one that I'm interested in and it's actually up a little bit today, interestingly. IonQ is a ticker I'm interested in. I really do want to gain exposure to this.

And we had talked about I want to put a ratio called diagonal on in here, because I like Amazon. But the issue is when this was happening, it was impossible for me to rationalize it. It couldn't be rationalized at this juncture. And I haven't redrawn this line and it's just been cratering. Now it just closed below a 100 day moving average and it has a ways to go at this point, which is actually a little deeper than I would have expected.

So those are positions that are put on to gain exposure, but they're not sized up as like full trades. And it's because again, uncertainty working with an ambiguous environment. Now today I was able to scale in, but guess what that means? Even though they were showing a profit from Friday into today, they're not showing anywhere near the size of profit that they would have if they were full size trades. That's the drawback of my style of trading is I don't wait for excessive confirmation, but I absolutely wait for base level confirmation so that I'm not playing the game of putting trades on that continually move against me and stop me out, that just increases transaction costs, which for larger portfolios is kind of annoying. Because even to put on trades at size, even with pretty solid negotiated commissions is not easy. So you get in a bit of a sticky spot with a portfolio trying to phase into a position. Now this here still looks interesting, but this is no good. This is not a company that I would want to take to the short side personally. I like",

And it still might because it's still in a general ascending pattern, but now what I need to do is set up a bunch of alerts really quick so that I can monitor how it behaves against this broader trend line that looks to be developing from here, here, here, here. I'm a down here. Not so much. I would prefer to draw it from here. I think that this is more relevant. So this is now another one that we need to watch, or at least I need to watch.

Now I still do have exposure like I already told you via the coverage triangle on a couple other ratio called diagonals, like I still have that ratio called diagonal and palancier, it's looking ugly now. It's no longer a profit at all, it wasn't profit previously, but not no more. And unlike what I've been doing with the covered strangle and phasing out of the profitable position as it's contracting so that I'm locking in a profit and decreasing total risk until I get to my desired risk allocation, which is what I'm at now.

Now, one of the notes though is I absolutely and willing to continue phasing these positions on. The problem is I can't fully rationalize it right now. And what I do is I settle alerts so that as they start to recover and look healthy, then I can get back in. And the reason why I use short puts is because it's a way for me to monetize the downside move, the expansion and volatility. Most of those, I mean, I'm less than, I'm about 54 utilized in TQ's, 50 utilized in SSO, 48 utilized in IBIT. Yet for all of them, the cheapest premium return on capital that I'm getting right now for the duration, which is 30 days for most of them, around 30 days or so, is over 3. So it means that on those puts for the allocated capital I'm making 3 of the money. And that's okay for me. Now that's not gonna pace if the market is flying, which is why I phased into equity during those phases. But this is exactly how I use two different methodologies at well,",

Now that's not gonna pace if the market is flying, which is why I phased into equity during those phases. But this is exactly how I use two different methodologies at well, three different methodologies in one strategy. When I'm trading the covered string goal, I'm trading via dollar cost averaging, short puts below basis, value averaging, trimming off risk from selling equity position as I get favorable moves, and then also risk premiums through the short options legs. So maintaining that total split, it gives me a way to make money even though, for example, while I've been in T-Triple Q's, the underlying is had a 6.5 positive move from when I first entered, but the covered string goal position that I'm in right now is up 11.2. So it's almost double. And then if I look at SSO, SSO is up 0.33, and the return on invested capital for the covered string goal is 2 is of now, which is obviously with that contraction. So a lot of these based on, that's based on the open position as well, by the way, because I've phased out of quite a lot of these. And it's just so that I'm not holding stuff as it's going down, it's bad practice, tough way to make money that way. So that's what I'm seeing in general. Now we can take a couple minutes if",

It's aggressive enough and broad enough that this is why I'm not nibbling on the way down. It needs to normalize a little bit. Dark Jen says, look at GME, exclamation point. Unfortunately, you're missing literally the golden way to phrase that. The way that your grandma would force you to phrase that in order to get what you want with a higher likelihood.

To the bottom end. But it's now closing below really long term moving averages. Breath is not looking good. It's effectively rolling over. So we need to see if it starts to consolidate anywhere in here. And if so great, but right now it's simply not. So it's been on a pretty steep decline, even given its slight breath of air on Friday. So I'll do a deeper analysis with GameStop tomorrow. If you have any specific questions on it, happy to take a look. But I'll save like the the thorough looking through the option, showing you the volatility and all that stuff. I'll save all that for the video tomorrow.

No, it's a different fucking trade. So the ultimate summary for all of this though is that regardless if you do it this way or if you just keep your basis at whatever it is, it's all gonna come out in the wash. Your aggregate PNL is the exact same. So I think it's so much better and way more beneficial to the trader to just accept the basis as whatever it is. Don't do this bullshit of trying to adjust your basis using money from other trades because then if we're rolling the call, do we adjust our basis up? I've never heard of anybody do that, which is interesting. Weird, huh? But we're okay with adjusting it to the side that's favorable to us. Doesn't make any sense.

But we're okay with adjusting it to the side that's favorable to us. Doesn't make any sense. Reese says, Nike, what do you make of names that show strength in a market like this? Well, I think Nike has just been looking really terrible I think it's too early to tell in terms of showing market strength because they're also moving on news. So it's not the same thing. If it's something that is moving because of overall strength, that's one story, but I don't think that's the story as it sits right now with Nike. Because if I look at Nike in a broader context, it's terrible. So I think the movement that you're seeing in Nike is movement that's coming from a company that's been cut in half plus over the last three years. And they still have a viable business. They can only go so low. And I think it's mostly that tied with some news. So I like I do think that to your broader point that there are pockets of strength that you will find right now today. We can literally run a scan and see what did that exact thing for us because it exists. I look at it every single day and there are always names that do this for us that perform. But this wouldn't be one",

I look at it every single day and there are always names that do this for us that perform. But this wouldn't be one of them in my world personally. So if we take a look at things that have had a pretty solid day that have had a completely different story, I was so stupid. So I literally was going down to type in the ticker, but I forgot that I pulled out this little drawing pad here. This is what I draw on for you guys. And I was like about to type in on the drawing pad instead of the keyboard. Totally, totally miss that. But something like this. CYD. CYD is been crushing it. And it's been crushing it since the 14th. This popped up on my list on this day. And this is a simple literally just long trade. Now I don't love the overall ticker. The reason I don't love it is because I'm not a big fan in investing in Chinese companies. It's just because I don't have enough confidence in the reporting. I just know that the way that they do accounting is different. And there is some fuckery of foot sometimes. But I won't deny movements either.

The reason why CMPX is on here, by the way, it might not look as impressive because it's down 8 over the last five days. But over the last year, it's 73 six months is 146. So the company is still doing very, very well. CURI is another one. HIMS just got smashed. HIMS just got taken out to the wood shed. So yeah, HIMS is a different story.

I think the broader answer though for you, send your H is the only reason really to automate as a retail trader is if you find some monochrome of convenience from it, but you're not going to find like edge automating. Your edge is going to have to be found somewhere else. Now, what I would say is that if I personally had a passion for automating things, I would go work at a quant fund or I would go work at a high frequency trading firm. And literally just make money for the firm on a salary. You'll definitely do way better than that. H says a few well-versed coders. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Then I think other than you guys being able to conveniently build stuff to help simplify stuff, like you're not going to be able to automate anything that's going to be even remotely competitive. So I think in that kind of scenario, if you guys want to do it, it's like a project because it's fun, then sure, I get that.

I think you'll find way, way, way more opportunity in the prediction markets. This is exactly what I would do. And it's because in the prediction markets, there are new enough that you can absolutely build your own edge. There now is a retail trader. And it's because institutions have not bled into it yet. So the time is actually ticking, though, in order for you to be able to do that. The reason why I don't personally do it honestly is because the markets aren't big enough for it to make sense for me. I make more money trading regularly. If I didn't and I was enterprising, that is 100 what I would be doing right now. Is I would either be cross exchange, arbitrage, or making sure to pay very close attention to the contract terms. You have to pay attention to the contract terms. Because I've seen people not look at that closely enough. And they think they're running an R, but they're not. So that's a fun fact. But I think that's exactly where I would go.

Look at that. 362,000 calls against 62,000 puts. So yeah, I mean, this thing's really, really well positioned. Most of the people funny enough are playing way near, oh no, they're not.

I think the name of the game here for it is, I wouldn't want to see it really fall below this previous surge up, right? If it starts falling below this, then the trend looks kind of dangerous. Like I actually don't like that it's falling below this consolidation. That's this line that I drew here. It's kind of this little zone that you see between these three candles. This consolidation matters because this is after it had its little surge, couple of trickle updates, then when sideways, normally when we have stuff that's behaving like really well from a breakout slash near term momentum style play, you'll see them stay within this range versus starting to take to play with it and to fall below it.

I'm waiting for the rest of chatGPTs analysis. Here. Talk analysis for EXC. And then let's go through here. I don't like when utilities have too high of a yield. And that's primarily because I prefer utilities companies that are successfully expanding and growing. So if we take a look. Yeah, their net income looks good. A little high on liabilities, but that's not abnormal for companies like this. Yeah. Yeah, I think this one looks really, really solid to be honest. And I love that they're pretty deeply involved in the nuclear power space. Because that's about to be much, much less deregulated. So that'll favor this company pretty heavily. Awesome. Yeah, great call out. I love that name. Good find. That might be one to add to the ratio called diagonal list. Because a couple of the others that I would prefer to trade have been moving too slow.

So as always, be an outlier. I'll see you later.",
