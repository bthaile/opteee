And essentially what I'm giving away is a quick one-on-one conversation with me, hopefully to take a look through whatever it is you're doing to see if we can find some things to focus on to help you with your path. And the reason why I selected that for the giveaway is because when I look at the overall path that I followed from trading, it started with a couple people, interceding in my life in a very positive way by essentially sharing information. And then it was me taking that information and continuing to grow rapidly. So I thought that sharing of information is essentially the exact way to kind of keep that theme. The big thing I continually think about is how can I continue paying forward the different things that people have done for me? Because I think it's not pay it forward in terms of like to repay a debt. I don't feel like it's a debt at all. But I do feel like somebody has set a really good example in my life on how to treat and think about other people. And I want to promulgate that because I think it's a good message.

And this is the next one is the fun one. How things started. So this is not my very first YouTube video. This video is like from the 22nd of May 2020. And this is like a couple weeks after I started YouTube. And effectively the entire Genesis for starting YouTube. It was during COVID. It was again May of 2020. I know the date really well, because it's the 4th of May. And I was having conversations with my military friends. I very I'm like an evangelist for things that helped me. And one of them is investing. Now most of my military friends, they're not going to be traders. And I know that they most of them they are in a different spot. They have different priorities. But there's still always a really great conversation. And there's always a great way to try and instill some basics. So that's really what I was doing. I was having phone calls with my friends. And I was essentially saying like, hey, where are you guys at with your finances? Because another thing that's different about the military world compared to the civilian world is people are pretty open with one another. It's not this game of like you have to hide or you can't",

And I'm actually having a lot of those conversations with my friends now, because I think the same. On a long term dollar cost averaging lens. And I found myself repeating myself because I was having calls. I was like directly calling them. Be like, yo, let's talk for a half hour hour or whatever. And I was repeating myself a lot. So then I was just like, I will make a YouTube channel. And I will record some videos about like the basics of budget, emergency savings, those kinds of things.

Now there is a really funny story leading into this that I do think is worth mentioning because it's just hilarious. It was probably six months to eight months before that. And before I started YouTube channel, I have had perpetually less than zero interest in social media. I really don't care at all about social media. The only social media that I've ever maintained typically was a Facebook. And that's because when I was on active duty, I would move around a lot. I wasn't near my family. So it was a way for me actually to stay in touch with my family to just keep a pulse and so that they could see some of what I'm doing. Typically what you would get if you live close to your family to see people in person. So that's really the only social media I had. And that's an important background because literally a disdain for social media. Then I'm sitting in my office one day trading just like this sitting right now where I'm at now.

And these bees, apparently, thought that they wanted to set up their house. They wanted to go right by one of my little rain gutters that takes off this little mini roof that's outside my office. And they were funneling in there. I didn't know this, but fun fact, we live on top of a hill. We're in a really, really cool spot because we're next to a nature preserve, although we're in San Diego. So we really don't have neighbors on an entire one side of the house. It's just open views. But one of the downsides of being on a hill, which I didn't know, is that when bee colonies split, they kick half the colony out. They bounce and they have to go find a place to live. Well, bees are a simple creature, which I fully identify with. And as these bees are cruising along, they essentially come up, pretend that this is a hill. They come up to elevation.

So the other thing I didn't know is bees have a memory on where they've previously established hives. And so I have a relationship with the prior owners of the house. They built the house. And I was just like, yo, you guys have ever any issue with bees and they're like, yeah, every once in a while they go and they knew exactly where they were. And I was just like, ah, okay. Call to beekeeper. Homeboy came out, took care of them, didn't kill them, vacuum them up, tried to move them. And what they do is they put chicken wire in the same spot because they'll still come every once in a while to try to get in there. And it's only that one. That's another really funny thing because outside my office, it's like a flat roof that's foam. They did a lot of like commercial grade stuff for some reason. There's a drain on this side. And then maybe 15 feet, 20 feet, there's a drain on the other side. The other side is not chicken wired or anything. They could easily go into that one. They don't care. They like",

The beginning had everything to do with just making some videos to try to help a couple of my friends have better conversations than people started leaving comments. And emailing me different questions. So I was just like, I'll make a video for this who cares. It literally takes me two seconds. And that's the literally the entire origin of the YouTube channel. Then I take a look at comparatively where we are today. And it's kind of crazy, right? Like you think it used to be just answering a couple of questions here and there. Now we literally have pretty much a stream every single day. There's a podcast part of this. There's a newsletter now. There's at least one week one video up to three videos a week.

And the reason why that it's so challenging is because the things that absolutely do well are things that I personally take issue with. I think it's a disingenuous. I think that it leads people literally to failure. Those kinds of things. So it puts me in a weird spot where the things that I know would work way better to continue growing are things I'm actively not willing to do. And then I kind of reconciled with myself. I was just like, literally just focus on continuing to get better at the craft within the bounds that I think are reasonable with within things that I'm comfortable with.

So there's two stories that I wanted to talk to you about. The first one on the left hand side, you can see this nice pie graph. They have 66.7 on the right and then 33.3 on the left. This pie graph represents something specific. But if you think about the beginning stages of trading, you all are fairly familiar with the Dunning Kruger effect. I've talked about it before a lot because I think it's very important. The Dunning Kruger effect very often happens very early on in your trading career. For me, it happened in a slightly prolonged time frame. And a big part of that is it just took me longer to figure this stuff out. When I first started trading in 2007, I like the resources available are nothing like what it is now at all. It's completely different. So a lot of it is this haphazard learning based on the stuff you can come across. So what this graph represents is actually the drawdown on my portfolio from a single very high probability trade that temporarily went against me. This literally was a several",

This literally was a several day trade where I eviscerated a third of the portfolio. And here's essentially what happened. I was trading really wide iron condors in the rut, though the Russell index itself. And it was a relatively quiet week. The market didn't have a whole lot going on. And I put on this sizeable relative to the account at the time. It was wide, the wings on the iron condor. And it was a really low delta for the shorts. And the reason I put this trade on, I remember it pretty clearly because this part's imprinted. It was like 500 and something dollars is what I was set to make. And I think I sold it. I don't remember the exact timing. This is a while ago. This happened maybe four or five years into my trading career. I could tell you exactly when it happened. When was it? Yeah, here. One, two, three, four, five years in. Five years into the trading career. And at this point, I'd been spending an insane amount of time. Because this is like post high school college.

And if you went to college, even though I was doing ROTC and stuff, like there's a lot of time in college for extra activities. And I was really efficient at school. I've been obsessed with efficiency my entire life. So this was what I was spending the absolute bulk of my time on. Even more than I was spending in classes and stuff for sure, I would go to my classes. But I mean, like the total composite time on, like the time you spent for classes versus the time spent on trading is way more. And I put on this really wide iron condor. It's a pretty short term trade, like a week, definitely less than two weeks. I don't think it was more than that. And I put this trade on and I was so focused on this idea of like, man, if I could make 500 a week doing this, how incredible would that be? How big of a difference would that make? And for me with where I was at that point in time, tremendous, literally massive difference in my life that would have made.

And I was linking up with my buddy that I played rugby with. And as before I went into the gym, took a look at the phone to see how the position was doing. And I saw that it was down big.

I've spent hundreds of hours learning about trading, practicing, testing, all this kind of stuff. So that was such a massive blow to what I thought I had learned. So this loss taught me a couple really important things. The first thing that it taught me is how important it is to spend time thinking through things objectively and less so from the lens that's most appealing to us. And the reason why that's a specific callout is because it's something you have to actively guard against. Because your brain naturally doesn't want to do that. It doesn't want to deal with the ugly scenarios that are likely to occur at some point. The other thing that this thing has taught me is my visceral reaction is a human being to seeing numbers on the screen and what those numbers meant.

And some people are like, oh, wow, you only drew down a third of the account. You didn't blow an account. That's incredible. Well, the fact is, at this point, I've been trading for a little while, experiencing some luck while saving. The amount that I lost on this is effectively the amalgamation of five to six to 10, depending on what the small account is that would have been blown. So the only reason why the account didn't blow is because at this point, I at least had a little bit of pocket change. The other thing is one of the main reasons why I started trading is to put myself in a position to be able to help my mom when she needed it. So I wasn't approaching this trading thing with the idea of like, oh, I'm going to yolo or I'm going to try to 1,000X my returns, right? Go back to the trade that led to this loss. It was a defined risk trade with really high probability. That's not somebody going out there to yolo. That's me trying to do something conservative",

So there's a couple things I highlight from this. These last two years are literally the two years where I've lowered my return target the most. I used to target at least 15 per year. And then I lowered it to 12, then to 10, then to 8. I didn't lower it because I couldn't hit it. I lowered it because I was at the amount of money I needed in order for the account to do what I wanted. But then these last two years, I effectively just needed to pace inflation. I think I set like a 5 or a 6 return target. And yet these years ended up being some of, well not even some of literally the two best years I've ever had. What did that teach me? It taught me something really important about the idea of pursuing good opportunities. Now I want to be very clear. My return in both of these years included a healthy dose of luck. The market was very accommodating to me and what I was doing. And I happened to overlay well with those.

The return is quite a bit larger than this actually. But I took that part of my return out because of how anomalous these couple trades were over just a couple days. And I told you guys a little bit about them. I'm not at a point where I'm ready to talk about them at all because it's stuff that I am still looking for. But in 2023, I had come across something that I had been looking for passively for a very long time. And as soon as I saw it, I understood what I saw.

Funny enough, Joey is highlighting one of the trades that was a one of my better trend following trades in APP. APP was a literal insane trade. That's a little too far, I think. I think I got rid of the drawings and stuff. I'd have to look at the actual dates. I want to say that I started getting in on this breakout. I don't remember where the breakout was.

But I had done a really good job of following this breakout essentially through this entire path.

This trade was an absolute insane return. It was really based on momentum following. I just use options to capitalize on it. That one was a really, really solid trade. The other thing that this grouping of years highlights to me that I want to share with you. It's a really powerful lesson that a lot of people I believe don't pay enough attention to, which is this. Most of my trading career is based on Portfolio 1. Portfolio 1 shows you something important. If we take a look at Portfolio 1, it shows you the different years of returns year, year 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. You can see the best return was 10. The worst was 2. If you compare that to Portfolio 3, the best return was 30. The worst was negative 25, but then the next three returns are 12, 14, 12. What do you notice? Well, this has a insanely good average return of 8.6 as compared to 7.4. Way better return. However, what do you notice about the ending value in the compound annual growth rate? The ending value is greater than this other approach that has a 1.2 higher average return and the compound annual growth rate is 7.35 compared to 6.87. What this is designed to show you is that there",

The ending value is greater than this other approach that has a 1.2 higher average return and the compound annual growth rate is 7.35 compared to 6.87. What this is designed to show you is that there are different ways to beat the market. One of the ways that you can beat the market as a retail trader is not by always outperforming it to the upside. Literally, the best year from Portfolio 1 doesn't beat anything other than the worst year in Portfolio 3, meaning all four other returns are better than the best year from Portfolio 1. The difference is this 25 drawdown versus this 10 year. That is something I think that is grossly under-disgust and under-appreciated because one of the easiest ways for you to win as a trader in terms of outperforming the market is not by outperforming the market to the upside every single year. It's when the market has these big down years. And if this is admittedly a really good return, comparative to this, not using this as the benchmark, but if the market drops 19 and you're positive 5, that is a massive gap that you now have over the stock market. And it's something to keep in the back of your mind, something that's really, really important because you do not always need to outperform the market in order to outperform the market.

And it's something to keep in the back of your mind, something that's really, really important because you do not always need to outperform the market in order to outperform the market. This also finally, to me, represents the maturation of a skill set. The fact that 22 shows you the ability to generate a positive return during a down year. The fact that there's two really, really solid years here. Now, to bring this all back to earth, my compound annual growth rate still, it used to be in the mid-20s. But now with the last two years factored in, it's 31.6, which is a crazy compound annual growth rate. And the main reason why it's that high is not because each year was this crack off of a year, although these two were, but it's because I've only lost money two years. It's my first two years of trading. In both of them, we're less than 5. I've had several years where I've underperformed the market to the upside. But I've almost always, no, after those first two years, I think I've always outperformed the market on down years. Because there weren't many. That's why I know. 2008, the market was down 37. I was down 4.2. 2018, the market was down 4.4. I was up 13.8. 22, market was down 19.4. I was up 21.2. So, yeah. That's a really powerful thing to",

If with this profile, you return 10 per year, you walk out with a really solid return of 1.2 million. If you outperformed that by average, taking it from a 10 return to a 25 return over this 20 year timeframe, you now have 6.7 million. The consistency in your returns can be one of the largest generators of your future wealth. Far none. Something to pay attention to. All right. Those are the two stories I have for you.

Reese says, did you ever dabble with investing or trader always? I started as a trader. I'm sorry, as an investor, but I invested for a few months before I pivoted to trading effectively. So what happened was the way I first started in markets was after that teacher introduced me to the idea of investing. I went up to the library at school. I remember this because in ROTC, that's the dude. He's a ROTC instructor. He introduced me to the idea of investing. Library was right above where the ROTC part of the school was. So I just walked up and I started just combing through stuff. And one of the things that he mentioned to me is, you know, a good starting point is to buy what you know. So at this point, I remembered things like Netflix were really, really exciting. The iPods were so cool. That was a really big thing.

So I started buying little tiny pieces of these different companies. And over the next few months, they actually started making a ton of money in terms of a percent return in terms of a gross dollar return. The positions were so small, it didn't matter. I didn't have much money. So I saw that momentum and I was thinking like, damn, if this is me just not doing anything else, then maybe if I got better at trading, I can make more money faster. And that's effectively when I made the jump into trading was pretty much a few months into when I first opened up my account and started buying those first few names.

And then I've stayed in angel investing more so because I think it's super, super interesting. It's not necessarily because it's the greatest returns on planet earth.

Obviously, it's awful, but there are decent returns, but it's not I would like if I had to pick one, I would pick trading for sure over angel, I just like it a lot. And then real estate, it's a great fit for the broader portfolio. It's just like the way I talked to you about trading where I always start at the portfolio level, then kind of click in and click in and try to build something based on this broader context of what my total portfolio looks like and what I think I need at the time, like those kinds of things. It's the same thing with my financial footprint. The thing that I try to remind people that is I also think broadly underappreciated is people think like, oh my god, trading is so risky. It's crazy to do that, but here's what I think about as a trader, you're on your phone clicking buttons, but here is one income stream. Then maybe as you're a trader, you also get in your car and you door dash. If you're a smaller trader, there's your second income. And then maybe you spend a little time figuring out how to fix things in between your door dashing and you proxy for jobs as a handyman. There's your third income and so on",

So you have your direct income. Then you have your investment income, multiple sources from both of them. This is a highly robust individual.

This lacks all robustness. As soon as this W2 is cut, this person is in a massively compromised situation. Either they need to find another job which is okay. A lot of people can accurately do that, but when you do that, you have to play the game. You literally have to essentially say, I need this W2 income so bad that I'm going to do whatever it takes and that comes with costs. It comes with costs on your time, your effort, where you're directing your energy. It comes out of cost of your morals, things that you agree with doing, things that you don't agree with doing, but you do it for the sake of the job because you really need the job.

Ben says, why did you choose this path instead of some of the other profitable traders who make higher returns? I've talked about this actually quite a lot. The main thing is when I first started trading, I valued consistency a lot and it's because I didn't know how good I was going to be or how viable this thing was going to be, but I thought being able to honestly outperform the market on most years would effectively serve my need and my need ultimately was to be in a position to take care of my mom. My mom was an occupational therapist for a public school district for mentally handicapped kids. She got paid nothing and she was a contractor. So she had no retirement with them and she's single. She's by herself. She's not good with money. So what does that mean?

Because again, let's just take a look at a couple scenarios. If we have this 25,000 account, let's say that you're better at saving. You have multiple jobs. You have 2,500 a month. You have a 20 year timeframe. And let's say again, you earn this modest return excess over the stock market of 15. Where does that put you in 20 years? Well, in 20 years, you'd be at 1.8 million outright in 20 years with this other return profile. You're at 3.5 million. That to me, this profile to me seemed very achievable. And that still put me in a position to have plenty of money. Now, it's been fortunate where again, my compound annual growth rate is effectively double that.

Ken Griffin 19. Dallio 14. The point that I'm making is like the fact that I'm even returning anything even close to what those kinds of people are is literally a miracle. And it's because the game's easier for me. Absolutely. When you're an institution at that size, there's skills far outweigh mine.

    "text": "you're an institution at that size, there's skills far outweigh mine. They're literally just laden down with their the rules they have to follow. So yeah, I'm not sure like the quote unquote path of other profitable traders and what it looks like. But I've been in this game long enough to know what's realistic over a long term timeframe. So if the suggestion is like that there's long term traders that are returning 75 compound annual growth rates over 25 years literally call utter bullshit on it. It's overwhelmingly not the case. So yeah, the thing that I've really valued is consistency. I think consistency really grants those core things that matter a lot to me, which is first freedom combined with being able to take care of my mom. But then after that's accomplished, kind of just continuing to pad things because as I continue to build more wealth, the reason why I'm focused on that is because it opens up more opportunities to do other things. So that's the that's the way I look at it. But I mean, even at this point now, we have way more than we need for sure. And I enjoy a lot the the world of trading. I am like, I'm essentially obsessed with markets. Markets are something that I I cannot express like how deeply I enjoy it. It's such a fascinating exercise, everything from mastery of yourself, ability to synthesize information, how good your systems are. I told you",

And then your ability to self regulate, self identify, there's so much to do and it's incredibly fun. So yeah, that's kind of where I'm at why I do things now. But with respect to, you know, the other traders thing, I honestly don't know who the other benchmarks you're using are. But I already know that based on what I can do that I'm probably pretty close to like what the terminal rate is because to be clear, I don't think I'm actually long term capable of a 31 compound annual growth rate. Like I fully expect that to guide down. And it's because I don't think I'm as good as people like Dr. Kim Miller or Simon's like, there's just a reality like those are really smart dudes that have built an empire around their skill set.

All right, onto the next thing, three lessons that effectively changed everything for me. The first one is the hardest hands down. The first one is that annoying advice you hear people say such as, don't worry about the money and it will come. Whenever I heard that early on, I was always like, bitch, I am worried about the money. I want the money. I'm so worried about the money. And then as I start to understand what that means, it's why I report the same message to you now. The world of trading is entirely about how robust, how effective your process is, how well can you ingest information, how well can you adapt and how well can you employ your skill set? If you become over focused on the output of an individual trade at any point in time, it is to your own detriment. No one trade matters provided that you have decent risk control measures. If you have 100 drawdown on a trade, then that trade mattered a lot, but it means you failed in other places. I mean, more so within the bounds of normal return profiles. The reason why process so matter so much is because you literally have to learn to reward yourself for following the process effectively and you have to reward yourself for emphasizing the process over",

So, I don't approach this comment from the concept of ego is bad. It's not, but it does need to be moderated because I do believe very frequently the ego can get out of control easily. And you can start, and this, by the way, this isn't something that's like relegated to men. That's another thing that's like complete bullshit where it's like men have big egos and women never do. It's not even about the external manifestation of the ego. I'm talking more so the internal manifestation of the ego in different ways.

One of them is if you are uncomfortable with placing a trade, let's say, let's say you're timid. You're uncomfortable placing a trade. And it's easier for you to avoid the discomfort of placing a trade by simply not placing a trade. That's an internal expression of ego that literally is led to a negative outcome if it's otherwise a trade that you should have placed based on your plan.

So when we think about how to think differently from a starting point, it's actually really simple. We should literally just think about it from well, how do other people do this? That's a great starting point. And then you can pivot off of that. Like for example, a lot of traders think from the point of convenience, what works for me? What do I prefer to do? That doesn't work well. And so on and so forth.

So it looks like there's 37. I'm going to call a bunch of them are going to be me. So let me, there's not that many. So let me scroll through this one. Two. Nine. 19. So you have a one in 19 chance of winning pretty good. All right. Chat you be to pick a number between one and 19. That's random. The number is 17. So that that looks like our boy, wheel, strat, Joe, who would have picked that? Congratulations to send your wheel, strat, Joe. If you shoot me an email, we'll find a time to talk a little bit about the stuff that you're doing on the portfolio. And to hopefully see if we can find a way to help out, you're an interesting case too. Honestly, exactly have talked to you for a while now in the discord. So I'm pretty excited from that lens because we'll have a pretty good starting point to work off of. So hopefully we'll be able to help out a little bit. I think so. All right. First off, last off, I guess I should say now, I am so stoked. Like I'm, it gives me so much purpose to have our community of people that are interested in this from",

Like I'm, it gives me so much purpose to have our community of people that are interested in this from the lens of somebody, I really enjoy teaching. And from the lens of somebody that enjoys teaching, having people that are genuinely interested in the stuff that you teach and the stuff that you work on is so cool. It's the ability to talk about this thing that I'm obsessed with with other people, which is incredible. It's so fun. So I am extremely eager. My goal for the end of the year is 40,000 subs. I am so far behind that it's not even funny. The probability of that happening is very low, but it's the goal I started with. So I will continue to reiterate that goal simply because if I don't hit it, then you all should also see me miss a goal. And I don't want to. I'm going to see what I can do to continue innovating and avoid that. But the other thing is, if I miss it, I miss it. The way I look at growing our community, I care so much more about having people find their way into our community that are quality people over the number of people.

The way I look at growing our community, I care so much more about having people find their way into our community that are quality people over the number of people. And remember, is why I care about subs on YouTube, honestly, it's two reasons. The first one is because it does show, it's a benchmark that I can measure that does show if more people are interested in staying around because then that obviously reflects that I'm doing stuff that they find valuable. This second thing is when I'm reaching out for podcasts and stuff like that, it's much easier to talk to people and to invite them on to collaborate on content or to record a podcast if you have a following. There's a lot of other people that's a big factor for how they choose to get their reputation out. So that's just the reality of things. So from those two lenses, it does matter to me. But I am really, really stoked to keep talking along with everybody. As always, if you need anything, you can always find me around in the discord and be an outlier. See you guys later.",
