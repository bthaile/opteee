Because everybody is going to go through this at some point. And there's essentially a graph that looks something like this up here. And there's a point where after you've been trying to learn something for a while, you've been spending hours and hours and hours studying, practicing, you start to think that you really know what you're doing. And unfortunately, that's a really dangerous point. Because you know enough to be dangerous, but you don't know what you don't know yet. And that's typically when most of us make massive mistakes, blow up a counter, like me, have massive drawdowns, way back when I first started trading.
