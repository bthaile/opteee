    "text": "what's up outliers got another email asking to look at djt again and a couple comments asked if we could look at a few times leading into the election which makes sense to me happy to do so and there was actually a couple things that happened yesterday that I thought were really interesting and I want to talk about it so first here you can see on the chart we have uh spy q's and iwm and you can see over the last two days spy has been running slightly negative iwm has been running negative and q's got a little bit of a bite today and yesterday had a pretty big down day and then notice djt it is up on yesterday hitting new highs and today it's hanging out round about there as well so what's going on here and why do I find this interesting well it tells us a few things definitively now we have a lot of ideas around djt and how that's behaving and whatnot but from a a broad perspective this is adding a pretty significant clarifying structure which is there is pure speculation going on right now and this is being used as speculation to the probability of winning an election now I think most people already generally thought that but the reason why it's so interesting now is that this isn't just following along with General market beta in adding a little bit of spice on top of it this",
