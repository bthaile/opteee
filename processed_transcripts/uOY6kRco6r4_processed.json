Yeah looking forward to it let's go. Sounds awesome. So starting zoomed out zooming in you and I have talked a few times and I like kind of getting deeper and deeper into detail. Most people are familiar with your background. I do want to talk a little bit about your book later retail options trading that you wrote with Andrew Mac which is a really good read. I was actually set to talk to him. He was going through some health stuff but I'm set to reach back out to him soon and also chat with him. But to kick off at a high level thinking about 2024. If you were to recap 2024 from your own trading and market lens. What sticks out to you any lessons learned anything draw your attention from last year specifically. The other thing I really remember is being slightly unusual day was the August the 5th I think it was the Monday after Japan Japan dropped Sunday night.

It leads to a broader not like philosophical question but definitely thoughtware question I definitely notice throughout my life that people that tend to do things longer longer tend to continually simplify like what they're doing and get really good at staple components of whatever that thing is whether it's things in rugby whether it's in trading jiu jitsu like a lot of these things I see that people have been doing for a long time it really does seem like over their careers things become simpler and it sounds almost similar in a way to what you're doing at a higher level what do you make of that trend is that something that you agree with or disagree with and if so what's",
