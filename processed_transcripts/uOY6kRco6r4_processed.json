I noticed. But it looks like you have the the think tank ready to have a conversation about options trade and a. Yeah, looking forward to it. Let's go. Sounds awesome. So starting zoomed out zooming in you and I have talked a few times and I like kind of getting deeper and deeper into detail. Most people are familiar with your background. I do want to talk a little bit about your book later retail options trading that you wrote with Andrew Mac, which is a really good read. I was actually set to talk to him. He was going through some health stuff, but I'm set to reach back out to him soon and also chat with him. But to kick off at a high level, thinking about 2024, if you were to recap 2024 from your own trading and market lens, what sticks out to you any lessons learned anything draw your attention from last year specifically. Well, the only thing I really remember is being slightly unusual day was the August the fifth. I think it was the Monday after Japan, Japan dropped Sunday night.

And the next day, nothing really happened to me to it absolutely bananas, right? The big went up to I think mid 60s, in today. From I can't remember where it opens like around 20, I think it close in the mid 30s. That was a, that was a very unusual day. It's almost like, and I don't want to be like one of these people who are like the reason this happened is because there were a lot of shorts concentrated. I mean, no one knows that stuff. I mean, basically that's a good filter. If you're listening to someone on YouTube or Twitter or something, if they start going on about that stuff, you can probably tune out a lot of the other stuff basically too. But it was very interesting the way that VIX massively over reacted. Yeah. But that wasn't the interesting thing. The interesting thing was the SP VIX went above the NASDAQ VIX. And that happens almost never. Like about two and a half, three percent of the time, depending on the look back your area you've got. So to me, that was people, people ask me like, you know, what's",

Should I look forward to what I do a trade? What should I be looking forward to try and get edge? The best way to do it is to know what something normal is like. You know, don't think about the abnormal just become so familiar with how things usually are, but then something different happens. You're like, oh my god, that's, that's not right. And then you can look for what's not right. And it's sort of a different way of approaching the world. I don't know if you've heard this story about the Chinese man who was sent to the Jade carving master to try and learn to carve Jade. And so every day the master gives him a piece of Jade and says, just hold it in your hand, just hold it. That's all he did. And I think students like, this is ridiculous. How am I learning from this in the master's like, you know, just trust me. After a year, student goes, wait, this thing you gave me isn't Jade. That's what you should be looking for when you're looking for edge as well. You should become so familiar with the normal situation",

They don't look for the thing that's standing out so much just look for the normal stuff and then like, it's kind of like a wears lolly, I guess. That thing doesn't fit.

That's free money. And people get to wound up then on, but how do I trade it? Do I do straddles, do I do triangles, do I do futures. And honestly, at the point you found that dislocation, you can do about a million things and you'll make money. So the point is finding that standout situation. That's where good trades come from.

Well, I think it's the difference between descriptive and predictive. Like when the VIX does that in the SP doesn't, it's pretty easy to come up with some story for what's going on and you're probably right. Right. It's probably a vol liquidation event. It's probably a lot of people will be person, trouble to trouble and they had to blast out of their VIX position or their SP options. Because otherwise the SP would have gone down quite a bit for the VIX to do that. On the other hand, going forward. Oh, what? Like how do I trade on that? And that's where the difficult it is. And I think. I think there's a tendency for people to things right people have stories. And so they always like to put a reason on top of an observation. And in this case that that reason is probably right. But it doesn't mean anything. It's kind of like, you know, you see the analysts on NFL Sunday, right? They know a lot about football.

So let's say you've done some back tests, right? And you've done all the good stuff and you haven't done overfitting and you haven't got the free parameters. And you've just, I don't know, let's say the back test is I'm going to sell ESMP zero DTE options on the open every day. I'm going to sell the trend. And you look at four years of data. You've got a thousand data points and you see the PL distribution. Like, right, it's a great trade. I have an edge or at least I had an edge in the past. I'm going to do that trade. And then you do that trade for a month. And because I keep telling people they should keep records, see what's going on, try to learn. What they do and this is completely understandable is at the end of that month, I'll say, well, I've learned. I've just trade on a Thursday into half an hour after the opening. And I don't know. Don't do it after two o'clock in the afternoon. But they've now essentially come up with a trading strategy based on 20 observations. That's got three free parameters in it. Right. And they're original. One was so much better and had a thousand observations and no overfitting. And they just absolutely decimated",

And because you've added three parameters, you're now going to need like a thousand divided by square root of three observations. Times square root of three observations to have the same statistical evidence as your original system. So learning like that is a terrible idea. You know, keeping records is really important. Doing trades is really important because I will tell you about execution. And it will tell you about intra trade volatility. And I'll tell you about adverse selection.

And then in this case, we have an observation that is abnormal, but now the reason does matter. I fully, by the way, agree with you and I follow your logic. But how would you lead a basic trader to reconcile those two instances? Well, I think the VIX thing. The single observation that the VIX went up when the SP didn't. It helped me. But if I'm watching the VIX and I say, oh my god, the VIX is above the NASDAQ mix, that's a prey. I'm going to know why that's happened. I know that that happened like 2 of the time in the past. And so that's a great opportunity. And it's not dependent on what's going to happen to the VIX in the future because the VIX did this. It's just a straight-mean reversion. That relationship is wrong.

Doesn't really help you because they don't trade on the same degree of liquidity, but it's an observation. Look at the relationship between the VIX and the VIX. There's a very strong relationship between those two. And then they get stretched. That's usually a sign that the VIX itself is the thing that's going to revert back. The VIX is a volatility measure, right? Those are the other money volatility. What's the relationship between those two? What happens when that gets out of line? There's the skew index. And you can get the skew from the risk reversal. What happens when they get out of line? So all those sort of things or even as simple as like, I don't know. The 5-year-10-year yield curve usually behaves like this. And basically all of these things are mean reverting trades, right? I'm saying this relationship is so strong when it gets out of line, it's going to come back. The VIX thing, it's telling you, you know, the VIX is cheap relative to VIX.

The VIX thing, it's telling you, you know, the VIX is cheap relative to VIX. You want to sell VIX options and buy the VIX. That kind of thing. So I think the best way to do it is to look for relationships like that. And I think looking for a single signal to forecast a single thing. Like what does this mean for the VIX going forward? I don't know, that's a difficult question. But what it looks like to me is the VIX versus the NASDAQ VIX is crazy. I couldn't tell you the VIX is crazy. The VIX goes crazy all the time, right? That's not a trade I'd want to do just purely based on that. I think knowing what these relationships are, that's that, and I story about the J, right? That I held the J for a year. You're not picked this up overnight, right? The other sort of valuable things for you to learn. Looking at those things, it's not like overlaying lines on charts. It's actually doing statistics on things that are related. That's a useful thing. So yeah, I can't really remember the second part of the question you asked. No, it's completely okay.

But it opens a follow on question. We know that the world of trading obviously is difficult, multi-variate. And sometimes traders can go through paths where things they might be observing or seeing might not actually represent reality. But we obviously need to see things in order to understand and build these relationships and find distortions for a newer trader that can't really tell the difference between those two. Do you have any ways to help navigate that? Yeah, come up with the simplest thing you can come up with. Like especially people with technical backgrounds like engineers, they try to engineer the market or they try to engineer their system. So they will take the observation, the European option, throw the price. Instead of saying, well, the simplest way to do that is I'm going to sell a straddle every day. They will say, well, what if I sell straddle when the SP's above it's 200 day moving average? Or what if I sell a straddle when the VIX is above this? And they keep adding more and more stuff onto it. And every time they do that, they are taking the risk that they're putting one of the curious, portrait things on.

So they want to take something that works and give them a sharp ratio of one. And they're like, okay, I'm going to work on this until I get to be a sharp ratio of two. That is very tempting, but it's the wrong way to do it. The better way to do it is come up with something completely different. Might also have a sharp ratio of one. And now you're not going to find perfectly anti correlated things, but they don't have to be perfectly anti correlated. You know, instead of just selling zero DCE options on the SPX, maybe sell them on the cues as well, maybe sell them on IWM as well. And people will be like, well, those things are 100 correlated and not. You know, they might only be 80 correlated, 80 and 100 are not the same thing and they really do help.

So I think it's often easier for other people to recognize what you can do. And what you think you can do. Because what you want. What you think your strengths are probably highly correlated with what you want them to be. So yeah, I don't think I really sat down and said, you know what? I'm going to do.

I think it's probably true, but I think part of it is because a lot of the experience is a thing, right? If you're trading some, if you're being trading like, I don't know how long I have now 30 years or something, there's a lot of stuff that I kind of just know because I've been doing it so long. And that matters, but I might not be able to explain it to someone when I'm actually just teaching them the con day one, because I might not even know that I know that. So I think sometimes when you see that the process is simplified, it's because of there's a lot of that complex knowledge behind it that is now implicit rather than explicit. But I do also think you do simplify things because you realize the important things more. Like at the beginning, you have to do your best, you should always do your best, right? At the beginning, you have to really try to be really good at every part of the process because you don't know what the more important parts are. So I definitely think that's a factor as well. So like when I said about hedging, right? And I'm talking about dynamically belting hedging and no one who's not a market maker should be doing this anyway.",

I was talking to someone who was an editor and she said I said there are no good books or professional options traders and she said already right one. And so that was a book basically aimed at market makers, because it was all about dynamically hedging complex positions. So by the way, I don't believe any of that stuff about psychology in that book and I don't really believe a lot of the stuff about sizing in that book either but that's way more what I don't believe about that's way more nuanced. It's really criteria and it's really important in a different way. The second book was like okay I think Nadenberg's got the job right up at a introductory book and then the third book was much more on the on the buy side. It was like quantitative traders for quantitative traders who literally want to positionally trade, but you're not dynamically hedging. So it's a different thing.

    "text": "things that I find interesting with respect to sizing is you go into the concept of continuous Kelly, which is. I actually think is really, really pertinent. People just, you know, viewed in the binary sense. And then also overlaying that with fractional because regular Kelly can be a little bit scary. Are there other optimization models that you think are worth loosely exploring with respect to sizing and risk outside of Kelly? Yeah, I think there are lots because Aaron Brown, who was the risk manager at AQR, finance professor, been around forever, notes everything. He won't say that Kelly is the optimal solution to a problem that no one actually has. And that. What Kelly does is it will maximize your long run. No one really is around for the long run in that sense, right? People really, even if they think in long run terms, they want to have more money in five years than they do now. And Kelly's not going to guarantee you that you can have the best edge in the world. And Kelly might take you 1,000 down to one cent before it goes ballistic and makes tons of money. So I think you have to start with the concept behind Kelly that if you have more edge, you bet bigger. You have more risk. You bet small. You should bet proportional to the size of your account. But there's a lot of other things you've got to sort of overlay on that",

Because especially if you're an institutional trader, that's what you want. Because if you finish down, you're not going to get a bonus and you're probably get fired. So having a probability based model of probability of making money in a certain time. That is a valid thing to look at optimizing as well. And I talk about that in the first book, but I'm like, I called sit brown. The problem with that is as you get close to that time period at the end, we're going to end up taking massive bets. If you just follow his, his rule. So you have to sort of put a whole bunch of caveats on that one as well. And the other thing is you don't want your money to go from a thousand down to one cent. So you have to incorporate some sort of risk control. And Kelly doesn't have that because Kelly's like, look, the risk control is you've asked me to throw your bankroll.

And I read out between those. So I've always got typically 90 of the risk free bit. So that gives you a big upside possibility. But you're not going to lose more than 10. So I'm getting a floor. And I prefer to do that than use fractional Kelly. The guys who used fractional Kelly, it goes back to the blackjack. They they have a hard stop at the end of each trip. You know, they have a bankroll for that trip. So they've always kind of got a risky part and a safe part as well. Everyone always says no one uses full Kelly.

But I'd be very wary of someone who said I don't want to put too much time in. I think most people I know who are good put too much time in. You know, because they're always thinking about it. Probably not always in a really productive way. Yeah, and I imagine that's got to be the case from like a professional side of things. Right? Because it's what you do. I think the path for a lot of retail traders is it's something that they try to do in addition to like a standard profession. So understanding that paradigm. And I know that we're coming up on time here. How would you walk one of those traders on to like a realistic target? Right? Because obviously to your point, they're not going to be able to fit everything exactly how they want and you know continue to do this other stuff. But obviously they're also saying, well, can I do this as like a supplement or can I do this to help me grow? What kind of like realistic guidelines or targets are just ways of thinking about it.

You're pretty much done. That'll be like 15, 20 minutes trading. You know, there's earnings trades like that.
