So there's an exchange going on. And my argument for everybody to get involved in investing is not to not work. What you'll find is as you develop wealth, the concept of not working is actually really not interesting. And it's also tremendously unfulfilling. But most people desire when they say, I can't wait to not work anymore. What they really mean is they can't wait to have a choice. They can't wait to have a choice about when they work, what they work on. Maybe there's elements of a place that you work that you just kind of put up with because you still want to keep your job there because it's stable. But in the ideal world, you wouldn't do those things. It's the rub. That's the problem with working. It's not the work itself. It's when you need money, you are forced to sacrifice more of your autonomy and freedom in order to get the money. However, if you are financially free, you can sustain yourself. You can sustain your family or lifestyle. You then develop voice. One of the best possible examples I can think of in this, again, it's not to get political, it's",

One of the best possible examples I can think of in this, again, it's not to get political, it's just a great recent example during COVID. There were a lot of people in a lot of different jobs that were either forced to get the vaccine or they were going to be out of a job. Whether you want to get the vaccine or not, totally up to you, I honestly don't care at all. The point I'm making is for a lot of people, the decision was essentially being made for them. You either have to get this or you don't work here anymore. There's always repercussions for our choices. It's okay. I don't think there's anything wrong with the company saying you have to get this. It's up to the company. The point I'm making is that when you work anywhere, when you work for anywhere else, you don't control things. It's not up to you.

I think it's important. No, I don't want to get it for X, Y and Z reasons entirely up to the person. You literally unlock your own freedom when you have money.

But they will not make you, they literally will not make you happy. What I try to remind people is if you are happy before you had money, when you have money, it's just an amplifier. Shits way more fun. You get to do way more cool things. You get to help way more people. You get to be really, really generous when you go get your hair cut or when you have a good dinner. Whatever it is, you get to be generous. That's super fun. But the way that you get to that is by having not only base level needs, but abundance. And that's why I preach to everybody that you should seek abundance because abundance alleviates all of these things. The way that you get to abundance for the vast majority of people out there is through investing. I used to work at Deloitte. It's a management consulting firm. We used to spend a lot of time analyzing and working on compensation packages for companies for clients. The way that clients, companies, very smartly build compensation packages, they do not want things to be too good so that you don't have to work.

You're going to pay on your W2 income no matter what you do no matter what your tax bracket is you're going to pay. That's the downside of W2. Now the pro to W2 is it's stable.

What's the downside to starting your own business? It's a ton of work. Again, not saying it's bad. Just talking about it objectively. It's a ton of work. And you still are going to have clients of some sort. You're going to have counterparties B2B. You're going to have customers you sell to B2C. And you're going to have to tap dance. You're still going to have to play the game if you're a business. You can make way more, you can make",

You're still going to have to play the game if you're a business. You can make way more, you can make tons of money in business if you start a great start-up. Those are also statistical phenomenons. If you think of every successful start-up, there are dozens and dozens and dozens of failures that just didn't make it. Doesn't mean that they're not smart. A bunch of them are super smart. They just didn't time it just right. And they got edged out for one reason or another. Investing is accessible, unilaterally, to everybody. There's no mispricing. There's no somebody having a better relationship rubbing shoulders with somebody else that gets a better deal than you. You have access to the same stuff I do. So investing should be deployed, in my opinion, by everybody. Now whether you choose to become an active derivatives trader, tons of routes you can go. This line is you have to invest. And I hope that that point is abundantly clear. Next thing. This is a general overview of what I consider to be the three levers to building wealth. The first lever is saving.

You can't invest no money. So you need to save first. Now that being said, you cannot save your way to wealth. If I work a standard job like I showed you here, that's my median income. You add taxes on top of that. You add cost of living expenses and things like that. That's not a whole lot left over. I don't know what it is. It kind of depends on where you are. But it's not a whole lot left over that you have disposable income on a monthly basis. If you save that residual disposable income for the rest of the remaining time you possibly can, this won't get you too wealthy. It simply will not get you too wealthy. Now let's take a look at a couple examples of this to hopefully help drive this point home and then introduce the concept of compound interest. This is a calculator from my website. Everybody has access to it. It's for free. Go over here to resources compound interest calculator. Let's say that you're starting with zero dollar. Let's say that you're starting with a dollar.

You have mail, not just kidding, you have 180,000 at the end of your 30 years. This is the process of trying to save your way to wealth. I'm going to be a good saver. I'm going to save as much of my income as I can. It's on average 500 bucks. I do that for 30 years. I essentially have absolutely nothing to show for it. That's the reality here. So this is why we need to invest. Investing is when we turn this zero into a number. It can be the standard market return of eight-ish percent. If I do a standard market return of eight-ish percent, starting at 100, saving 500 a month for 30 years, rather than 180,000, and now I have 680,000.

But I throw it in here for general understanding. Investing is simply typically longer term in nature. Investing is simply shorter term in nature. And gambling is two different things. Technically speaking, gambling in terms of a definition absolutely is trading investing. When we're putting up money with the expectation of some sort of return, that is gambling, that applies to both of these. Now there's the common parlance use that's a little bit different. The main difference from gambling compared to something like trading or investing is that in common parlance, we would associate gambling more so with entertainment or something that has binary end outcomes. A little bit different than what you'll find in non discrete outcome style markets. So the discussion between is trading gambling, is investing gambling from a pure definition standpoint. There are mere images of one another. It's essentially the same concept. But the way that we use the terms very, very different. So just something to be generally aware of. It doesn't really mean anything. This is my approach to trading. We skip over this. And this stuff we'll talk about a little bit later. We're going to get",

We skip over this. And this stuff we'll talk about a little bit later. We're going to get into now quick overview of the markets. So the reason why I do this is so that we understand where things are, how things fit, what we do, who's playing the game with us, those kinds of things. So you can see there are a group of participants and their different nomenclature, their names. So the sell side are typically liquidity providers of some sort. So those will be exchanges, market makers, brokers, IB, stuff like that. Byside generally asset managers, us on the retail side. This is in in generality. You can absolutely find retail that is on the sell side. It's just not our primary bread and butter. The way to think about Byside sell side is who's providing liquidity, who's consuming liquidity. One of the idea. And then there's buy and sell side folks that play both sides for securities. These are the things these are the products as I often refer to them as, but technically products isn't the correct term because products is something that's built in packaged and used for something. So spy is a product. Somebody built that packaged it. It's an ETF or consumption of some sort. But all of these different",

Somebody built that packaged it. It's an ETF or consumption of some sort. But all of these different things that we typically trade, the correct term is securities. So securities are things like equities, derivatives, debt, and there's all different kinds of hybrids with a lot of these. So for example, derivatives is not limited to options and futures. That is not limited to bonds and notes. These are to give you just a general overview of what these things are, what they tend to look like. And then there's exchanges. So there's actually the Chicago that should be on here. It doesn't really matter. This just gives a list of some common exchanges that operate and then there's the OCC from an options trading perspective. We care about the OCC because they clear everybody's trades. So this is the world as we end to see it as retail traders. Retail traders are a very small portion of this whole ecosystem. We're tiny. Now all together, we're not an insignificant portion by any means. We definitely have a share of the market. But most of the money that's moving, most of the trades that are being done are going to be done by these larger entities. So that's that. Let's talk quick about why we trade options. The",

The basis for this, for everybody, is options in my opinion provide these benefits that are different than if you're trading things like equities options grant you leverage. Now I want to be clear, take a step back. Equities can have elements of these options universally have all of them, a little bit different. So you can use them for leverage. You can use them to increase your risk, reduce your risk via hedging. You can trade literally all market directions with options. You cannot do that with equities. If a market is trending sideways in a really tight range bound style movement, there's no stock trading strategy that you can use to monetize that. That's not the case with options. You absolutely can. You have direct access to volatility as a standalone asset class. Big deal. You also can access things like structural alpha. So alpha is sources of baked in inherent edge that we can find throughout the marketplace. A great example of this is variance risk premiums.

That's generally the case, especially for index options. We know this because index options are often used by large institutions to hedge their total risk. So for somebody to step in front and to sell that risk, somebody needs to offer that risk out. The people that choose to offer that risk know that we're stepping in front of a moving train sooner or later, it's going to hit us. So we need to make enough money in the aggregate so that when it eventually hits us, we can still survive and still continue to do business. So there's a premium associated with that. That kind of thing. The other really cool thing about options is you can both trade them directly for income or use them to enhance a standard equity holding, which is really, really neat. So what I mean by that is if we want to trade them directly for income, I can have either certain strategies that are really based not on massive price appreciation, but collecting money up front. And then simply churning on those or I can use a standard stock holding position that I might have built already that I want to have that I want to maintain for a long term investment.

So when people are talking about options leading the markets and stuff like that, there's some efficacy behind it.

Every single option, buyer, seller, buyer has the right to do something. Seller has an obligation. That's why we collect money upfront. Think of it if you're selling something on Facebook Marketplace. If I'm selling something, I have an obligation to deliver the thing I'm selling. I'm going to get money for it. Same thing in options. Now, options have a few key components as outlined here. And this just gives you a quick way to understand how the value of options change based on whether or not they are a call or a put. Those are the two kinds of options that we deal with primarily. Calls appreciate in value as the underlying goes up. We can buy or sell either of them to open a trade. Basics, basics, basics. There are a bunch of different theoretical pricing models that we can use for options. And it's actually really, really good to tinker with them, get familiar with them.

And if their pricing is off terribly, smart institutions, high frequency trading firms and stuff like that will come in and poach those prices and play them against each other. So there's literally baked in incentives for them to price correctly. Now there's a lot of different games that they can play. There's a lot of spoofing, layering, all those kinds of things. But that gets into much more advanced market mechanics. In a nutshell, they're incentivized to price generally correctly. They're obviously going to price in a little bit of an edge for themselves. That's how they make their money. But it's going to be priced generally correctly. But you can tinker with all different kinds of pricing models. You can look at Blackshold Merton.

That's kind of the standard options pricing model that we use by no meal trees and so on and so forth. The main thing you have to know about an options pricing model is that all of the inputs except one are known. We have all these different inputs. We need to know what the underlying price is trading at. We need to know the type of option, whether it's a color put, we need to know the strike price, DTE, risk-free rate, dividend yield, all of that is known. All of that is known. The one thing that is unknown is this one in yellow volatility. This is where money is made in forecasting price with respect to options. For people that say options are overpriced underpriced, this is what they're referring to. They're simply saying volatility is overpriced. Volatility is underpriced because that's the only unknown variable when we're looking at an options price. Things trade in contracts or lots and generally they represent 100 shares. There are minis. I don't really see minis around that much anymore, but minis used to be a tenth of the size, but I don't really see them anymore. I think the liquidity in them just was not good. There are two primary classes of options. There's more than this. There's permuting in options and stuff",

There are two primary classes of options. There's more than this. There's permuting in options and stuff like that, but the two primary ones that we operate with are American and European. This differentiates only by the settlement, potential, or the options. American options can be exercised or assigned at any time, whenever you feel like it, whether it makes sense, whether it doesn't make sense, it doesn't matter. European options can only be exercised at expiration. Very, very important note because the way that you price those options is different because early exercise is a risk. There's a different pricing approach when you calculate things like early assignment and bake that into the model. There are a few primary ways we can close a position. We simply do the inverse of what we did when we opened it. This is the most common. This is if I bought to open an option, I would sell to close. If I sell to open an option, I would buy to close. Not at it. You can also settle by exercising if you were the option buyer. In general, it does not make sense to exercise.

Extrinsic value has two primary inputs. It has time value and volatility. When we think about extrinsic value, you can see this option here back on, what is this? 4 June 2024. It had seven days to go. That option is going to have a certain amount of time value because there's seven days to go. That time value is going to be different than the one that has six days to go. Different than the one that has five days to go and so on and so forth. Volatility is the expected move of something. How much do we think something is going to move?

And then there's realized or historic volatility, which again, we use those interchangeably, but there are differences between them. So and I have videos that go over all of that stuff, but implied volatility is the annualized expected one-student deviation move. And then you can look at volatility for different time frames, which will give you the expected move for a relevant time frame. So an example of this is we have T triple Q's upgrade. So if we go in here to T triple Q's, we can see that there's volatility for all these different time frames. The volatility for all these different time frames is relevant to the time frame. So then instead of annualizing it across a year, it's essentially trying to say over this 43 day time span, how much do I think the underlying is going to move? That's the general approach that it's trying to take there. Then we have realized volatility, which is backwards looking historic volatility and realized volatility are calculated slightly differently. Not a topic for this.

In general, you will see them referred to about the same, but there is a difference. I have a video again that goes through all about vol. You should just know that there's a slight difference between them. Then we have two different ways to evaluate volatility against itself. We often use IV rank or IV percentile. Again, there's differences in how those are calculated. In general, implied volatility percentile is my preferred methodology because it's more representative of what the underlying is doing and it's less skew-grown. Again, I have a video about that as well. You can check out at your leisure, but let's see if we can find an example really quick, just at a curiosity. There's a bunch of stuff that is had this is here we go. Great example. So we can see that the current implied volatility in T-triple cues is 62. The implied volatility percentile is 65. The implied volatility rank is only 26.6. You might look at the IVR and say, wow, vol's really low. But then if you look at the IVP, you're saying damn, vol's pretty damn high. It's a difference in calculation. The thing to note is that implied volatility rank is very prone to skew. It's going to use a high for the last year.

Why implied volatility rank is very, very likely to show a skewed number, especially if there's been large moves in the recent past. You'll find a lot of instances where they're about the same close to one another and that's just if there's no skew. So just another fun fact for you to be aware of. We care a lot about volatility in trading options. We already literally went over this. So look at us go crushing it, looking at implied volatility percentile versus implied volatility rank.

I mostly just want to see if anything that we talked about was like, whoa, what was that? Don't understand that concept. That's what this time's for. Otherwise, we'll keep it pushing and then we'll turn over to the quiz. Reese says in your fall video, you mentioned toss labels, IVR correctly. Is that still the case? Yeah, almost positive. I'll double check real quick, but almost positive. So if the data is displayed, that implied volatility percentile as toss is about to show, I think in today's option statistics, if it says 26.6, then it's actually still showing us rank. Let's take a look. Yep. So this is showing IV percentile is 27, which is 26.6 rounded. So it is still incorrect. They've known that forever. They've literally just for some reason have opted to not change it. It doesn't really matter to me because I honestly don't use it. I use my own calculation for stuff, but yeah, for other people, I could be really misleading. Unfortunately, they don't really care. Okay. Time for a quiz. So what I'm going to do for the quiz is I'm going to create a poll for each one. And I need to end the last poll first. And I need to create a poll for you.

That's, this is a little tricky because of the tax limit. Give me one sec. It'll take me a second to do these. Mostly just because of there's a tax limit. It'll be all right. What I'll do is I'll prep the other one so that they'll go a little quicker. And I think we can only do four options, which is good. Cool. All right. So the first question is about to come out. Start your engines. Get ready. And go. First question is I've. So what I'm looking for here is what is the primary function of an exchange? And the reason why you need to know this is because this feeds back into understanding the ecosystem that we are a part of and what we're doing here. You will obviously see some shorthand.

Since you boys are ninja, I'm literally going to start prepping the next one so that we we've got to be fast out here. Reese says buyers and sellers determine price. That's correct. So markets are consensus driven. If I am a market participant and I see something priced in some type of way and I think it's valued richly or too cheaply, I would make a trade based on that. So the reason why exchanges don't set prices is because a big part of what markets do is facilitate price discovery, which is exactly what this is. So whoever answered set stock prices, totally cool.

Which participant acts as a liquidity provider in markets? We have market makers, retail investors, brokers. Which one here would you wager as the most correct answer? Notice how I emphasized a specific word there, most correct answer. Because if we go back to that prior slide that we looked at together, we'll notice an interesting trend. We look at cell side, which we already discussed is liquidity provision. We can see exchanges are on this. We can see brokers are on this.

They absolutely can. They can internalize. There's different things that they can do to actually provide liquidity to the market. But as we go through some of these questions again, they're from chat GPT.

Don't worry because at the end, I have a couple of Eric questions to spice these up a little bit. The ones from chat GPT are standardized questions just to make you feel better than you probably should before your soul gets crushed on an actual question. So just give us a minute here.

It reads what is a disadvantage for retail traders compared to institutional traders. Let's see what you guys think. In the meantime, this house, New York, Celts or water is really good. Big fan. All right. How many do we got 14 votes? That's about right. And pull. And let's see our responses. 16 votes total, 43 say higher transaction costs, 25 say none of the above access to real time data is 18 and then access or ability to trade pre-market. So this one's a shock and blast. This one got you all twisted. You all are currently messed up like a football bat. So let's work through the wrong ones and we will figure out the correct. So what is a disadvantage for retail traders? None, none. Absolutely not none. There's a ton of disadvantages and for retail traders on this list. So the way that we can reason through none of the above being wrong is that retail traders have lots of disadvantages and some of them are on that list. I was just wrong. The next one, access to real time data, real time data is accessible to retail traders. You absolutely have access to that. You can you you have the choice to have access to the same data sources that are publicly available. Now there's non public available information a little bit different. So",

You also have the ability to trade pre-market as a retail trader. You absolutely do. It depends on your broker. You can absolutely use a broker that has access to pre-market data. So moving through process of elimination, as per usual, the bulk of people did get this one right. 43 were correct. It's higher transaction costs. You will always have higher transaction costs. Transaction costs are not the frontline costs that you see. This is one of the things I try to remind traders of all the time. Transaction costs is not the top line commission that you experience. It's the total friction who transact. You're always going to be at the tail end of that on the retail side. I think there is a saying that I've heard going around about this. What was that saying? Oh, yeah, it's get fucked. That's it. That's what's always going to be the case when it comes to transaction costs. So sorry about that. OK, next question. I'm just throwing it in the chat because the responses for the ABCD that Chat you B.T. gave me were just not happening. So this one says, Lauren, great question. Lauren says, what do you mean friction? Friction is an industry term that encompasses the total cost of us",

Lauren says, what do you mean friction? Friction is an industry term that encompasses the total cost of us to make a trade. So for example, when we look at something like placing a trade, you will have an upfront commission. Then you might have regulatory fees if you're trading things like futures. Then you have the bid ask spread. Then you have the fact that your order is probably going to be bundled with other orders to get the best rebates for payment for order flow. So you're not getting the best bill you're getting wrapped in a bunch of these different costs before your trade actually gets executed. So that's the idea. OK, so the next question here is, how does compound interest differ from simple interest? Reese says interest on interest completely correct. Dylan says growth is geometric instead of linear. Yeah. I think that that fits because the other thing to note though on simple interest is that it might not even be fully linear. Depending on if you're looking at just the interest component versus, you know, the total value component. But yeah, I totally understand what you're saying. And then Matthias says interest makes more money. You guys all got that one right. I'm glad I did not slave away trying to plug",

Some of them have the letters still involved. It doesn't matter. Just don't pay attention to the letter. I got lazy. So the next one says which entity clears and guarantees trades in options. Anybody gets this wrong? You're fired. So we have four votes at OCC so far. We have 11 at market maker, which is straight up pissing me off. Broker and exchange are rightfully sitting at zero, which is good. Do not vote for broker exchange. Those are examples of wrong answers. And then hint hint for whoever the six percent is.

Are you the firm that's literally named after this thing? Let's go back to this retail right here. That's you right there. There's literally an entire business sector for high frequency trading firms. And subsidies is actually an interesting one. I'm not going to lie. Okay. So we can end this before I end myself looking at some of these answers and we'll go through them. Yeah. There's only two in here that I would give credit for it. And again, if we're trying to answer this in the standard test taking approach of which one is most correct, then again, Gryffindor get I award Gryffindor no points. So the question was what is an advantage of retail trader smaller position sizes high frequency trading capabilities access to leverage government subsidies? Let's let's go through the the wrong ones. First, I already think high frequency trading capabilities. That's point is already been made access to leverage. So whoever thinks it was access to leverage, let's think back to 2008. Who caused the crisis in 2008?

Is that was it retail who caused that? Because what I can promise you is the entity that did cause that absolutely had access to tons of leverage more leverage than you could fucking wrap your arms around. So it's not that one. Current subsidies is the only other one that I would even consider. But again, I would not consider it if we're trying to answer this in the context of which one is most correct. The only reason, the only reason why I could reasonably think about government subsidies here is that if you elect to be a day trader in market to market, if you make that election, then the government is kind of subsidizing. But it's not a government subsidy. It's a big stretch to make that argument. Like you're not really getting any sort of reward, you're just being able to actually write off what you're doing and you're able to use your full losses in a single year. Like that's it.

So again, it's a big stretch. I could see a tiny sliver of that answer, but hands down the correct answer there is smaller position sizes. The reason why smaller position sizes are so important is because if you want to place max trade size in something like T triple cues, you can if you want to place max trade size in an option on T triple cues, you can you move the market a little bit, but you can. This is why dark pools exist. They sound way more nefarious than they are, but they genuinely are kind of needed because for those that it's it's time we've gotten through. How long we've been going in hour and seven minutes, which fun fact, I really had zero game plan for this session. So I hope it's been good. I created a loose agenda, but I spent exactly zero time thinking about what I was actually going to talk about. So.

Not like that fat. This is like the and they have like little tiny arms, like a little fucking critter. So the broker says, hello, ma'am. How much so? I please rights. They're all proper and lame.

And I'll figure it out with you really quick. So let's go to so fire. And the last volume is 28.7 at 14.55, which is the stock price. 20, 28.71. So let's take a quick look at this. 28, 712, 123. So this is the total volume that it ran. And then let's just call it like 14. I think it was 17 or something, but it was just called it like 1415. Because I'm simple brain.

Markets are down less than half a point. Don't come in here with that nonsense. We're not trying to have a deranged Kathy that he's something down half a point. Anyways, Kathy's aside. This is a problem. This is a problem if you're trying to provide an actual fill at a reasonable price for something. So this is the advent of dark pools, which sound so much more nefarious than they are. Now, I want to be clear. I'm not advocating for against dark pools. I'm really not, but I can objectively analyze their utility. This is one of the things that retail traders honestly suck at is objective analysis of stuff. If something is perceived as being not beneficial to me, Eric, the trader, I don't like it.

Now, one of the things that people do not understand, I see it as a really, really common misunderstanding in the game stop community specifically. So spend a lot of time analyzing game stop and working alongside the apes is. Orders that are filled in a dark pool still hit the consolidated tape. There's still there. There's literally a slight delay typically. It's not even that long of a delay. It's several seconds, not long. So it's still AIDS price discovery. It's still AIDS consensus driven pricing. It's not a significant attractor to any of that stuff. Again, from an objective standpoint, it does absolutely slow price discovery. There's no debate about it. But the price discovery is going to be slowed anyways by people trying to frontrun the order anyways. So it's just a way for larger institutions to be able to transact and actually get full fills on orders without moving the markets on them. So that is that in a nutshell. I don't remember how many",

I don't remember how many questions we've done so far. Let me take a look at what's left. And because I want to make sure that we have at least because we're already we have like 10 minutes left. There's two more questions. Let's run through these two questions really quick. And then we'll get into just general open QA for anything else that that you want to hit. So the next question is what's the main purpose of options? We have speculation, hedging and leverage earnings, earning dividends and none of the above. So all right. We have nine votes. That's plenty, especially because we already had some people going off the beaten path and hedging and leverage. Then none of the above. So for somebody that answered hedging and leverage, why would you disprove or how would you disprove the answer of none of the above. And this next one is actually kind of interesting to be honest. Because we didn't talk about this yet, but chat GPT probably went through my deck because I uploaded it. So it's grabbing this from a little bit later. And I still think it's a completely fine question. So I'm going to ask this one. But",

And I still think it's a completely fine question. So I'm going to ask this one. But I want to get an answer to the last one. So for somebody that answered hedging and leverage, why how would you explain that none of the above is wrong. And while you're explaining that, I'm a I'm a hit up the old the old chat. And I'm going to see if Mel is any dinner preferences because you guys, you have no idea what I did to Thor. I brought him to the groomer today. And whenever I bring him to the groomer, my, my, it's not even a guilty pleasure. It is a completely unshamed shameless, completely shameless pleasure with Thor is I like to have them give him the most ridiculous haircuts. And then poor Mel just has to kind of tolerate it because I, you know, I always maintain the argument. I'm the one that brings them. So I'm the one that gets to tell them what, what to do. So I gave him what I consider to be the piece to La Rizostance like it's a masterpiece. He looks so ridiculous.

So yeah, he looks, he looks ridiculous. It's most excellent. And he says, now we need to see Thor. You will. I'll definitely bring him in before, before we wrap up for sure. A Reese says they're leveraged because they're cheaper than a hundred shares with the same exposure and can be used to offload risk put by. Yeah, I think that's a reasonable simplistic explanation. The reason why none of the above is wrong is because literally the primary purpose of options is to provide hedging. That's the general reason why they were invented and then speculation came up came on after that. So leverage is an element of it, but options can be used to speculate and the reason why we use it to speculate is because it provides things like leverage and options allow you to control a larger sum of money with less money, whether you buy yourself doesn't matter.

But the last question we have is how can a trader mitigate cognitive biases? This one super, super easy. And it's very clear that I'm actually glad because what I did for chat GPT is I uploaded the that big ugly PowerPoint deck that I reference when we go through a lot of these. And I had it create a series of quiz questions off of it. So yeah, I really, really like. That it asked that and you guys are correct. It's essentially the way we mitigate cognitive biases first is by being aware of the cognitive bias that really is a big step because it's very difficult to fix problems that you don't that you don't know where you don't acknowledge exist makes it really, really difficult to solve for. And then after that it is the way that we think about things we understand our natural human in eight biases.

Again, this one's more so designed for a recap. So that's mostly what I was trying to hit for it. But as per always, I really am interested in trying to do a good job for you guys. So I would love just your general feedback on what we talked about if it was good. Okay, cool. So generally seems to be okay. And then obviously if you didn't like it, then I then I hate you. And I'm not I don't want to hear about it. So it's really a blank quite obviously I'm joking. If if there's stuff we can do better, I want to know, but I still will hate you and not let go of it pretty much forever. It's just. Okay, so now let's move into open QA.

James says when someone says something as an IV of XYZ does that always have an expiration attached to it by default negative. That's a great question. So in general, when people are referring to the IV of a ticker, they're typically referring to the ticker for the underlying itself, which that is an annualized deviation. So what that means is let me get rid of this drawing tool. It messes up some of the other commands that will don't want that. There we go. So if somebody says, for example, so fly as an implied volatility of 78.6 that's an annualized expected deviation, one standard deviation move. So that's for the underlying itself. Then when we're talking about individual explorations, that's when we're talking about expiration.

Yeah, there's I think that's a great foundational book, but front running is a really flexible concept that genuinely applies to a ton of things because the concept of front running is just where we for whatever reason are able to navigate in front of something before a move then happens.

I thought he made it through like his pet smart or whatever the company here in. Let's see, how did Cohen make his money. He began his career working as a trader for gruntle and co, which I know",

What I'm doing for this is you guys know for the live streams. I'm actually opening up a text doc so that I can take really loose timestamps for people when they want to rewatch things. I'm not like doing each item or anything like that. But yeah, I'm trying to make it easier for you guys to rewatch through stuff. So let's take a look at our homework.

That's freaky. We're gonna go here because apparently it's like a really cool winter town. That's the word on the show. So yeah, we're gonna go check out this place and that'll be a little bit later this month. It looks kind of cool. So that's that. Let's get back to this. Resets jobs tomorrow morning with Outlooking. I can't remember CPI, PPI, our employment. Yeah, there's a couple things. So there's nothing in here that's really sticking out to me. Let's run through the actual calendar. Let's see what that is. The tent. We have OPEC building permits. CPI CPI will be a pretty big deal. Michigan sentiment. That'll be a big deal too. That balance sheet. So tomorrow will actually be a little bit busy, I think. I'm already all. Wow. RGTI down 45. Wow, I didn't realize they got cracked that hard. Cubits down 43. Ioncute on 39 QBTS down 36. Holy shit. So those ones we're going to need a bunch of alerts on.
