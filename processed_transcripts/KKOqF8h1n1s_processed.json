And when you work for somebody, you are exchanging your most valuable resources for less valuable, but very important resource. You're exchanging your time, your health, your well-being, your effort. That's what you are providing your expertise and you're receiving money for that. Then you can go do things with the money. So there's an exchange going on. And my argument for everybody to get involved in investing is not to not work. What you'll find is as you develop wealth, the concept of not working is actually really not interesting. And it's also tremendously unfulfilling. What most people desire when they say, I can't wait to not work anymore. What they really mean is they can't wait to have a choice. They can't wait to have a choice about when they work, what they work on. Maybe there's elements of a place that you work that you just kind of put up with because you still want to keep your job there because it's stable. But in the ideal world, you wouldn't do those things. That's the rub. That's the problem with working. It's not the work itself. It's when you need money, you are forced to sacrifice more of your autonomy and freedom",

However, if you are financially free, you can sustain yourself, you can sustain your family or lifestyle, you then develop voice. One of the best possible examples I can think of in this again, is not to get political, it's just a great recent example during COVID. There were a lot of people in a lot of different jobs that were either forced to get the vaccine or they were going to be out of a job. Whether you want to get the vaccine or not, totally up to you, I honestly don't care at all. The point I'm making is for a lot of people, the decision was essentially being made for them. You either have to get this or you don't work here anymore. There's always repercussions for our choices. It's okay. I don't think there's anything wrong with the company saying you have to get this. It's up to the company. The point I'm making is that when you work anywhere, when you work for anywhere else, you don't control things. It's not up to you.

The downside to that is then you either you have to make a real hard choice. And if you have a family, maybe you're the sole breadwinner, and you're essentially met between two things in the middle of COVID, either I have to get this vaccine in order to stay at the job or I need to leave the job voluntarily or get fired and then try to find another job in a current job market which is really, really challenging. Again, there's still a choice there. The point I'm making is that there's a lot of pressure and that's purely alleviated. Imagine if that person was financially free. Then that person could objectively choose whether or not they want to get it completely on their own. They're choice. Yes, I want to get it. I think it's the right thing. I'm a first responder.

It's not just having money for the sake of having excess, you'll be able to buy a bunch of materialistic things because again, materialistic things are fun. I'm completely honest about that. But they will not make you, they literally will not make you happy. What I try to remind people is if you are happy before you had money, when you have money, it's just an amplifier. Shits way more fun. You get to do way more cool things. You get to help way more people. You get to be really, really generous when you go get your hair cut or when you have a good dinner. Like whatever it is. You get to be generous. That's super fun. But the way that you get to that is by having not only base level needs, but abundance. And that's why I preach to everybody that you should seek abundance because abundance alleviates all of these things.

They do not want things to be too good so that you don't have to work.

If I pay you a bunch of money, if I pay you too much money, they can afford it. But if I pay you too much money, then I don't really retain you. What they're looking to do is capitalize on a curve. They want to pay you just enough. Just enough. Keep you. So that the friction of changing jobs is just enough that you're like, do I want to go through the process of updating my resume?

That's what they try to price you at. So I bring that to your attention because from a compensation standpoint, companies are not incentivized to pay you a lot. They're incentivized to pay you just enough. Add on to that the reality again in the US of W2 income. W2 income is the sloppiest kind of income you can come across. It's good to have, you should have income. When I say sloppiest, it is that that's the first tax bucket everybody gets to go into. And you're going to pay. You're going to pay on your W2 income no matter what you do no matter what your tax bracket is. You're going to pay. That's the downside of W2. Now the pro to W2 is it's stable. Somebody else is taking the risk. You just work for them. They're taking all the risk. They set up all the infrastructure. So I want to be clear. I'm not sitting here complaining about the structure.

The first lever is saving. Your ability to save directly feeds into your ability to do everything else. You can't invest no money. So you need to save first. Now that being said, you cannot save your way to wealth. If I work a standard job like I showed you here, that's my median income. You add taxes on top of that. You add cost of living expenses and things like that. That's not a whole lot left over. Don't know what it is. It kind of depends on where you are. But it's not a whole lot left over that you have disposable income on a monthly basis. If you save that residual disposable income for the rest of the remaining time you possibly can, this won't get you too wealthy. It simply will not get you too wealthy.

Let's say you're starting with a dollar. You got, I guess minimums of 100 on this calculator. So you got a hundred bucks. And let's say, I don't know what the minimum return is. Can you do zero? Zero percent return. Great. So you start with the hundred bucks. And let's say that you have 500 to suppose will income on a monthly basis, which is probably on the high side for some people. Let's do that over 30 years. You have mail. No, I'm just kidding. You have 180,000 at the end of your 30 years. This is the process of trying to save your way to wealth. I'm going to be a good saver. I'm going to save as much of my income as I can. It's on average, 500. If I do that for 30 years, I essentially have absolutely nothing to show for it. That's the reality here.

It's just again an objective fact. So we need to save that creates the basis for investing. Then we need to actually invest the money that we're saving. Then the third step is to grow your income and you have more choices at that now than ever before. There's all sorts of digital manners that you can look to expand your income. The reason why we need to expand our income is because you can only cut so many costs. You can only cut so many things before you get down to bare bones, what you need to live.

And this talks a little bit about the difference between investing, trading and gambling. And this is a conversation that you'll come across for lots of people that are honestly is pretty pedantic. But I throw it in here for general understanding. Investing is simply typically longer term in nature. Trading is simply shorter term in nature. And gambling is two different things. Technically speaking, gambling in terms of a definition absolutely is trading investing. When we're putting up money with the expectation of some sort of return that is gambling that applies to both of these. Now there's the common parlance use that's a little bit different. And the main difference from gambling compared to something like trading or investing is that in common parlance, we would associate gambling more so with entertainment. Or something that has binary and outcomes. A little bit different than what you'll find in non discrete outcome style markets. So the discussion between is trading gambling is investing gambling from up here definition standpoint. There are mere images",

Doesn't really mean anything. This is my approach to trading. We skip over this. And this stuff will talk about a little bit later. We're going to get into now quick overview of the markets. The reason why I do this is so that we understand where things are, how things fit, what we do, who's playing the game with us, those kinds of things. So you can see there are a group of participants and their different nomenclature, their names. So the sell side are typically liquidity providers of some sort. So those will be exchanges, market makers, brokers, IB, stuff like that. Byside, generally asset managers, us on the retail side. This is in in generality. You can absolutely find retail that is on the sell side. It's just not our primary bread and butter. The way to think about Byside sell side is who's providing liquidity, who's consuming liquidity.

These are the things these are the products as I often refer to them as, but technically products isn't the correct term. Because products is something that's built in packaged and used for something. So spy is a product. Somebody built that packaged it. It's an ETF for consumption of some sort. But all of these different things that we typically trade, the correct term is securities. So securities are things like equities, derivatives, debt. And there's all different kinds of hybrids with a lot of these. So for example, derivatives is not limited to options and futures. That is not limited to bonds and notes.

Now, altogether, we're not an insignificant portion by any means. We definitely have a share of the market. But most of the money that's moving, most of the trades that are being done, are going to be done by these larger entities. So that's that. Let's talk quick about why we trade options. The basis for this for everybody is options in my opinion provide these benefits that are different. Then if you're trading things like equities options grant you leverage. Now I want to be clear, take a step back. Equities can have elements of these options universally have all of them. A little bit different. So you can use them for leverage. You can use them to increase your risk, reduce your risk via hedging. You can trade literally all market directions with options. You cannot do that with equities. If a market is trending sideways in a really tight range bound style movement, there's no stock trading strategy that you can use to monetize that. That's not the case with options.

Sources of baked in inherent edge that we can find throughout the marketplace. A great example of this is variance risk premiums. We know that puts tend to be priced more expensively than calls. That's generally the case especially for index options. We know this because index options are often used by large institutions who hedge their total risk. So for somebody to step in front and to sell that risk, somebody needs to, somebody needs to offer that risk out. The people that choose to offer that risk know that we're stepping in front of a moving train. Sooner or later, it's going to hit us. So we need to make enough money in the aggregate so that when it eventually hits us, we can still survive and still continue to do business. So there's a premium associated with that.

The beauty of that is conversely to options unless it pays a dividend and the dividend is enough, you have to start unwinding some of the stock position.

When people are talking about options leading the markets and stuff like that, there's some efficacy behind it, however, not total efficacy, because you need an underlying asset to price a derivative off of. There can be relationships, but there's still tied to an underlying asset. There are two parties, every single option, buyer, seller. Buyer has the right to do something. Seller has an obligation. That's why we collect money upfront. Think of it if you're selling something on Facebook Marketplace. If I'm selling something, I have an obligation to deliver the thing I'm selling. I'm going to get money for it. Same thing in options. Now, options have a few key components as outlined here. This just gives you a quick way to understand how the value of options change based on whether or not they are a call or a put. Those are the two kinds of options that we deal with primarily. Calls appreciate in value as the underlying goes up. What's appreciate and value as the underlying goes down. We can buy or sell either",

There are a bunch of different theoretical pricing models that we can use for options. It's actually really, really good to tinker with them, get familiar with them. The punchline is options for the vast majority of retail traders. They're going to be priced through market consensus. They're going to be priced through market makers. These are going to be entities that are going to value what they think the option should be traded at. They're going to offer a quote bid and offer to buy or sell depending on the ticker, depending on their book, but most of them will offer both sides. If their pricing is off terribly, smart institutions, high frequency trading firms and stuff like that will come in and poach those prices and play them against each other.

That's how they make their money. But it's going to be priced generally correctly. But you can tinker with all different kinds of pricing models. You can look at Blackshold Merton. That's kind of the standard options pricing model that we use by no meal trees and so on and so forth. The main thing you have to know about an options pricing model is that all of the inputs except one are known. We have all these different inputs. We need to know what the underlying price is trading at. We need to know the type of option, whether it's a color put, we need to know the strike price DTE, risk free rate, dividend yield. All of that is known. All of that is known. The one thing that is unknown is this one in yellow volatility. This is where money is made in forecasting price with respect to options for people that say options are overpriced underpriced. This is what they're referring to. They're simply saying volatility is overpriced. Volatility is underpriced because that's the only unknown variable when we're looking at an options price options trade in contracts or lots.",

Generally, they represent 100 shares. There are minis. I don't really see minis around that much anymore, but minis used to be a tenth the size. I don't really see them anymore. I think the liquidity in them just was not good. There are two primary classes of options. There's more than this. There's permuting and options and stuff like that. But the two primary ones that we operate with are American and European. This differentiates only by the settlement potential for the options. So American options can be exercised or assigned at any time, whenever you feel like it, whether it makes sense, whether it doesn't make sense, doesn't matter. European options can only be exercised at expiration. Very, very important note because the way that you price those options is different because early exercise is a risk. So there's a different pricing approach when you calculate things like early assignment and bake that into the model. There are a few primary ways we can close a position. We simply do the inverse of what we did when we opened it. This is the most common. So this is if I bought to open an option, I would sell",

In general, it does not make sense to exercise. The reason why it doesn't make sense to exercise is because you for go the remaining extrinsic value that you can otherwise capture if you sell the option. That's the primary reason why really exercise is inherently disincentivized. So. And then the last methodology is if an option expires worthless. If you take it all the way in expiration and it's out of the money, it will expire worthless. Moneyness will be coming up. I think next. There it is. So this looks at an options chain and you can run through this just for your own reference left hand side calls right hand side puts. You can see what is out of the money at the money in the money.

So you can see that for calls an option is in the money when the option strike is less than the current value. And then you can obviously run the derivative permutations for out of the money for both calls and puts from there. An option has to primary components to its value. It has intrinsic and extrinsic value. Extrinsic value has to primary inputs. It is time value and volatility. So when we think about extrinsic value. You can see this option here back on what is this for June 2024. It had seven days to go. So that option is going to have a certain amount of time value because there's seven days to go that time value is going to be different than the one that has six days to go different than the one that has five days to go and so on and so forth.

And if I think it's going to move very little. So that's an option chain overview volatility. We already went over some of this. But the sake of options traders. There's kind of two primary types of volatility that you're concerned with. You're concerned with implied volatility, which is a forward looking forecast. And then there's realized or historic volatility, which again, we use those interchangeably, but there are differences between them. So and I have videos that go over all of that stuff. But implied volatility is the annualized expected one student deviation move. And then you can look at volatility for different time frames, which will give you the expected move for a relevant time frame. So an example of this is we have T triple cues upgrade. So if we go in here to T triple cues, we can see that there's volatility for all these different time frames. The volatility for all these different time frames is relevant to the time frame.

That's the general approach that it's trying to take there. Then we have realized volatility, which is backwards looking historic volatility and realize volatility are calculated slightly differently. Not a topic for this. In general, you will see them referred to about the same, but there is a difference. I have a video again that goes through all about vol. You should just know that there's a slight difference between them. Then we have two different ways to evaluate volatility against itself. We often use IV rank or IV percentile. Again, there's differences in how those are calculated. In general, implied volatility percentile is my preferred methodology because it's more representative of what the underlying is doing and it's less skew from again. I have a video about that as well. You can check out at your leisure, but let's see if we can find an example really quick. Just out of curiosity. There's a bunch of stuff that is had this is here we go. Great, great example. We can see that the current implied volatility in T triple Qs is 62. The implied volatility percentile 65. The implied volatility rank",

We can see that the current implied volatility in T triple Qs is 62. The implied volatility percentile 65. The implied volatility rank is only 26.6. You might look at the IV R and say, wow, vol is really low. But then if you look at the IV P, you're saying damn, vol is pretty damn high. It's a difference in calculation. The thing to note is that implied volatility rank is very prone to skew. It's going to use a high for the last year. Wherever volatility jacks up at some point, that's now involved in that calculation until that data input rolls off after enough days pass and that data point falls off the end. That's why implied volatility rank is very, very likely to show a skewed number, especially if there's been large moves in the recent past. You'll find a lot of instances where they're about the same close to one another and that's just if there's no skew. So just another fun fact for you to be aware of. We care a lot about volatility in trading options. We already literally went over this. So look at us go crushing it, looking at implied volatility percentile versus implied volatility rank.

Now don't worry because towards the end of the session, I'm going to have time for QA where we can run through everything. I mostly just want to see if anything that we talked about was like, well, what was that? Don't understand that concept. That's what this time's for. Otherwise, we'll keep it pushing and then we'll turn over to the quiz. RIS says in your fall video, you mentioned toss labels, IVR correctly. That's still the case. Yeah, almost positive. I'll double check real quick, but almost positive. So if the if the data is displayed that implied volatility percentile as toss is about to show, I think in today's options statistics. If it says 26.6, then it's actually still showing us rank. Let's take a look. Yep. So this is showing IV percentile is 27, which is 26.6 rounded. So it is still incorrect. They've known that forever.

Reese says buyers and sellers determine price. That's correct. So markets are consensus driven.

We look at sell side, which we already discussed is liquidity provision. We can see exchanges are on this. We can see brokers are on this. We can see market makers are on this and we can see IBs are on this. Technically, you can see you could argue either of these as well. But the primary provider of liquidity is a market maker. That's their primary job. Now brokers can provide liquidity. They absolutely can. They can internalize. There's different things that they can do to actually provide liquidity to the market. But as we go through some of these questions again, they're from chat GPT. But second, you just pick the one that is most correct. And definitely that the most correct answer out of that one would be market makers. Because that genuinely is the entire function of a market maker. It's what they're meant to do.

The next question is which of the following is a derivative. Whoever picks stock for the love of God change your answer. Whoever picked ETF for the love of God change your answer is be correct. Don't pick those. Do not pick those. We have 88 say call option. We have 6 to say stocks 6 to ETF. We'll call those as misclicks every once in a while. That's probably somebody that's driving will give you the benefit of the doubt there. You were going somewhere and you just you misclicked happens to the best of us.

It reads what is a disadvantage for retail traders compared to institutional traders. Let's see what you guys think. In the meantime, this house New York, Celts or water is really good. Big fan. All right. How many do we got 14 votes? That's about right and pull. And let's see our responses.

This one got you all twisted. You all are currently messed up like a football bat. So let's work through the wrong ones and we will figure out the correct. So what is a disadvantage for retail traders not none. Absolutely not none. There's a ton of disadvantages and for retail traders on this list.

Access to real time data. Real time data is accessible to retail traders. You absolutely have access to that. You can you you have the choice to have access to the same data sources that are publicly available. Now there's non public available information a little bit different. So in terms of real time data you have access to it that does not mean that you have the fastest or optimal access to data for that you do not. But you do have access to real time data.

I'm just going to ask this next one to you guys because it's too difficult to try and to try and give you the answer. But let's run through the rest of these though ability to trade pre market. You also have the ability to trade pre market as a retail trader. You absolutely do depends on your broker. You can absolutely use a broker that has access to pre market data. So moving through process of elimination as per usual, the bulk of people did get this one right 43 were correct. It's higher transaction costs. You will always have higher transaction costs. Transaction costs are not are not the frontline costs that you see. This is one of the things I try to remind traders of all the time transaction cost is not the top line commission that you experience. It's the total friction who transact. You're always going to be at the tail end of that on the retail side. The I think there is a saying that I've heard going around about this. What was that saying? Oh, yeah, it's get fucked.

I'm just throwing it in the chat because the the responses for the ABCD that chat you gave me were just not happening. So this one says. Lauren, great question. Lauren says, what do you mean friction? Friction is an industry term that encompasses the total cost of us to make a trade. So for example, when we look at something like placing a trade, you will have an upfront commission. Then you might have regulatory fees if you're trading things like futures. Then you have the bid ask spread. Then you have the fact that your order is probably going to be bundled with other orders to get the best rebates for payment for order flow. So you're not getting the best bill. You're getting wrapped in a bunch of these different costs before you trade actually gets executed. So that's the idea. Okay, so the next question here is.

And then Matthias says interest makes more money. You guys all got that one right. I'm glad I did not slave away trying to plug that into the poll function, which is a little bit annoying. Okay, perfect. You guys know the answer to this one. Because we went over most of these. That's also the thing that will piss me off the most is if we get a bunch of these wrong, it'll make me mad because we win over specifically all of these. And this one. Some of them have the letters still involved. It doesn't matter. Just don't pay attention to the letter. I got lazy. So the next one says which entity clears and guarantees trades in options.

Are you the firm that's literally named after this thing? Let's go back to this. Retail right here. That's you right there. There's literally an entire business sector for high frequency trading firms. Government subsidies is actually an interesting one. I'm not going to lie. Okay. So we can end this before I end myself looking at some of these answers. And we'll go through them. Yeah. There's only two in here that I would give credit for it.

First, I already think high frequency trading capabilities. That's point is already been made access to leverage. So whoever thinks it was access to leverage. Let's think back to 2008. Who caused the crisis in 2008? Was it retail traders who were disgustingly over levered in subprime mortgages that they were bundling together into mortgage back securities and trading them amongst one another like an incestuous pool. Is that was it retail who caused that? Because what I can promise you is the entity that did cause that absolutely had access to tons of leverage more leverage than you could fucking wrap your arms around. So it's not that one government subsidies is the only other one that I would even consider. But again, I would not consider it if we're trying to answer this in the context of which one is most correct. The only reason why I could reasonably think about government subsidies here is that if you elect to be a day trader in market to market, if you make that election, then the government is kind of subsidizing. And not a government subsidy like it's a big stretch to",

The only reason why I could reasonably think about government subsidies here is that if you elect to be a day trader in market to market, if you make that election, then the government is kind of subsidizing. And not a government subsidy like it's a big stretch to make that argument. Like you're not really getting any sort of reward. You're just being able to actually write off what you're doing and you're able to use your full losses in a single year. Like that's it. It's not really a subsidy. So again, it's a big stretch. I could see a tiny sliver of that answer. But hands down the correct answer there is smaller position sizes. The reason why smaller position sizes are so important is because if you want to place max trade size and something like T triple cues, you can. If you want to place max trade size in an option on T triple cues, you can you move the market a little bit, but you can. This is why dark pools exist. They sound way more nefarious than they are, but they genuinely are kind of needed.

It's obviously also about my fantastic artwork, but it's about dark pools. And here's what happens. And to get hopefully educational for a second joking aside, if Lauren tried to take this 100 million dollar order and she tried to go to the open market. This 100 million dollar order would represent a significant amount of the actual deal flow of of a day of still five. Let's take a look at an example. Because I actually don't know the answer. And I'll figure it out with you really quick. So let's go to so five. And the last volume is 28.7 at 14.55, which is the stock price 20 28.71. So let's take a quick look at this. 28.71.2.123.

I think it was 17 or something, but let's just call it like 14.15 because I'm simple brain. And let's do the math here this times this it tells us it tells us the total dollar volume that it moved on the day. So this is 406 million dollars. In our example that we just came up with together here. A single entity, a single baller out here named Lauren is trying to move 100 million. It's a fourth of the total volume that this experienced over the course of a day. So here's what happens. If she tries to go to the open market with this at one fourth of the total size. What ends up happening. I just completely messed up spelling total. What ends up happening is as she starts entering her order, right. So she sends 100,000. Then she does another 100,000.

But there is a really, really important need for us to be able to look at something and objectively try to analyze it. So in this context, I can get into this trade and front run the rest of the order flow. If I'm seeing it being bid hit at the offer and bid up over and over again, I can get involved and move with the order flow that I'm expecting to continue to some degree. The purpose of dark pools is Lauren instead can come meet with a few people in this meeting typically happens over the phone and stuff like that. That person has a silly look and face and Lauren simply says, I want to move 100 million. And this person says, OK, well, I'm trying to move 50 mill. This person says I'm trying to move 25 mill and then Lauren's like, OK, well, I'm",

Lauren's like, now I got to fill this whole thing. Then they'll call a friend. Maybe they'll hit up a broker, whatever it is. And they'll find somebody else that's like, OK, well, I could do 25 mill. And what they do is they'll agree on a price. This person will say I'll do it at 1449. This person says I'll do it at because it's less. I'll do it at 1455. And this person says I'll do it at 1448. Whatever it is. And this order then can be filled. Now, one of the things that people do not understand. I see it as a really, really common misunderstanding in the game stop community specifically. Because I spend a lot of time analyzing game stop and working alongside the apes is orders that are filled in a dark pool still hit the consolidated tape. There's still there. There's literally a slight delay typically. It's not even that long of a delay. It's several seconds, not long. So it's still AIDS price discovery. It's still AIDS consensus driven pricing.

Again, from an objective standpoint, it does absolutely slow price discovery. There's no debate about it. But the price discovery is going to be slowed anyways by people trying to front run the order anyways. So it's just a way for larger institutions to be able to transact and actually get full fills on orders without moving the markets on themselves. So that is that in a nutshell. I don't remember how many questions we've done so far. Let me take a look at what's left. And because I want to make sure that we have at least because we're already we have like 10 minutes left. There's two more questions. Let's run through these two questions really quick. And then we'll get into just general open QA or anything else that that you want to hit. So the next question is what's the main purpose of options? We have speculation, hedging and leverage earnings, earning dividends and none of the above. All right. We have nine votes. That's plenty, especially because we already had some people going off the beaten path and hedging and leverage. Then none of the above. So for somebody that's",

Why would you disprove or how would you disprove the answer of none of the above. And then this next one is actually kind of interesting to be honest because we didn't talk about this yet, but chat GPT probably went through my deck because I uploaded it. So it's grabbing this from a little bit later. And I still think it's a completely fine question. So I'm going to ask this one. But I want to get an answer to the last one. So for somebody that answered hedging and leverage. How would you explain that none of the above is wrong? Because obviously none of the above is wrong. And while you're explaining that, I'm a, I'm a hit up the old, the old chat. And I'm going to see if Mel is any dinner preferences because you guys, you have no idea what I did to Thor. I brought him to the groomer today. And whenever I bring him to the groomer, my, my, it's not even a guilty pleasure.

So I, I gave him what I consider to be the piece to live resistance like it's a masterpiece. He looks so ridiculous. So anyways, I'm going to see what Mel wants for dinner versus telling her what I'm going to get because I feel a little bad. I also don't want to end up dead in my sleep tonight. So yeah, he looks, he looks ridiculous. It's most excellent. Lauren says, now we need to see Thor. You will. I'll definitely bring them in before, before we wrap up for sure. A race says they're leveraged because they're cheaper than a hundred shares with the same exposure and can be used to offload risk put by. Yeah, I think that's a reasonable simplistic explanation.

So leverage is an element of it, but options can be used to speculate and the reason why we use it to speculate is because it provides things like leverage and options allow you to control a larger some of money with less money, whether you buy yourself doesn't matter. So that's the question. And then we'll get into the open QA. So for the open QA start thinking about whatever you want to talk about doesn't even have to be related to what we covered tonight. It can be it cannot be. But the last question we have is how can a trader mitigate cognitive biases. This one super, super easy. And it's very clear that I'm actually glad because what I did for chat GPT is I uploaded the that big ugly PowerPoint deck that I reference when we go through a lot of these. I had it create a series of quiz questions off of it. So yeah, I really, really like that it asked that and you guys are correct. It's essentially the way we mitigate cognitive biases.

And beyond that, we can control for it the way we can control for it is then by identifying what it is. So yeah, overall, I hope that the quiz was good for you. Before we get into the open QA, I do have a couple questions for you. The first question I have is how, how was the first session did the material makes sense. Did we move at the correct pace. Was it the right kind of stuff. Again, this one's more so designed for a recap. So that's mostly what I was trying to hit for it.

If there's anything that you specifically want me to discuss, take a look at now is a perfect time to do so you can grab any of your comments from before that I didn't get to. And you can just bump up to the front and then I'll be able to take a peek through it. So let's see what pops out to my eyes. Let me see. Stelio says dumb question, but how does I ex operate different than other exchanges? That's a great question.

Mark says they hit the other exchanges at the same time to prevent front running read flash boys. Yeah, so I mean they do a lot more than that though. So what they do is they use a specific delay. They call it if I'm not mistaken a speed bump. And the whole purpose of a speed bump is to slow down the ability for high for the traders to interact. So a big, a big goal for something like I X is to neutralize some of the methodologies of high for the traders, but they also they don't use any rebates. They really focus on best execution. They're way more transparent. So they're essentially in exchange that highly values transparency and then trying to execute is fairly as possible. So really, really, really, really great question. James says when someone says something has an IV of XYZ does that always have an expiration attached to it by default negative. That's a great question. So in general, when people are referring to the IV of a ticker, they're typically referring to the ticker for the underlying itself, which that is an annualized deviation. So what that means is let me get rid of this drawing tool. It messes up some of the other commands that will don't want that. There we go.

So I could put more parts in the car space becomes a premium. So yeah, literally whenever. Cool. Let me see what else. Mark says never heard front running using that context have you read flash boys.

Most of them have some sort of insider information and they absolutely will will act on that insider information. So that's an example of front running a move. It's definitely not limited to high for good trading in any way. There's obviously use in high for good trading, but in no way limited to it.

Yeah, that's solid solid homework for the compound interest thing you guys already know you can use the website that has that built for you. And those others. I actually think are pretty decent. So we will. We will review those. At the beginning of the next session. And then we will explore the next series of stuff. What is the next series of stuff that we have. Let's take a look. So for those that are curious what the next series is going to be. For the next episode. We have. I guess we kind of already went over most of this. So I'm going to change these. This one. I think we're going to do. This one we're going to change this. We're going to do option. Pricing. I think that's a really, really important one. So we'll do that one next. And then actually that's a lie. So I got it now. Here's what it's going to be. So this. This is done. This one I want to do option pricing. This will be pricing. Settlement decisions. So settlement decisions explicitly. I want to walk us through when and why we close options. So when and why we close option. When, why and how. And this I think is really important because it will help us get a little bit more. Close to the decision people make when",

Because I think I want to make sure that you all are starting this process as soon as humanly possible. Then we will talk about the Greeks. This makes sense here to me. This kind of analysis. This all makes sense to me. I think all of this. Days in the correct order. And then we have a couple. Flex sessions. The purpose of the Flex sessions is I'm literally going to use those to help us get a little dialed in on anything that is of particular interest to us. So that's why you see that here. And it'll probably be built up realistically as we move through this. I like I don't expect those Flex sessions to remain there. But I like to have a couple things built for us in the beginning and then leave a little room for us to explore a little bit because based on how the group works. The overall level understanding of things. That all helped me a lot. And I actually have one follow on poll for you guys because I started with how many have been trading for less",

And I actually have one follow on poll for you guys because I started with how many have been trading for less than a year. And it was a little over than 50. So if you've been trading for less than less than one year. Along. So let's do less than three months. Do three to six months. We'll do three to five months. And then we'll do six months plus. So this is specifically for the people that have been trading for less than one year. For the less than one year group. How long in there. And then. It looks like we're all caught up on the questions, which is perfect. Oh, yeah. But I think we're in a good spot. I think it's not. I am probably going to run through a little bit of the portfolio now. This is not tied to this session at all. So for anybody that's specifically interested in the options one of one series to begin our series. Perfect time to click off. And then for those that are just looking for general market update stuff. That's what I'm going to do now. Mostly for me. We can do that together just because it's what I'm going to do anyway.

For those that are trying to follow along with this that are trying to figure out what the homework is and stuff like that. You can find all this on the website. So if you go to here options trading guide, this Excel sheet or Google sheet is starting to become a general resource for everybody. And again, the reason why it looks like this is because I optimized it just for mobile. And I'm not smart enough to figure out how to do the desktop and mobile version. I'm pretty not adept at this. But down at the bottom. You can see there is the outlier option straining basic syllabus, which is here. So you will be able to run through and grab all of the stuff that you would like. So that's what we got for the session today. Beautiful. And now I'm going to just run through the market. What is it? So I'm going to run 42 06. So be stock market. All right.

But I would we were originally planning on going up to idle wild tomorrow. We had it all booked, but they even ran out of power because of like really high wind or something. So we're probably going to have to pivot and go somewhere else either tomorrow the next day. But we just kind of like bouncing around. We're actually going to go. I forgot the place in Washington. What is the name of that Washington? 11. Worth. This is where we're going. So we're definitely going to try to go to 11. What the? That's freaky. We're going to go here because apparently it's like a really cool winter town. That's the word on the show. So yeah, we're going to go check out this place. And that'll be a little bit later this month. It looks kind of cool. So that's that. Let's get back to this recess jobs tomorrow morning with. Outlooking. I can't remember CPI PPI or unemployment.

So those ones we're going to need a bunch of alerts on. Let's take a look at the watch list really quick. I want to make sure that all of those are in here. RGTI that's already in here. Cubits. U BTS that's already in here. U UBT that's new ad. And then I on Q should be. That's crazy. RGTI. I'm going to have to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one.
