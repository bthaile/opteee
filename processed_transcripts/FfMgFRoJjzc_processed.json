So the front expiration has fallen off now. And before this was like 900 and something thousand calls, if I'm not mistaken, and I don't remember what the parts were. Maybe high twos. I don't think they were over three. I think it was like maybe high twos. And we are, we're seeing like really, really interesting positioning. I think this 17 Jan expiration is going to be spicy. This is not the same thing. I hope it's not being perceived as the same thing as all these people that are calling like, you know, quote unquote, hype dates or whatever. Like that is not my bag. All I'm saying is that they're the reason why I say that is because there are a ton of fucking options in this expiration, a ton. That tends to lead to slightly skewed, slash interesting market behavior. The tendency moves get slightly more exacerbated because take a look at this of the remaining 829,000 calls, 485,000 of them are for this coming week. So this is why this is going to be a pretty spicy week, I think. Now I have no idea what the latest hype dates are. I have to be honest. I was tracking them for a little while and",

I have to be honest. I was tracking them for a little while and then I just stopped. I had a tracker that I built for it. And the reason why I stopped doing it is because I was having a hard time understanding the legitimacy of the hype dates as compared to people that are just throwing names out or dates out. The reason why I say that is when I see it on like Superstank, there's obviously a massive incentive for lots of people to try to guess when the next squeezes, right? Because then you look like genius. And it's also the kind of thing that you can guess 99 days and they can all be wrong. And if you get one, that's right. That's all you're going to talk about. That's what people will remember, right? So it's a really asymmetric way to try to gain glory, so to speak. But what I was doing is I was creating a tracker, actually, I had a web scraper that was going through Superstank in pulling the name of the author down, the hype date, whatever it was.

So it was very difficult for me to come up with anything meaningful other than lots of people are guessing, lots of dates, right? That's genuinely what I clearly could come up with from a statistical perspective. Now what I wish I knew were some of the actors. I wish I knew what the different participants were, like who they were and to try to discern between people that are actually doing research versus people that are just throwing dates out there, but I don't have that contact. Shinnossu says, saw two contrasting theories. If we are printed for equal, volume or price should start picking up on Wednesday. If Rally is over, we might dip below 200 day moving average. What is this for equal? What is that? What's equal? Do you just mean equal in the standard term? Or does that mean something specific in this case? And why Wednesday? I want to understand both of those more. Zacharias says, geez, Herman Miller going top tier. Yeah. So here's the deal. The Herman Miller chair, honestly, is pretty nice.

And the chair that I'm sitting in right now is a steel case. And this one is okay. Here's the deal. When you have a little bit more money, you can tinker with stuff like this. But it doesn't make a fucking difference. I don't really, I think if I sat on five different chairs, I might be able to say like this one's comfortable, this one's not. But paying two grand for a chair, it's just, it's like the same thing with cars. Get what you like. But I don't think that there's any significant value in like the hyper expensive stuff. One of the ones I do want to try is there's like these stools that put you in like a more upright posture. I actually really, really want to try one of those. I actually have one of those on the way.

My first opinion is the entire basis of the chart looks completely different to me. And let's take a look together. This will actually be, oh, this will actually kind of an interesting use for this. Also my wrist feels so naked. When I sit down like this a lot of times I'll charge my watch. And it's so strange not having my watch on feels bizarre. What I'm going to do first is literally just start from here and draw a general line that follows price itself. This is meant to indicate a gap down. Because now if I scroll down to this. I can overlay it. So. This immediate looks completely different. This includes the squeeze though. So let's get rid of that. And let's chart it chart it on this one. So here's what I see from an eyeball that looks similar. The oops. I'll do it in like pink so that it's a comparison. So this just the slope the broad slope. That's it.

That slope to that slope that looks similar. But as you can tell like it's missing very, very clear defining features right. If we were to overlay these against one another. The beyond the general slope that we're seeing. This the overall trend. I don't actually think these look. Accessively similar. So now. Let's see. What the volume looks like. So I'm going to go back up to this. Get our yellow line to match just like that perfectly. And then let's draw. Damn, damn it all to hell. Here we go. Let's draw volume now. In the case you guys didn't know obviously this is just an excuse for me to draw, which is funny enough I hate drawing. I really, really I'm like the least artistic dude on planet earth. And what I'm doing is I'm just going to denote days that have higher like higher than average volume like that. So like this. This is excessive volume. There's actually a smart way to do this. Oops. I'm just going to draw an actual line. Like that. And now what we'll do. Is grab the spots. We're volume is taking up. I'm going to line this up generally with the access there.

This matters because this is showing you average daily range average true range, which is volatility. If we take a look at this move comparatively, it's way less volatile than this move comparatively completely different. So yeah, the main thing is understanding like that the comment that I think who was it. Where is this? Yeah, Shinasu was saying they were the one that originally was saying that. You know, people are saying that it looks like it's setting up like it did last time. So that's all we're looking to explore, right? Like does that does that bear out does it look like it's setting up like it did last time? And I think from an objective standpoint, it does not.

And then this is looking at today. So no, BW. I was looking at the this one is 2021. And then this one is GME today. Yeah. Anyways, the broader point is I think it's completely okay, right? And this is what we should be doing. We should be analyzing this stuff. But the other thing I would definitely just offer to people is that the I don't think trying to compare. And I think somebody else said",

But the other thing I would definitely just offer to people is that the I don't think trying to compare. And I think somebody else said it beautifully earlier. Blanc Waze said exactly what I'm thinking is trying to compare what the setup looks like today. Compared to what the squeeze looked like in 2021. It objectively doesn't really matter that pull up because the squeezes, they're objectively not going to look the same. That's what makes them so interesting. So I think like even this lead in to this squeeze looked completely different than the lead into the 21 squeeze, right? Because the 21 squeeze is right after this, right? It's it's up over here. And the lead in to the main squeeze was actually a declining slope that then rapidly accelerated up and out. So what's most important to me from just a charting perspective is just paying attention to what the chart is showing us at a point in time. And again, the most beautiful part about these kinds of movements and squeezes as a profit mechanism is they, they present similar traits every single time. One of those traits will be a price breakout. Another one of those traits will be massive spikes in volume. Another one of those traits is going to be the average daily range is going to expand",

Another one of those traits is going to be the average daily range is going to expand across the overwhelming majority of these bars. Right? Same thing here. We come in quiet just like it was nice and quiet in here. The trend, the direction, the volatility, all that stuff looks slightly different. But the overall volatility, the overall volume looks very similar. Then all of a sudden we see a kick up in volume and we see the bars, meaning average daily range rapidly expanding compared to the prior timeframe, not comparing it to the 21 bars, but comparing it to the prior timeframe. And that's what we do here. We compare these bars against these bars. That's how we visualize volatility. That has happened for every single squeeze that has ever happened, but especially in GameStop because we analyzed every single squeeze that GameStop has had and what things looked like leading into the squeeze. This is actually why, in my opinion, the exploration of all these different cycle theories and these settlement theories and all of those functions are very interesting. But from a trading perspective, in my opinion, they're completely useless. And the reason why I say that is because it's a really complex way to try to analyze something that we can",

We can see it present much simpler when we see volume starting to break out when we see the candles starting to expand when we see price breakout from recent consolidation. We can see all that. So it doesn't matter what the settlement timeframe is. It doesn't matter if it's T 35 T 36. And if there was a holiday in it, it's here. I can see it. So while we go through these, I would just remind you of that fact because even though I truly am fascinated by the settlement and the cycle theories, I'm fascinated from that not from the perspective of how can I use that to predict the movement. I don't care to do that. I don't have to do that with that. I like analyzing that because I am just genuinely interested in those in the market mechanics behind it. You have to remember from my perspective, I've been trading. I just wrapped up my 18th year. This is kind of like people that do something for a long time.

I literally think it might be in here. This. Keep forgetting like the links. Don't carry over for some. Take a look. 8 November 24. If we take a look at this chart and we say, where's 8 November 24?

Okay, so 808. 808. Hear me, please. And then now we're at 4435. ED library review. Tweet. The hope is just to make the live streams easier for you guys to follow along. All right. So let's take a peek. This is from Big Daddy Dave Lauer. I just did a podcast or a live stream with him last week. We do one typically like once a month together for urban finance. And as I always make sure to tell you guys, I am affiliated with them. I'm an angel investor in their company. I became an angel investor after I'd spoken with Dave a few times. He's just a super solitude. I let that be known just because I think you guys should at least be aware of relationships and stuff like that. But it's literally just because I think what urban is doing is generally cool and I like Dave. Okay. So let's see. I'm just trying to get. Okay, here we go. This is a. This is a very Dave intro.

Dave has fucking ridiculously dumb pizza choices. And he also has completely, completely dumb, completely dumb expectations of steak. It's all trash. So I think what we might have a problem with Dave is that he seems to be a general foodie. And that's fine, but foodies tend to like everything. So you can't take his word for it because I had tried wagyu. I think I'm up to 12 times now because he has told me every time it's the greatest thing. So good. You got to get it. And every time I came back and I report back to him that it's straight trash. He's always just like, Oh, well, you got to try this. You got to get that. And then I'm like, bitch, I've tried every one of them now. I literally have tried one where they come out with like a sheet of paper that had pictures of the fucking cow, the individual cow and like the dude giving it beer and like massages.

Well, if you're out here in San Diego, I'll take you out for a steak dinner and you can try it and be disgustingly disappointed. I would actually rather pay for it than you pay for it because I wouldn't want to wait. I wouldn't want you to waste your fucking money on something like that. It's just rule. Yeah, I'll take care of you if you come out here. Got the opportunity. Citadel. Yep. Went to New York, Chicago wife. Citadel. Trading desk left. They went to he went to Austin trading.

Hold the story of why I left high frequency trading. Somebody on MPR heard an ask them to come on this program called market lace. Okay. So I did it was pretty cool. Suddenly people were really interested in talking to me Senate SEC. Some guys in New York. So he got sucked back in mostly just because of his background and his expertise. And worked at I.E. X. Okay, let's get. Oh, perfect. Here we go. Left for ethical reasons. What about your ethics made you decide to leave after the flash crashes? Well, I went into high frequency trading with maybe an IV naive romantic notion. This is how you can make markets work. It's the lubricant on the gears of capitalism. If you're a believer in capitalism, which I was to a certain extent. Still M you believe that type of philosophy. The flash crash kind of opened my eyes to this idea that maybe the speed of technology in the incentives in the markets were making things a bit more fragile rather than more stable and resilient, which is completely accurate.

So let me know if you have any ideas. Here are things I think we should change about markets. Literally laughed me out of the office. Yeah. That's that sounds right. So one of the reasons why you see this kind of behavior is because the incentives for markets still overwhelmingly line up with making as much money as you possibly can. And you don't really care if it's at the expense of you somebody else like as long as it's not at your expense. You don't really care. So this doesn't surprise me at all.

And the facilitating lines of communication between verified stockholders and the companies that they actually hold. And okay, I don't make or lose money in any way from what happens.

It's not like people call me up when things are going well. GameStop has been fascinating from the perspective of nutritional parts of the industry, which I tend to be tapped into. I've talked to lots of asset managers and other market trucker, ex-bit, fishy, not us. It's been incredible to see it. What I'm just discussing here is the general interest and focus on GameStop. But here's what I've, here's what I've generally picked up. It's like, it seems like stuff comes in vogue for a little while. And then it just kind of disappears. This is like the standard US news cycle. This isn't really specific, in my opinion, to GameStop, per se. So that part doesn't really surprise me to see him go on to these things and then come off of these things as the interest in the topics, ebb and flow. But what is a little more interesting to me is the stuff that he talks about. It at least starts getting into the heart and soul of some more difficult conversations. Because talking about market manipulation and stuff like that is not easy. And you have to have a pretty defensible position in order to be able to do it without getting crushed. So I, yeah,",

Talk to a lot of people concerned about the way that apps are structured, the incentivized over trading. So this is talking about stuff like Robinhood, which anybody knows, anybody that knows what I'm about. You know that I hate Robinhood with a fiery passion. I think that they're straight garbage. So any opportunity to reinforce that message of Robinhood being straight trash. I am here for it. I think people have not been in a market crash. I have no sort of understanding what that can be like. Yep, that's completely correct. He's not talking about GameStop in that context, particular. Here we go. Predatory short selling or naked shorting is a huge concern, which he and I have talked about quite a lot. Yep. I'm just going to flip to the TLDR on these because this just looks like he's kind of like recapping stuff. At least that most of us are aware of if there's anything new in here for any of you literally let me know tell me. I mean regulators move at a snail's pace.

So. So he's talking about the overarching incentive for order flow to be much faster. And as that starts to happen, regulators have a hard time keeping up with it. They still employ archaic principles that made sense years ago, but they hold back from having the best outcomes that we would achieve. I've really trading in many ways can exacerbate extreme moves by people piling in. This is similar to when we talk about things like dealer gamma. It's very different in a nutshell, but it's a similar concept to dealer gamma where we have market participants from an institutional side, structural side that then exacerbate the very moves that they're the broader market is experiencing. Latency requirements and computational latency has increased over the last 15 years, talking micro seconds for transactions. BBO. Yeah, this one's funny. Shows quotes in the market.

So it's just pulling the best quotes from different exchanges. That's the sip is the public data feed exchanges also have private data feeds are faster, show more information and high frequency firms all consume it. So these are lit exchanges. There's obviously you guys are familiar with these. And active price discovery. Yep. Lit exchange is providing a mechanism, but then in dark pools and off exchange trading, you're trading within the Mbbo you are free writing off that liquid. You're taking advantage of it. This is really interesting because the reason why he says this is the way dark pools operate. And this is a really broad misunderstanding for a lot of people in the broader trading community, specifically that follow stuff like GameStop. And let's let's talk about it. So what are you saying is that dark pools are using the lit exchange and BBO pricing as the basis for the transactions. So they're using that pricing, but they're not constraining themselves to the liquidity provided by that pricing.

So what's really interesting about this is it's combining the benefits of two different things and you're literally using the lit quote as part of your negotiation process. But you're not penalized by using the lit quote because you're going to try to transact through a dark pool, which prevents you moving the market against yourself. Now one note is dark pools still have a really nefarious name. It sounds really bad and all that stuff. It does absolutely impact price discovery. However, dark pools still hit the consolidated tape. There is just a delay. So I'm not advocating for or against outright. There are pros and cons to dark pools and I understand why they exist. But it's not this black box that people think it is dark pool orders will still hit the consolidated tape. What does not hit the consolidated tape are internalized orders. That does not aid in price discovery whatsoever, at least in an immediate fashion. It still kind of does indirectly. But yeah. Okay. It can disincentivize market makers. Yeah.

Because they know if I post the best bid, then Citadel of Virtue is just going to execute an order based on my price. And I'm not going to see it. So why should I improve the bid? Yep. Completely completely agree. Lauren says they are only delayed a short time though, right? Yeah, typically it's like six seconds. It's not long at all. Now it can be for like really big transactions. It can be longer than that. But the majority of the reporting from dark pools is pretty fast. I think it's very problematic leads to self similarity and does in does make markets more fragile because we incentivize speed. And we also, yeah, here, I'm glad he said this captive order flow because it's not incentivizing price discovery. It's just essentially incentivizing the ability to transact. Completely agree.

Access fee caps hasn't changed in forever leading to exchanges fighting over rebates. Okay. Let's see. Looks like Thor is ready to be let out, but before we let him out, you know, I'm a I'm a grab him real fast. So you guys can see him. Wait. Come here. Wow, here he is. So if you guys couldn't tell.

One, six, thirty. Booping and layering. This one's important. So Dave says I think that spoofing layering is a big problem. I can say from the experience of constantly looking at a market data for those patterns and seeing them relatively regularly. Can you expand? So you're talking about looking at level two order book. Which is the best bid and offer. The bid is the highest price somebody willing to pay. The offer is the lowest price somebody willing to sell. And there's the spread between the bid and the offer. Trades will happen, but above that offer, you can have at each price level a certain amount of volume that somebody is willing to transact that. So as the price gets higher, you can imagine more and more people are willing to sell as the price get lower and more people are willing to buy.",

So let me take a first pause here. Does this make sense? Can you visualize this in your brains? What does this saying? Because if not, I can draw it out really quick. It's a really important point to understand how the order book actually sits. So what he's talking about is that at different prices, there's going to be different posted volume by whatever entities that are willing to transact at those levels. And it will look different at different prices. So you can see that in a level two order book. I don't know if. Let me see real quick. I'm just curious if. So here you go right there. So this is for the equity itself, but this is literally a level to order book. And we can look through the broader book for different exchanges. But what this is showing you is from two different sides of the trade. This is showing you the bid. This is showing you the offer. This is showing you right now on the ARCA exchange.

And as it ticks up, it's just going to lay off into that. I'm going to end up flat because most high frequency trading systems want to be flat. They do not want to take on inventory. They're operating on very type right very tight time horizon is millisecond seconds. Maybe minutes, but yeah, in high for user trading. It's a long time. Does this next section make sense?

    "text": "in high for user trading. It's a long time. Does this next section make sense? What he's talking about is essentially the ability for high frequency trading algorithms to build a ramp for themselves. They already have a predetermined exit from their ramp. The one thing to keep in mind is that they still need price activity for the ramp to execute. Now what becomes really interesting is when there are multiple high frequency trading algorithms transacting against one another. That's what he's talking about in terms of high frequency trading starting to add to overall market volatility and not adding the market resilience. Because if you have one system that's building a ramp for itself, and you have another system that's trying to do something else and they're interacting with one another. It's essentially two robots going back and forth. That's not actual price discovery. It's completely different. But this part is important to understand not only from the perspective of the individual high for user trading firm and what it's trying to do, but then the broader point on the interaction between the high for user trading firms. That's super, super important. Okay, let me get my dinner order launched off. We're already all set with it. Boom. We already hit all that. Okay, let me get caught up on the chat. Chicken nuggets says, hey, not sure if you already covered this, but what's up with the 125 put on GameStop. What do you think? We talked",

Chicken nuggets says, hey, not sure if you already covered this, but what's up with the 125 put on GameStop. What do you think? We talked about the the far out of the money's a few time. It's not real different from the other conversations with the far out of the money options. That's a series of different behaviors. Part of it will be either used to create synthetic shares. Part of it will be used for hedging and offsetting positions. Part of it will be people speculating. So it's kind of a giant mixed bag of reasons why you'll see those being lit up pretty regularly. Michael says MFA closed at 95. I'm not worried about MFA in this stream in particular. Blanc's ways he says I got another question. Why would a market maker offer 190 put for GameStop since October while the rest of the chain max is out in 45 in both ways. What do you mean by that? I don't know what that part means. Why would they offer? Could you rephrase your question? So the first question is what expiration you're talking about. You're saying since October. But what expiration are you referring to? And then I still don't know what both ways means I'm assuming you mean like 45 points up and down from at the money maybe. But",

And then I still don't know what both ways means I'm assuming you mean like 45 points up and down from at the money maybe. But I'm not positive. The answer anyways is easy. The answer is because there's demand for it. So market makers offer options that have demand. And the way that they gauge demand is by looking at what transactions are happening at what places. So. Blanc's ways he says it's laying in Schwartz European options. You've just added another complete layer of confusion. They are open end option. I literally have no idea what you're talking about now. What platform are you talking about looking at the top? These guys. Okay. And so the reason why any sort of market maker offers options is because there's demand for it. That's why. So the answer remains the same. Now when it comes to max is out in 45 both ways. I don't really know what that means. I like because they will have more than that in other explorations and I also don't know what expiration you're referring to. But yeah, that's the that's the cliff notes version is that it will absolutely just be because there's demand for it. I have no idea who these guys are though. I don't never use their stuff or.

I can put in some bids and they're not the best bid. So I don't have as much risk of being executed on those orders, but I could put in a huge number of shares. A couple price levels down and create the appearance of demand. So this is where we're trying to manipulate where and why our counter parties. So in this case, if I'm a high for trading firm trying to compete against other high for trading firms, I can make their systems detect a large number of orders at a price that is just me trying to deceive them as they're being a lot of order there.

I don't see why there would be demand now. Could be a million reasons, but the demand demand is always relative to the individual, right? So you have to take yourself out of your own perspective and then try to think of the board from other people's perspective and why they might want something like that. And probably some sort of hedging. Okay, that's going to make these all. Yeah, that's going to make these automated systems think there is demand. So they're going to move up. But what I'm really trying to do is actually sell. So I'm trying to push the price up into my cell orders as a manipulator spoofer. That's why that's what the spoofing is layering is relatively similar. Yeah, boy. The broken part fallacy. I'm just like scanning through this.

It doesn't have to be manipulative when we think it liquidity contagions or flash crashes are like these things you describe sometimes. It's just them pulling out. So of 90, 90 of the quotes in the market are from high progressive trading firms. Sometimes it's high is 99 and suddenly the volatility increases are the take on too much inventory. They need to stop trading, which is a, which is a lot of what happened to an a flash crash. Proper in 2010, they'll just stop quoting and as soon as that.

And it's not just retail that doesn't make use of them large broker dealers, trading for institutional firms don't make use of them the way they should. Do you know what an ad liquidity only post no preference blind order would do because not even NASDAQ knew what it would do. NASDAQ got fine because they had some crazy complex order type that was messing with the priority in a way that they had not even imagined. That was discovered and self reported, but it's like that is complex. That is how complex things have gotten. So there are order types that do advantage firms. Yep, yep, yep, came in for order.

Yep, yep, yep, came in for order. I think we've probably beat this to an absolute bloody pulp. I don't think we need any of that stuff. Here we go. I think payment for order flow and the internalization of retail orders is terrible for markets and the thing about retail order flows that's referred to as uninformed. You're not informed about what's going to happen in the next 50 milliseconds when you think uninformed order flow. What it means what is about to happen in the market as far as high for user trading for misconcerned. At that time, horizon is measured in milliseconds, maybe seconds, because the retail order flow is what market makers want to trade against. It's very profitable to trade against it. Obviously. That's why these market makers pay the retail brokers for it because they want to get the order flow. An interesting paper just came out that showed the impact on markets is significant that when you take profitable order flow and you don't let it go to exchanges and interact with other orders on the exchange. You can be affecting this spread by as much as 25 percent. Maybe more crazy. We can skip through this. So one thing to note about payment for order flow. Again, that is worth noting is that payment",

However, it does increase overall efficiency. It does to a degree. So I still think payment for order flow has a long way to go before it actually would make sense. But that's why you have market making firms fighting for retail order flow. Okay, here we go. This is the important differentiation here internalizers. So here we go. Long lines of internalization and dark pools. Two different things. Yeah, okay. So we already talked about all this. Off exchange volume 89 percent. Every time Citadel internalizes a trade, it gets printed publicly every time Goldman Sachs. So we have to execute a trade in their dark pool. It still gets printed publicly. So this is what I was talking about earlier about them hitting the consolidated tape. You guys already know that. Look at you guys go. You guys are already market wizards. Okay.

That's why the 350 microseconds speed bump was put into place because it seemed like a good time for the exchange to be able to receive market data from all other exchanges updated price and shift for other firms could come in and pick off its sale prices, which makes a ton of sense.

It's going to have to take it's going to be super, super slow, which is annoying, but it is what it is.

So you click increased decimal places and you might think Eric. There's an error with your formula. Obviously that it's not mapping. You need to do the formulas. No, it's the formula is there.

I told you it's working just fine. 10. There's one million dollar fine would. So Dave's point. Obviously is wildly on point.

The funny thing like I'm actually not laughing at me or the jokes I'm making. I'm laughing at how comical this it's a fucking it's a joke. It's an inherent joke by itself. The fact that they would come up with a million dollar fine on and like even if it went to Kenny himself right. The personal like a sold person. It's zero 0.0023 of his net worth like it's crazy. So what I ended up doing is I'll show you equivalence here. Let's say that you're a. So what I did for context is I still kept the 100,000 US basic person right seeing a person as a 100,000 net worth. I'm showing you what the fine with the equivalent fine is formal US equivalent.

And then it would be the same as a person worth 100,000 paying 2.33. In that nuts. That's some crazy shit. That is absolutely some crazy shit.
