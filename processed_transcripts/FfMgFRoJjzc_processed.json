So the front expiration has fallen off now. And before this was like 900 and something thousand calls, if I'm not mistaken, and I don't remember what the parts were, maybe high twos. I don't think they were over three. I think it was like maybe high twos. And we are, we're seeing like really, really interesting positioning. I think this 17 Jan expiration is going to be spicy. This is not the same thing. I hope it's not being perceived as the same thing as all these people that are calling like, you know, quote unquote, hype dates or whatever. Like that, that is not my bag. All I'm saying is that they're the reason why I say that is because there are a ton of fucking options in this expiration, a ton. That tends to lead to slightly skewed, slash interesting market behavior. We tend to see moves get slightly more exacerbated because take a look at this of the remaining 829,000 calls. 485,000 of them are for this coming week. So this is why this is going to be a pretty spicy week, I think. Now I have no idea what the latest hype",

So this is why this is going to be a pretty spicy week, I think. Now I have no idea what the latest hype dates are. I have to be honest. I was tracking them for a little while and then I just stopped. I had a tracker that I built for it. And the reason why I stopped doing it is because I was having a hard time understanding the legitimacy of the hype dates as compared to people that are just throwing names out or dates out. The reason why I say that is when I see it on like Superstank, there's obviously a massive incentive for lots of people to try to guess when the next squeezes, right? Because then you look like genius. And it's also the kind of thing that you can guess 99 days and they can all be wrong. And if you get one, that's right. That's all you're going to talk about. That's what people will remember, right? So it's a really asymmetric way to try to gain glory, so to speak. But what I was doing is I was creating a tracker. I actually had a web scraper that was going through Superstank in pulling the names of the author down the hype date, whatever it was. And that's about all I could get and",

And one, there's a shit ton of different people, but people also regularly change their dates. So it was very difficult for me to come up with anything meaningful other than lots of people are guessing, lots of dates, right? Like that's genuinely what I clearly could come up with from a statistical perspective. Now what I wish I knew were some of the actors. I wish I knew what the different participants were, like who they were, and to try to discern between people that are actually doing research versus people that are just throwing dates out there. But I don't have that context. Shinnatsu says, saw two contrasting theories. If we are printed for equal, volume or price should start picking up on Wednesday. If rally is over, we might dip below 200 day moving average. What is this for equal? What is that? What's equal? Do you just mean equal in the standard term? Or does that mean something specific in this case? And why Wednesday? I want to understand both of those more. Zacharias says, geez, Herman Miller going top tier. Yeah. So here's the deal.

One, it's kind of like a like a bar stool one almost. And the chair that I'm sitting in right now is a steel case. And this one is okay. Here's the deal. When you have a little bit more money, you can tinker with stuff like this. But it doesn't make a fucking difference. I don't really, I think if I sat on five different chairs, I might be able to say like this one's comfortable, this one's not. But paying two grand for a chair, it's just, it's like the same thing with cars. Like get what you like. But I don't think that there's any significant value in like the hyper expensive stuff. One of the ones I do want to try is there's like these stools that put you in like a more upright posture. I actually really, really want to try one of those. I actually have one of those on the way.

So this is a one year daily. And right now we're saying that this looks similar to 2021. So let's see. I'm going to get that off.

And let's take a look together. This will actually be. Oh, this will actually kind of an interesting use for this. Also my wrist feels so naked. And I sit down like this a lot of times I'll charge my watch. And it's so strange not having my watch on feels bizarre. What I'm going to do first is literally just start from here and draw a general line that follows price itself. This is meant to indicate a gap down. Because now. If I scroll down to this.

And this has this slope, even from a slope perspective. It's different. Beyond the slope perspective. What I want you specifically to key into. Is how the slope is occurring, how it's showing up. This matters because this is showing you average daily range, average true range, which is volatility. If we take a look at this move. Comparatively. It's way less volatile than this move comparatively, completely different. So. Yeah, the the main thing is. Understanding like that the comment that I think was it. Where is. This.

Like does that does that bear out does it look like it's setting up like it did last time. And I think from an objective standpoint, it does not. This does not look like. What these two different lines look very, very different in my opinion compared to what the prior squeeze looked like. Now what I am going to do though is kind of save this. I'm going to get rid of all that. And then I'm just going to add a couple labels. So this is 2025. And then this is 2021. And then we'll monitor it. Right. We can keep an eyeball on it and see what it does actually look like. Because I again, I genuinely am interested. So let's hide that now. We should be able to paste it on like this. And then we'll keep it. We just have to get rid of all this. Resets. There we go. Beautiful. BW says you were looking at the 24 squeeze, not the 21 squeeze. This one. This is 21. Look, 2021. And then this is looking at today. So no. BW. I was looking at the this one is 2021. And then this one is GME today. And then this one is 2021. Yeah. Anyways, the broader point is.

But the other thing I would definitely just offer to people is that the. I don't think. Trying to compare. And I think somebody else said it beautifully earlier. And I think that's what I'm thinking is trying to compare. What the setup looks like. Today. Compared to what the squeeze look like in 2021. It objectively doesn't really matter that. Pull up because the squeezes. They're objectively not going to look the same. That's what makes them so interesting. So. I think. Like even this lead in to this squeeze. Looked completely different than the lead into the 21 squeeze. Right. Because the 21 squeeze is right after this. Right. It's it's up over here. And the lead in to the main squeeze was actually a declining slope. That then rapidly accelerated up and out. So. What's most important to me from just a charting perspective is just paying attention to what the chart is showing us at a point in time. And again, the most beautiful part about these kinds of movements and squeezes as a profit mechanism is they. They present similar",

And again, the most beautiful part about these kinds of movements and squeezes as a profit mechanism is they. They present similar traits every single time. One of those traits will be a price breakout. Another one of those traits will be massive spikes in volume. Another one of those traits is going to be the average daily range is going to expand across the overwhelming majority of these bars. Right. Same thing here. We come in quiet just like it was nice and quiet in here. The trend, the direction, the volatility, all that stuff looks slightly different. But the overall volatility, the overall volume looks very similar. Then all of a sudden we see a kick up in volume. And we see the bars, meaning average daily range rapidly expanding compared to the prior timeframe. Not comparing it to the 21 bars, but comparing it to the prior timeframe. And that's what we do here. We compare these bars against these bars. That's how we visualize volatility. That has happened for every single squeeze that has ever happened.

This is actually why, in my opinion, the exploration of all these different cycle theories and these settlement theories and all of those functions are very interesting. But from a trading perspective, in my opinion, they're completely useless. And the reason why I say that is because it's a really complex way to try to analyze something that we can see present much simpler. We can see it present much simpler when we see volume starting to break out when we see the candles starting to expand when we see price breakout from recent consolidation. We can see all that. So it doesn't matter what the settlement timeframe is. It doesn't matter if it's T 35 T 36. And if there was a holiday in it, it's here. I can see it. So while we go through these, I would just remind you of that fact because even though I truly am fascinated by the settlement and the cycle theories, I'm fascinated from that not from the perspective of how can I use that to predict the movement. I don't care to do that. I don't have to do that with that. I like analyzing that because I am just genuinely interested in those in the market mechanics behind it.

This is kind of like people that do something for a long time. You have to start looking at weird niche things to stay interested because you've seen so much of it so frequently. So that's why that the settlement and that stuff is so fascinating to me because that element of market mechanics is so curious. But from a trading perspective, it's much simpler than that. We track those three things. And between those three things, you're going to get stopped out a lot. It's not always going to work. But you'll, if you trade enough of them, you'll catch the bigger moves. That's the way that I look at it.

If we take a look at this chart and we say, where's 8 November 24? Where do we think? Right here. And why did I buy shares here? Well, I bought shares because it started rallying up and out. It had a big breakout day on volume. That's why I bought shares. Did I know if it was going to be a squeeze or just a standard run up? No idea. But I'll play the move. So that's the point is if we apply the general methodology, it's going to serve you well whether or not you catch a squeeze or not whether or not you catch.

Well, I went into high for good trading with maybe an IV naive romantic notion. This is how you can make markets work. It's the lubricant on the gears of capitalism. If you're a believer in capitalism, which I was to a certain extent still, M you believe that type of philosophy.

This isn't really specific in my opinion to to GameStop per se so that part doesn't Really surprise me to see him go on to these things and then come off of these things as the interest in the topics ebb and flow but what is a little more interesting to me is The stuff that he talks about It at least starts getting into the heart and soul of some more difficult conversations Because talking about market manipulation and stuff like that Is not easy and you have to have a pretty defensible position in order to be able to do it without",

Yeah, that is That's in fact what I think we're seeing market makers are disincentivized to post orders or post aggressive orders Because they know if I post the best bid Then citadel of virtue is just going to execute in order based on my price and I'm not going to see it So why should I improve the bid? Yep Completely completely agree Lauren says they are only delayed a short time though, right? Yeah, typically it's like six seconds. It's it's not long at all now It can be for like really big transactions. It can be longer than that But the majority of the reporting from dark pools is pretty fast I think it's very problematic leads to self similarity and does in does make markets more fragile because we incentivize speed and we also Yeah here I'm glad he said this captive order flow because it's not incentivizing price discovery It's just Essentially incentivizing the ability to transact completely agree Um Let me see You can imagine that when a broker do you like it's an order they're going to be sending that order to all these",

This is a little bit dated Yeah, I think we can skip through this okay Okay, it's more expensive to actually go direct to the exchange relative to go to a dark pool Due to access fees if he kept of 30 cents per hundred shares implemented in 07 led to exchanges competing over rebates i.e. x does not charge to the only charge 8 cents per hundred shares on either side Access fee caps hasn't changed in forever leading to exchanges fighting over rebates.

Okay, we're gonna talk about all this So what's moving is so you can know the best the way a high frequency trading system is calculating a micro price For example is the attempt So say if the high frequency system says okay, I think GME is worth 180 right now And it's being bid at 179.80. I can say well, I'm gonna improve that bid Right as I think it's worth 180 so I'm gonna put a bid out there at 179.85 So a nickel above because I want people to sell it to me And I want to buy it because I think it's going up to 180 and I think it's gonna happen very quickly So I'm only gonna have to hold the inventory for a few minutes before it moves up a couple ticks As it does gonna have my offers in there at 180 and as it ticks up It's just going to lay off into that. I'm gonna end up flat because most high-frequency trading systems want to be flat They do not want to take on inventory. They're operating on very type right very tight time horizons millisecond seconds Maybe minutes, but yeah in high-frequency trading.

That's not actual price discovery It's completely different so This part is important to understand not only from the perspective of the individual high-frequency trading firm and what it's trying to do But then the broader point on the interaction between the high-frequency trading firms. That's super super important Okay, let me get my dinner order launched off. We're already all set with it boom and Oh, we already hit all that. Okay, let me get caught up on the chat Uh chicken.

What do you think we talked about the the far out of the money's a few time It's not a real different from the other conversations with the far out of the money options, so That's a series of different behaviors part of it will be either Used to create synthetic shares Part of it will be used for hedging and offsetting positions Part of it will be people speculating So it's kind of a giant mixed bag of reasons why you'll see those being um lit up pretty regularly Michael says MFA closed at 95. I'm not worried about MFA in this stream in particular um Blanc swaysie says I got another question. Why would a market maker offer 190 put for game stops since October While the rest of the chain max is out in 45 in both ways Kd says when you say max is out at 45 both ways. What do you mean by that? I don't know what that part means Well, why would they offer Uh, could you rephrase your question?

I'm assuming you mean like 45 points up and down from at the money maybe But i'm not positive The answer anyways is easy the the answer is because there's demand for it So market makers offer options that have demand and the way that they gauge demand is by looking at What transactions are happening at what places so um blanc swaysie says it's laying in shwar's european options You've just added another complete layer of confusion They are open end option I literally have no idea what you're talking about now What what platform are you talking about looking at the chat You know what i'm talking about These guys Okay, and so The reason why Any sort of market maker offers Options is because there's demand for it. That's why So the answer remains the same now when it comes to Max is out in 45 both ways. I don't really know what that means I like because They will have more than that in other Explorations and I also don't know what expiration you're referring to but Yeah, that's the that's",

I don't I don't never use their stuff or It's so interesting because in other countries there's a lot more brokers in the u.s. It's very very siloed Okay back at it um Okay now if I know that okay That's how an hft works and I know it calculates a 180 micro price because it looked at all the bids on the market Seems there are a lot more bids than offers. I can put in some bids and they're not the best bid So I don't have as much risk of being executed on those orders But I could put in a huge number of shares a couple price levels down and create the appearance of demand So this is where we're trying to manipulate Where and why Our Counterparties so in this case if I'm a high-frequency trading firm trying to compete against other high-frequency trading firms I can make their systems detect a large number of orders at a price that is just me trying to deceive them as they're being",

It's really Long arduous you arduous you don't get much out of it So and then this I mean this is we've already talked about this looking through the prior dd library that the fines are absolute jokes I made a video Not that long ago hold on This one I don't know how to make the thumbnail show up I Shouldn't get copyrighted for this because this is my own shit So I'm gonna turn on the volume and we'll listen to a part of this video together because it's Oh, he sparred with gaudio Gordon smoked him All right, you guys should have audio What's up outliers quick market update and today it's a little bit of a somber one we have some bad news Unfortunately our fan favorite Kenneth C Griffin CEO of citadel LC So real bummer to see these kinds of things come down It's uh man citadel securities. They're gonna have to pay a one million dollar fine We're allowed jid finra rule violations, and you think like how could this happen right Ken obviously cares a lot He's a man of the people and for me I personally hate to see finra scc bully people that takes such good care of us so And",

So we have Kenny g 43 billion We have citadel 64 billion. We have a regular us person might be about a hundred thousand dollars Right, maybe total net worth something like that And we have our really big bad fine right here. That's this one which is a million dollars So you this might look like the math hasn't started yet. It is it has We just actually need to add a couple more decimal places So in putting this one million dollars in the context of Kenny g oand or citadel's assets This is what we have so you you click increased decimal places and you you might think Eric There's an error with your formula Obviously that it's not mathing you need to do the formulas. No, it's the formulas there But we just actually just have to add more decimals to understand what percentage of their net worth this one million dollar fine represents So let's let's just click it again It's like oh no google sheets isn't loading at this point because it can't be that low could it then we'll click it again and There we",

I told you it's working just fine Ken this one million dollar fine would re so Dave's point obviously is wildly on point So in that example for that million dollar fine it literally represents zero point zero zero one six percent of citadel's assets I Lawrence's Eric cracking himself up the The funny thing like I'm actually not laughing at at me or the the jokes I'm making I'm laughing at how Comical this it's a fucking it's a joke. It's an inherent joke by itself The fact that they would come up with a million dollar fine on and like even if it went to Kenny himself Right the personal like a sold person It's zero point zero zero two three percent Of his net worth like it's crazy So what I ended up doing is I'll show you equivalence here. Let's say that you're a So what I did for context is I still kept the 100,000 US basic person right seeing a person as a hundred thousand dollar net worth I'm showing you what the fine what the equivalent fine is formal US equivalent Which comes in at this",
