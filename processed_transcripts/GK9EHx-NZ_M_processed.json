So if you take a look across the industries for these companies that are absolutely leading and this isn't by the way a raw output, this is still filtered, I'm still looking at stuff that's worth at least a few bucks has at least some market cap to it and has options. So this is not a raw look at this metric. But if we look inside of this, you'll notice that if we take a look at the leading sectors and then we take a look at some of these broader performance, there's actually quite a few in here that buck that trend healthcare sticks out to me.

Healthcare has been doing very, very poorly, but we see medical here, we see medical here, we see medical here. So there's a bunch of medical companies that are just crushing it. Now, it requires a little bit of nuance analysis because biotech is very much like this, where there will be certain names that just absolutely smash it based on why, based on why they're seeking approval for a new drug and then with the subsequent approvals may or may not be. So it's a little bit of an anomalous circumstance. If we click out of the drugs side of things and we click into things like internet software, tech, insurance, insurance continues to crush it. So you'll find some key themes across the leaders here, but the themes that you see here don't necessarily directly align with the SP sector leaders, which is an important deviation. We'll go a little deeper into that tomorrow on the pro-stream because there's a couple of very tradable ideas in there playing a modified sector rotation analysis. But we just pretend that this name's not here. We'll just scroll right past that into some of these other names. And there's a ton of companies that are 100 plus over the last 52 weeks.

Those are the big ones that fall outside of biotech as broad buckets. So pretty decent spots, I think, to look for upside ideas as far as I'm concerned. But we're still seeing small caps struggle. Small caps continue to struggle pretty significantly. So if we take a look at a comparative move here from these two phases, kind of the dip to the low, close, or I guess this is an open, and then from that open to where we are now, down 20 and a quarter here, and then up 2377 here. If we do that same move, and this one we have to go further back in IWM because the highs back here, but if we measure that move here, it's 27. I guess a little more because I should have used this one. And then from here to here, it's 25.

Again, 25 here, 23 here, not big discrepancy, but enough that it makes the trade interesting to me. So and I've mentioned interest in small caps a little while, for actually a little while now, specifically from the lens of either trading the index or within the index, most of the stuff that I have on right now is not at the index level, but it's looking for leadership within the index because as always, we will continue to see that kind of behavior, which is worth tracking, at least for my style of trading. Hey, yo, what up Lauren? Joe Scott H. He says, biggie, why did you have to short GMEZ? So hard. Yeah, it's kind of a bummer to see GameStop didn't love the new offering. I get why they're doing it, but it does unfortunately punish the stock in the near term, like that's kind of all there is to it. And it's not massive, and I do think it's for the longer term benefit, and I'm comfortable saying that. That said, it still does have an unfortunate impact on the near term price performance. So",

So for those that don't know, there was another move, recent move by GameStop where there's another debt movement here. I think this is here. Wait, is this the Bitcoin buyer, the debt? I think this is all debt. Late Wednesday plans to raise more debt, a move that could indicate another Bitcoin purchases looming. The interesting thing is that they still have cash. So I don't actually know why they would be looking to raise another 1.75 billion when they have cash. And I believe in Cohen, the dude's smart. He knows more than I do. So there's obviously a tactical footprint here that I'm just not fully appreciating. But the thing that is unfortunate is that at some point, the debt needs to be reconciled. So, and I talked about this with the prior debt offering, which is there's no near term dilution right now at this moment. But there is a high probability of dilution in the future, depending on the way that they choose to reconcile the debt, because the terms of the debt matter.

So I, and I don't hate that idea, but I just view it as they already have cash, man. Like they have a lot of cash. Like start using the cash. The moving more into the notes and stuff again, it gives them more choices, more optionality. So there's a net benefit there. The other thing I can think of is potentially if there's something earmarked for the cash that they haven't let on to yet. And that's why they're not wanting to use the existing cash, which could be that to me is slightly more probable scenario. It's my best guess. But yeah, kind of curious here. We'll see. I still have the coverage triangle running in here. And I actually, I think I just moved my short puts, hold on, let me see. I don't know if I did or I didn't. I remember looking at them.

Right now the, the, when you're quoting stuff like this, when there is a big move after hours, all of this stuff is fucked up. So this stuff that's at the money, like the 25s, this is not actually a 36 delta. And this also in no world would be trading for 57. So that's kind of the tricky part of it will look a little more like these here. But Vaughn is going to pop up a little bit in them. But those are only at 67 utilization. So I will probably use at least one of my silver bullets and add a little more size right now. It's in the sample portfolio that I've been updating you guys on it's at just a six lot. So with just the six lots, it's at six lot at the 28s cash security requirement on those is 16,800. So the utilization on the 25K allocation is 67.2. So we still have some room to move, which we probably we being me and Thor will probably need to capitalize on some of that residual size, which is funny too because I was literally going back and forth on buying shares at some point, because I would like to start building at least a little bit of a holding in here.

But it's so hard to step away from the short put side of the equation not only because of stuff like this, but because of how range bound it's been, right? If I look over the last, this is a six month daily, like it's effectively flat. So this is really, really solid place for selling options because we're not getting these big massive moves. Now, one caveat is if we find ourselves back down in like the low 20s, there's a really good chance instead of buying shares, I'll actually buy options. And I will create an abomination of a strategy where it's kind of like a covered strangle plus a ratio called diagonal. The reason for doing that is more so because there's so much of all in the puts, you can't say no to it. And there's so much of all in the near term calls, can't say no to that. But by trading instead of shares with the long options at those kind of cycles, you just gain a little bit of leverage. And it allows me to actually make some decent money on these smaller moves.

And we didn't get a chance to go through a bunch of iterations, but you pretty much got to see the actual process of finding trades, building the portfolio, putting the trades on, and then figuring out how to manage those trades as things move. And that's really the broad iterative process of scaling a 5K account. However, I made a post on Reddit not that long ago that talked about a really important concept that I do think is commonly cited and it shouldn't be. So what I'm referring to here is, I will very, very commonly see some sort of post that talks about how trading options with a larger account is easy or just some flavor of that. And that just tends to come from a place of ignorance. It's not meant to be nefarious or anything. It's just misguided. And I wanted to spend a little time today talking about more specifically the things that change and the things that don't change when you are scaling a trading account.

Maybe I won't break out the handy dandy notebook. We'll have to call it something else. What the hell did that guy get charged with? That's the guy from, lose clues. He got him up for something. I don't remember what. But he did get him up. I don't know, one of you guys will have to tell me. But anyways, we'll have to call it something other than the handy dandy notebook. When we discussed this the last couple days, at least of the episode, not the last consecutive days, there were a few key themes that went into this. The first thing was goal setting. Well, I guess expectations. Then goal setting. Here's an example of this one literally from today. I was sent a post on this. And this is from this person, handful of days ago, it says, greed taught me a very valuable lesson today. I've been investing in",

This is a great example of why 10 year doesn't inherently mean anything. Some people will see a big number like that and they'll be like, oh shit, this person's got to have it figured out. And I'm going to show you in a big way why they don't. And it says they decided to learn about options, started with 25K three months ago, consistently made 500 a day that I trade on and then quit out. It's 2 return on investment on my initial 25K everyday, a trade which isn't everyday. That's not much, but it's adding up. I made a mistake today, blew my account by trying to go for more lesson learned, stop when you met your goal, even if it's 500, take the wind, shut it down. This is all wrong. It's literally all wrong. Everything about this is wrong. Greed gets you nowhere. I'm basically back to my initial 25K, but still motivated. Won't be taking any more risks like that.

And for anybody that struggles with setting expectations now, the only person you have to blame for not being able to do that successfully is yourself. There's no excuse anymore because it used to be difficult to find information, to collate different research, to identify like what's going on, why it used to be difficult. But now I literally go into Gemini and I say research, options trading with a small account. That's it. That's all I put in there. That's literally it. I didn't say profitability, habits, nothing. I gave it that simple of a question and it spent like eight minutes going through and finding all these different studies, many of which you're familiar with because we've looked at a lot of these together. But it literally spent time just collating all of this different research and then giving an output.

Once these two are done, this is hands down the most important part of this entire thing, bar none. Process, process. I cannot overemphasize how important this is with respect to your capacity to scale a small account. How effectively can you build a process? And the process should include simple things. The process should include planning. The process should include testing. It should include an observation. It should include an analysis. And it should include an optimization.

This is effectively what needs to happen for you to succeed long term as a trader, which is the concept of scaling a small account. Now this is all with the giant caveat of, and we did a very specific example before to show you how strong, how powerful saving is. Saving is the most important thing to do with a small account. It's the best return you're going to get. That's why when you have a small account, your return doesn't matter. Literally doesn't matter. What matters is building a process that then can be scaled. So I want to talk about that exact thing. I want to talk about this subset here. How do we scale our process? Because at the end of the day, that is the ultimate determining factor on if this is going to work for you or not. I want to mention a couple things quickly. This is not shit that like I just knew. And I've just been doing this my whole trading career. That's not the case at all. I was an absolute train wreck my first few years. And we can classify train wreck differently. My version of train wreck is probably different than the people that are like blowing multiple accounts. I've never done anything like that. But comparatively, an absolute train wreck.

What do you guys think about. X, whatever this thing is. Is this like our first actual bot? That's crazy. I'm not going to let the bot go for a second. I'm actually really, really curious.

The application is always where it's more challenging. So the very first thing we need to do is get organized. This doesn't change.

This is building a trading plan. Trading log. The reason why you will hear me mention these inter perpetuity until I fucking die is because these are the things that literally turned my trading around. My first two years of trading were slightly negative. It was both were in single digits, but it was essentially first two years negative. However, if you think about what I was probably doing for those first few years, it's what everybody does. It's randomly bouncing around between things completely haphazard, not tracking anything. So then when it comes back to me trying to make a logical decision, I can't make it because I don't know. So a great question to ask yourself right now in the chat is based on one of your trading approaches. Think of whatever strategy, profit mechanism you like to try to capture. Think of one of them. And I want you to answer this question. Whether it's a buys strategy sell strategy, it doesn't matter. Literally doesn't matter. For your strategy. Is it better to exit the trade sooner or later? That's it. I'm ambiguous. Not defining a date, not defining P and L. Is it better to exit your trade sooner or later?

So for example, if I'm talking about my breakout approach, is it better for me to exit sooner or later? Generally sooner depends, but generally sooner. I can confidently say that. If I'm playing some sort of coverage triangle, is it better for me to exit sooner or later? Typically later, let that run longer. What I'm just rattling off the top of my brain. Is stuff that I've spent time analyzing when I'm building the trading plan. Because within the trading plan are things that I refer to as strategy outlines. And you guys have seen this in the trading. I forgot the name of the video, but if you search my channel for trading plans, it'll come up. And in strategy outlines, there's a couple key stages. There's the exact summary. There's a setup. Management. AR. That's it. Some slight different versions terminology around it, but same same.

If we had spent any time whatsoever planning this strategy, we would understand the potential repercussions of sizing things. But this person had no idea.

If you can't answer that you have some work to do. And so on and so forth. It's a process of outlining this thing that we're going to try to implement. Now let's say that you're not sure and that's okay. You might not know, but it means then we now have an RFI. A request for information. It's military term, but it's it's when we need data. And let's say for the wheel specifically, I'm stuck right now for optimal. Sale window. And then we have a short put slash short calls. Okay. So the first thing I need to do is contextualize this question because I already know that this is secondary. Right. Because if you remember the executive summary, the first thing we said is the primary profit mechanism is the underlying going up. Yet a lot of traders will spend more time on this question than the one that actually matters, which is what tickers and how do I find those tickers",

And I did in this scenario that we've done that and we have a sense. Now we're looking at what's the sale window for these short puts and short calls. Well, we can test it. We can back test if we have access to a platformer if we know how to back test using our own data. All of that stuff can be done. Or we can live test it in a trade log via paper trading. The reason why we pay for trade is because it's a way to get live data. So then what we can do is we can say, all right, I'm going to test selling these options at 90 60. 40 30. 20. 10. I'm going to test all of these. Here's the cool part. It doesn't take that much work. All you do is set up the trade log for the strategy. And then when you go in to sell your option. In this context of paper trading, it's for data collection, not to implement the portfolio. So we're treating this a little bit differently.

The reality is you might, and you should want to optimize this is best you can. But this is still secondary. So I personally wouldn't wait until I know the distinct answer to this before I start trading it. I can come up with some assumptions. So if we understand options deeply, one of the assumptions we know is the rate of data decay. We also know which ones have most extrinsic value.

I would rather traders be able to do what they want and not have their handheld. The reason why PDT is there is because of the statistics. Because most people are going to fail in like the money on fire. This just slows it down a little bit. Now. These structural changes do change things though.

It shouldn't change that much because the primary components that go into building in edge literally can be done with no money. You do not need any money in an account to start exploring profit mechanisms to begin measuring them to understand deeply how options work so that you can use that information to make educated assumptions on what structures might make the most sense for an idea. Those kinds of things all happen completely regardless of your account size. So I'm going to take a pause there and I want to see if you guys have any questions on any of that stuff. This was a little bit more of like telling you guys stuff versus as interactive as I typically prefer these to be. But I think this kind of thing is just so important for traders to",

But I think this kind of thing is just so important for traders to get their arms around because what most people are doing when you have a smaller account is you're literally building the skill so that when you have a larger account, you are able to effectively implement that account. Because again going back to what we talked about in the very beginning there's not like a magic switch where trading all of a sudden becomes easy with a big account not the case at all you still have to do all of this stuff in order to create success for yourself. And it generally looks a lot different than what people expect but the cool part is it's super doable. It's super super doable. That's the thing I always go back to with the concept of trading options is that I am I'm like shamefully far away from the smart people. But it doesn't require like some insane amount of genius to figure out how to trade and to implement trading it requires having like robust process. And if you build a robust process it doesn't really matter how fucking smart you are you're simply going to see something isn't working. And then you are going to have to try something",

So feel free if you want. Godwin says you do not need to use the box spread just buy S cover bill and they still allow you to trade with the money. Yeah the problem with those is twofold the first thing is the yield you get is dragged the second thing is the way that the return on that is taxed is disadvantageous.

Let's take a look at as government. Here's the other issue is the holding duration matters actually kind of a lot depending on where you get in on these gaps right so the difference between here is 150 here it's 151 then it's 155. Right so this is not a linear relationship there are gaps that happen throughout something like S. So there is a little bit of a timing element not a big deal but you do have to be aware of that because you can get out at a sub optimal day. So just another thing to generally be aware of.

Tommy says box spread how long do you typically hold a position at one time it depends on what I have out so.

So I'll just move out to july yeah so I'm out in july now i'm in 18 July so what I'll do is i'll make sure that the box spread doesn't extend past this often i'll try to keep it up.

And if i'm looking at this and I see that the liquidity potentially between let's say where I might want to be so 18 July 36 days out so maybe I try to find myself into any of these 11 14 15 any of these and let's say that I go into the 15s and i'm trying to build the box spread if i'm trying to build the box spread in here. And it's like really a liquid comparatively to what I might get in the primary then that'll change what I'll do so literally will build one right now and let's see what's up so let's do maybe 5560 500 let's see what that gets us.

Potentially and this one is 996.15. By 1005.1 okay so now let's go to the primary expiration let's see how that same thing looks here so we'll close this out. We have to add some more strikes. Let's get to the 55s. And the 65. Were you at 6. So this one is running 994.9. And 1002.75. Let's calculate the bit as spread on these. 7.85 points. And 8.95 point. So that's the drawback here is when trying to trade the box spread on stuff like this.

But I did put myself in a non standard expiration to de-conflict because I had a bunch of stuff from the coverage triangles in that expiration cycle. So yeah the short answer to that Tommy is it really is based on where the coverage triangle cash is going to be needed if assignment is likely. And there's also the ability to like it's not a giant deal. If I have a box spread that's out and I get assigned on shares that I otherwise have the cash for. But it's not available. That's when you would just be on margin. You would be borrowing from the broker because they would be supplying the cash to be into the position. You just do the math and see how much the carrying cost is on a daily basis and see if you care about it or not. It's really easy to de-conflict it's the other thing you can always do is just close the box spread I really try to avoid that at all costs. Sometimes you have to be really really thrifty and leg into or out of it but lagging a box spread is super challenging and you have to accept the risk that goes with that because there is a decent risk. But typically able to get a better",

Sometimes you have to be really really thrifty and leg into or out of it but lagging a box spread is super challenging and you have to accept the risk that goes with that because there is a decent risk. But typically able to get a better fill by lagging into them. It's just you run a not insignificant risk of something moving quite a lot while you're trying to get in on the spread. So just have to be aware of that. Tommy says I bit covered strangle what's the current utilization and share short puts. Yeah, let's see. So I bit. I bit is currently 51.7 utilized in total. 7.5 of that is stock 44.3 of that is cash secure puts so mostly mostly inputs which will also likely continue to be the case my expectation. Unless we get a pretty significant pullback but right now the return on invested capital that I'm getting on the puts is too good. So I'm getting like 2.1 return on invested capital for a 20 day trade 1.1 for a 2 day trade 1.7 for 12 day trade 2.1 for a 12 day trade. All of this has to do with the the wall that's in I bit which makes it also a really solid candidate for the box bread side of things. So that's where we're at there. Cool. All right, gang. I'm a hop off gets work as always. If you guys need anything hit me",
