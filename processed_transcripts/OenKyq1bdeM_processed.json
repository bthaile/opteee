That absolutely is something that happened today. But this is where we are. We're literally 2.17 off of all time highs. So what I'm doing is I'm zooming out little bit by little bit to give you more and more context with this thing that we're talking about. This is a 10 year monthly. I actually, yeah, monthly is okay for this. And then this is obviously a weekly chart that goes back. But this is where we are right now. And if you take a look at the market and people are out there saying, oh my God, the market is falling, it's crashing. Here's the vols, the bears are here. There's like a million different things that I'm seeing flying around in. I think it's important to remember this context that I'm showing you is that literally the market is just off of all time highs. It's 2.17. Paul says 1.71. Did I misspeak? If I said 1.7, I was wrong. It's 2.17. 2.17 off of all time highs. So we're still literally parked at highs. So this came from a lot of different things on the day today. We will get all of that on the Sunday live stream getting ready for the week ahead and whatnot. That is not what the stream today is",

We will get all of that on the Sunday live stream getting ready for the week ahead and whatnot. That is not what the stream today is about. The stream today is about options trading basics which is exactly what we're gonna get into. So the agenda switched a little bit for those that don't know. I was originally planning on doing, navigating an options chain today. But a couple days ago, I had a pretty rough about a food poisoning. Like it put me down for like an entire day. I haven't had something like that before. So I didn't get a chance to build the materials as I would have wanted. So the agenda today is gonna be more of an open QA. And what I did was is I sourced the food poisoning. Is I sourced a bunch of questions from DMs and emails that I've gotten. So we'll take a little time looking at those. And then there's a couple broader topics that I wanted to talk about just openly, right? A loose conversation to get the dialogue started. So the agenda for today is essentially that. Now as always, I do have a quiz for you. So don't worry about that. There's always time to recap and knock out a quiz from what we covered last time. So let's start with the",

There's always time to recap and knock out a quiz from what we covered last time. So let's start with the quiz. So this is the quiz from last, the session last week, which was on the Greeks. The first question I have for you is what is the difference between first, second, and third order Greeks? I want you specifically to think about what these different Greeks measure. And realistically as long as you understand the difference between first order and then second, third, then you're pretty much good. You have a decent idea of where I'm going with this question. And in the meantime, I'd love to say hello to everybody's who's coming to hang out and learn about options trading on this awesome Friday. So we got Lauren, Paulo, Dakota. We also got Ian, great to see everybody. Lauren says, so can you collect a dividend when you sell call options? Good question. It depends on if you hold the underlying. So what's the difference between first, second, and third order Greeks? Who knows the answer to this one? Any guesses? And I need to get this stuff out of my way so that we can get the handy dandy right and pad ready to go as well without knocking over my salt water. No guesses. Okay. That",

And I need to get this stuff out of my way so that we can get the handy dandy right and pad ready to go as well without knocking over my salt water. No guesses. Okay. That makes me a little nervous because it leads me to believe that we might not understand the Greeks as much as we might need to. Okay, so let's break the question down. What do first order Greeks measure? So first order Greeks are Delta, Beta, Vega, and Ro. Ian says second order Greeks measure the change of first order Greeks. More or less. So first order Greeks measure changes with respect to price. So Delta gives us rate of change per one point move. Beta gives us, and this is premium. Beta gives us premium rate of change per one day passing. Vega is the premium rate of change. Is the premium rate of change per one percent change involved and so on and so forth. So the important thing to remember with first, second and third order Greeks. First order Greeks measure premium impacts. Second and third order Greeks measure other Greeks. And the reason why that's important is because this is also why gamma, you'll notice gamma was not in that bucket of first order Greeks. And it's because gamma measures the rate of change of Delta. So gamma is actually a second order Greek. Okay, next question.",

Ian says negative delta, negative gamma, positive theta, and negative Vega. Okay, so we're gonna need some tie breakers because we have some different answers. James says, oh, sell, okay. So then there's no fully cracked answer yet. Let me hide this. Big Ab says it's the equivalent of buying a put as far as delta is concerned. No, it's not the equivalent of buying a put.

Ian beat you to it before. Lauren says delta is negative, theta is positive, not sure about Vega, okay. So think of it this way. Now for everybody that's listening in to make sure I'm not confusing anybody, Ian was the first one to answer it fully correctly. So and then it looks like James got it sorted out later. The way to think about answering something like this is just think about what the symbols would be for each of the Greeks. Now when we're looking at an options chain, the symbols are essentially under the premise of being long that option. So right now this is long 54 delta's. This is short two dollars theta. This is long 6.55 Vega. And gamma is not flat. I don't know why gamma is as flat there. Let's come in here. I don't know why gamma is all messed up. It's probably because the market is closed. It's just because the platform gets really squirrely when the market's closed. So I'm using spy now just so that you can see gamma, which is positive 0.02.

The end says further. What other guesses? Lauren. Lauren, you got me a grinning from ear to ear. Fuckin' A. Nice job. Lauren, you are 100 correct. That's awesome. It entirely depends. Steve says depends on time expected for the move. Part of it. Yeah, that's exactly correct. So Lauren is spot on. Now, a lot of times you will probably be familiar with my general preference for buying options, which is typically going a little bit further out in time. But there absolutely are instances where buying a near dated option for a bullish play can make a ton of sense. So it entirely depends. So if you're looking at the market, it entirely depends on the idea. And I'm really, really proud of Lauren for nailing that one because this is also, it's a trick question, right? This one I give you two choices. And it's up to you to",

Even though this is listed as should I do blank or blank, rarely in trading is the answer this or that, very rarely. So yeah, I actually am pretty stoked on that. That's a completely accurate response. So nice job. Good good work out of you. Sweet. Now let's get out of this quiz. Let's run through the recap on the Greeks. And obviously we already hit this in the quiz, but understanding the differences between first, second order. That's really important because really when we start compiling Greeks together to look at composite Greeks. So when we're looking at second and third order Greeks, they matter to a degree with individual options, but these really become way more important when we're aggregating the Greeks up to the portfolio level. And it's because this is how you can start to see weaknesses, gaps, potential risks in the total portfolio positioning, even though each individual position might be put on in a safe way or in",

So that's the whole point of understanding the differences between the different orders is because it can help you view things at different levels, trade level, composite level. We understand the impacts now of the net Greeks, whether we buy or sell. When you're looking at an option chain and you buy, when you're looking at an option chain, it's not the context of buy. And if you sell, it's essentially the inverse of everything you see there. And the reason why this question fell in the Greeks side of things is because we spent a while talking about using the Greeks as a tool to help us build positions. That's the main point I want you to take away from when we're looking at something like the Greeks, is that if you understand how to use the Greeks for information input, it can help you build smarter positions that more accurately reflect what you're actually trying to accomplish as a trader.

But as we talk about these, I would love for you to weigh in with other questions, other areas, other elements that you're interested in diving into. So the first question we have on here is how long does it get or how long does it take to finally get it as an options trader, which is a really interesting question.

And it's really interesting because it's kind of like any sort of skills based assessment. If you think about how long it takes anybody to pick up any skill, you already know it's highly dependent on the person in the skill. What I can tell you is that just like we do things in the Marine Corps in trading, it's not based on time, it's based on a standard. So the way I would think about how long does it take to finally get it as an obtuse trader is way less as a function of time and way more as a display of proficiency. Now the short answer to this is we literally can take a look at some really basic math that help us at least frame how long this might come. And this might conceivably take right because it is a good it is good to have an idea of things. So if you pop over to the website under resources, there's this tab to traders make money.

And the thing that I want you to really hone in on those where mastery is considered. And if we take a look at the 10,000. I'm grabbing the actual publish study for you guys. There it goes. So there's a study on this mastery concept. Now I want to be very clear. 10,000 hours isn't like the actual end all be all form quote unquote mastery. You can develop mastery and something faster. There's also things that take longer than this. We normally throw this around because it gives you an idea. And that's why I think that this is relevant to you here because the broader question.

So that's another timeline that now is actually really important to us. So this gives us two important data points now that we can at least start to reason through this. We know 10,000 hours is where we might find mastery. And we know that most traders typically wash up within five years. So the first way I would think about framing this is after five years. If you are profitable and achieving your objectives as a trader. I think that that is a probably early depiction of the timeline. But I think it's a fair starting point takes a while to get this stuff down. Now just because you might not have it fully dialed in in that time frame doesn't mean that you still can't be profitable. But it does mean it takes a while to pick up the skill set because there's a lot that goes into this thing. So that's the the cliff notes version. I think of the answer. I think if I were to think of a trader's timeline and just kind of eyeball it",

Is taking stuff that you've seen somewhere. Dusting it off. And then kind of reconfiguring it to your own purposes. There then will come a point as a trader. And it can be before this again. These are very loose timelines. I'm essentially thinking of the average trader. That's probably spending somewhere between an hour to two hours on this a day. Which is still not an inconsequential amount of time for most people. But in that kind of timeline, it's going to take you quite a while. Because again, if you go back to what I was showing you here.

Assuming that most people aren't going to have that kind of time. That's why the timeline as I'm drawing it out for you guys is extended like this.

So a lot of details obviously went into that answer the short answer I think would be after two three years you probably have your feet under you after five years is probably when you're going to be showing a least a base level of proficiency. And it's way more based on your capacity to produce fairly predictable returns. If you're trading and you have no idea what the year is going to look like for you at all, then you're still a long ways off from it. Ian says also the lower you lower the volatility of your asset portfolio diversification is great.

Well, that is a really solid return. But that 20 on your hundred thousand dollars gives you a hundred twenty K like nobody really cares. It's a great percent return. The gross dollar amount really doesn't matter that much. So diversification has to be approached very tactically because if instead of prematurely diversifying the small amount of money.

And instead of trying to split it into a bunch of different things and maybe instead I keep this at four hundred K and then maybe put a hundred K somewhere else to start that process if I was so inclined. Then this actually is a fairly meaningful amount of money right then you're at one eighty. So like I guess adding on top of that my bag you get eighty. Then you bet for eighty. The main point is diversification is good. But I think it's broadly misunderstood and I think people over diversify actually as far as I see it typically, which is a really great point. All right. The next question here is how much time do you spend trading? This is a really interesting one. And the reason why this is such an interesting question is because there's two very different parts of my brain. There's the part that is executing a strategy. And then there's a part that's just interested in markets. And then there's the part that actually spend clicking buttons and putting on trades is minimal throughout the course of a week. Like if I were to ballpark it on a weekly basis, how much button clicking like time spent actually like building a position to put the position on.

So my guess is somewhere closer to maybe twenty to thirty minutes. If that something like that, just guessing obviously depends on the week and a bunch of other stuff. But the time spent actually trading for me is very little. And it comes to trading is you will have heard me talk about this before. But essentially all of the work in trading is done before you trade. And that takes a ton of time. And you've heard me quote you can go on my website and you can see how I ballpark the total amount of time that I've spent on this stuff. I just wrapped up my 18th year of trading. And I unequivocally have spent over thirty five thousand hours in markets, either studying, learning or trading. Like some variation of those. So I've spent a ton of time.

And the reality is and you guys are ready to know the answer to this. It's not going to be fast easy money. It's just not a thing. Now, inversely, very cool part about trading is that once you do have your approach built. It really is pretty easy to execute. And then it also depends on what you're comfortable with as a trader. Comfortable with lower touch points higher volatility of the portfolio. You can get by without trading very much. I always share at the end of the year the performance of my trading account. But then also my IRA account. And the reason why I do that is because I don't trade much of my IRA account. And it typically performs pretty damn well. And it's really to show that you don't have to be mega involved in order to drive solid returns. A lot of it actually is getting out of your own way.

Can you give me the TLDR of your profession, essentially. So now all that stuff aside and trying to coach people how to get more successful answers. I think the way that somebody can get to the point where they're making consistent money is if they go through the process of building their own approach. I think that that's so important. I was actually just talking with somebody in the discord earlier today about this. It's the same thing in the military. The process of planning literally is more important than the output of planning almost always. Right? Mike Tyson has that great quote. Everybody's got a plan to get punched in the mouth. The thing with planning is that the output, the plan itself, very rarely is going to directly reflect what you're going to see. That's just the reality. But that aside going through the process of planning is extremely enlightening. You can learn so damn much from the process of planning. So the way that you get to this to this point is through the planning process. And I will show you. So if I go into the discord here. And I just want to show you some of the conversation I was having earlier with one of our members, Apollo. And so this is in",

And I just want to show you some of the conversation I was having earlier with one of our members, Apollo. And so this is in the open part of the discord. Everybody's welcome in here. And Apollo had mentioned there's a bot that I built that essentially just opens up a dialogue right as people how did you go essentially and since it's a Friday, how do we go. And Apollo responded that they're sticking to trades longer than they should negative return on the week. That's actually a really good self identification that's solid. So then I ask what's the fix one of the things that you'll note about me is I could easily tell them what they should do to fix this. I think that literally sabotages them of a learning experience. I think the process of thinking through things is just like the planning process I was referring to earlier. The process of reasoning under your own accord with guided inputs is much more valuable than me just giving a blank answer that says you should do this. And you'll see why in a second. So I asked him what the fix is. And we went back and forth. And he was saying planning things in advance and sticking to the plan, which is actually a really, really great insight. Also something",

So then I was asking, you know, tell me more about what's happening because at this point, if we're saying something like stick to the plan that then calls into the question of do we have a plan. And if we do have a plan, do we trust the plan. So that's what I'm probing for in this. And now we have a little bit of hindsight bias. They're essentially looking back and they're saying, well, if I had done blank, then this other thing would have happened. This is really common. It's a really common bias for just about everybody, but it's the exact wrong way to analyze things after the fact. It doesn't really X and he doesn't do anything for you because there could have been the exact other scenario where you exit the trade and then it flies in your direction even more and you could have made more money. This I can immediately glean that we're still far too focused on the outcome of individual trades and not enough on the process. I can glean that from this exact statement. Now the reason",

This I can immediately glean that we're still far too focused on the outcome of individual trades and not enough on the process. I can glean that from this exact statement. Now the reason why this is so important is because when somebody is still so hung up on the outcome of individual trades, it tells me the underlying strategy is lacking because if you have a solid underlying strategy that you believe in that's robust, that is not lacking, you naturally start to deprioritize the outcome of individual trades. So that's why I told him in this case, based on this comment, I think we're looking at the wrong thing and then going down a couple other things. I want to show you where is it here. So essentially, they're saying that they're trying to trade the contraction of volatility post earnings. Okay, that's fine. That's a completely reasonable idea. And they're saying, I'm asking, okay, then how do we actually measure the movement of volatility around earnings? The reason why this question matters is because guess what the profit mechanism here? They're telling me what the profit mechanism and they're telling me that the profit mechanism is volatility contracting after earnings. But then when I ask, how are we measuring that? We're not even measuring that. We're saying we're just seeing how the position returns. Well, that induces a bunch of other",

We're not even measuring that. We're saying we're just seeing how the position returns. Well, that induces a bunch of other factors into the profit and loss. You're going to have delta inclusion. You're going to have theta inclusion. So there's going to be other things impacting the piano of your actual position. You're going to have things like delta decay impacting your position. So the issue here is that we're not actually even measuring the thing that we're trying to accomplish. So guess what? This is like if I was trying to win a three point shooting competition, but nobody counted the number of shots that I made. Tough to fucking know if I won or lost, isn't it? Right. The point here is that if we can accurately identify a profit mechanism, we have to measure it. So in this instance, we accurately identified a profit mechanism, which is fantastic, but we've not measured it. That's a problem. This goes back to the point I made earlier of detecting a lack of underlying strategy. This bolsters that original hypothesis that I had. Then there was this. If I get 70 to 80 return, then I sell.

I asked are we doing single lots multiple lots and they said, well, they're doing three to 10 lots. Yes, that's too big. Two things. One, there's actually no way on planet earth for me to know from the data given so far if this is too big or too small. So the fact that they're autonomously putting this in that this is too big, it tells me that they know they're actively making a fucking mistake because a 10 lot, depending on the size of the stock and the size of the portfolio can be completely reasonable. It can even be undersized. But this tells me that again, there's no underlying strategy because part of the strategy is sizing. This is saying. This is too big. So we're not following the strategy. Then come down here. If I get 70 to 80 return, I sell. I'm beginning to think that this is too high as well. Yes, what this tells me. This is unresearched. We're taking another guess. And guess what? We're not measuring. So it's no surprise to me that when we look at hollows path with this and for those hopefully that can see what's going on",

So it's no surprise to me that when we look at hollows path with this and for those hopefully that can see what's going on here. I mean, no way picking on polo. You'll actually notice the people that are putting in the effort to try and learn. I will always give them the time of day like this. Right. Like I don't get much out of this to be completely honest with you. This doesn't necessarily help me a whole lot. But I really like helping people, especially people that are trying. And I can see that from the fact that polo answered how the week went with an honest self assessment that polo is trying. I'm always here for that. So anyways, this being a random number that we tie on and say I'm beginning to think that's too high as well. It tells me it's not researched. Go all the way back to the first thing I said, we don't have a fucking strategy. So here's the problem. And this goes all the way back to what we're talking about here about making consistent money. The process of building your own strategy is so unbelievably important because if you take the time to build your own strategy, you inherently understand the landscape.

There isn't the question of I think I'm staying in trades longer than I should. All of those fall off because it's defined. Now one thing to note, my opinion is as a new trader, it is so much more important to strictly follow the plan. As a season trader, you get to have more creative license. You get to break the rules a little bit. For me, my trading plan is more like trading guidelines. I generally follow the core concepts of the majority of what's in there. But I always have a saying that I like to use, which is the trader has the last say it's not the plan that I wrote out. It's whatever I'm seeing is the trader and whatever I think as the trader on scene, whatever I see makes the most sense. Now you only get to do that once you have a demonstrable skill set.

It's kind of like when you see professional athletes doing things that are fundamentally unsound, but they're professionals. They kind of know when they can get away with a little exuberance and where it might actually be optimal based on what they happen to be seeing at that point in time and they have the skill at that point to pivot in that way and take advantage of that opportunity. The same thing with trading. It's literally the same exact thing with trading. So the main note here is the way that this person or literally any other person can get to the point where they can consistently make money. It's when you build a toolkit that allows you to confidently trade any given market condition. The cool part is, aren't that many of them market goes up market goes down market goes sideways volatility goes up volatility goes down volatility clusters. Right. That's what you got. So the really cool part about trading in general is that there's a bunch of different ways you can go about it, but the reality is you're starting from a pretty decent jump point, which knowing those different ways that the market can make money.

Casadoro says you continue to drop quality info and really stand out. You do not have enough subs. So many more should be learning from you. That's awesome to hear. Thank you so much for saying that. That kind of stuff is really encouraging because I obviously want you guys to learn as much as you can. And I want to try to help people learn, but to be honest, that's also why I think our community is right sized. It's because the majority of traders get into the world of trading thinking it's going to be fast easy money and it's simply not. So that's actually why you'll see other YouTubers in general. They will essentially just try to monetize their audience by using what we all know is clickbait, but it's for the kind of people that touch those kinds of things and they have those hopes of fast easy money and stuff like that. Our community is very specific and it's actually our community members that taught me this. I didn't even know this, which is the people that find their way into the outlier community typically are people that have been trading for a little bit understand that this is actually kind of difficult, but they're interested in putting in the effort to learn.

But the content in that video is good and I'm comfortable with the content of that video. So the way I look at that is not wow, that sucks only 185 people watch this. I look at this as 185 people got to watch something that I actually think is good usable information. It was about volatility. So yeah, it's a it's a really interesting problem set for me to be honest because you can see how in why creators turn to the clickbait stuff. But I don't think it excuses it. I think that's I think it's a perversion of morals to be honest and everybody has their objectives, but mine rest a little bit different. Lauren says I didn't see that yet.

    "text": "I dropped the link in here. But for those that don't know what I'm doing is on on Thursdays. I'm starting a segment that's essentially I'm calling it outlier trading quick tips. And the whole point is a lot of what I do is kind of heavier stuff. So the goal for the quick tip segment is to give people shorter videos that teach pretty dense stuff in a condensed time frame. Now this last one I'm not going to lie. It was a little bit longer than I wanted it to be. It was like 13 minutes. I'm trying to keep on under eight minutes. That's the goal going forward. So Chris says, Hey, Eric, do you have any videos on debit spreads for zero DTSP X trading? I don't I don't trade those at all myself. I don't really think that there's a lot of efficacy behind that personally. So I don't. And now by the way is the perfect time. If you have questions, if you have anything that you want to talk about feel free to start throwing it in there. We're at about an hour. I'm going to go through the rest of these questions just because I don't want to leave people hanging but I'll go a little bit quicker. Next one says, could you provide some guidance reading material and how to get started with the option trading in a manner that's compatible with the full time job. That's a great question. I",

I actually think that this was a veteran that sent this to me. Grabbing options is a strategic investment and just working through that entire book. I really think that that's the easiest way to do it. The way that I would structure it in my mind is I would pretend that I'm back in college. And this is the required reading for this semester. Right. It's like if you apply that kind of discipline, you can get through a pretty big book like that in a reasonable timeframe. If we take a look. This book is getting out of the glossary, getting out of the graphs. Axes which are great. So the book is 978 pages. How long is the semester? I don't even remember. When I was at RIT, we did semesters my like super senior year because before that we were actually on quarters. So I actually don't even know how long a semester is. Like is it six six? No, not six months. How long is the semester? Anyways, I'll start doing a math problem here though. And then you guys can tell me how long a semester is somebody will know that. So 987. If you",

So the point is even a book that's a thousand pages long. If you break it up into a smaller problem set, it takes you less than three months to complete. 10 pages a day is it's literally child's play. Right. It's literally child's play. It's just a function of consistency. The policy says six months. Oh, it is six months. Thank you. I actually I genuinely didn't know. So for somebody with a full time job, it's exactly how I would start. I would give the problem set that simple of a starting point so that you can gain momentum and keep crushing it. Alright, next one. This is also from Reddit. I actually didn't read this one. I'm just wondering though, is there any hope for small accounts, not of course to trade full time, but maybe one day. My day job doesn't make me much money, but I can afford to lose some for investing. Yeah, there's of course.

The thing to remember with a small account is that your job with a small account is to learn the skill set. That's your job. The prospects of growing a really small account into a really big account is very low. But a lot of the stuff that you learn trading a small account applies directly to a big account. Chris says, do you still stay in touch with Newton? It's a great question. So I texted him at 2132 last night. And then he texted me back at 0613 this morning and we went back and forth for a little bit. So he and I still talk. I mean, at least every week, we we bullshit back and forth. So yeah, I talked to Newton quite a lot. He's I like him a lot. The thing that I like so much about Newton is it's not even from like a game stop or a trading perspective. Now that's one of the cool things about him is that I met him through game stop, which is very cool. But he's so different than me. And you guys have to understand how much I love that.

How do you find the right stock to trade this is a good question. This becomes so much easier.

And it stems from. And it's naturally limit your choices based on what you're looking for a great example of this is let's say I'm trying to play an earnings. Going back to that example from Paulo earlier if I'm trying to play earnings it tells me that unless earnings happen to align with an up in options. So I'm trying to get the option up X that I essentially need something that has weak lease in order for me to get the actual exposure that I want it's a natural filter that's going to knock out the most of the tradable universe there's only like 500 and something stocks 538 or some that have weekly options so that's how you find the right stuff to trade is you start with something like the outlier strategy process which is literally just a framework",

And then you define the profit mechanism you define the signals and then when you search for those signals that fit the profit mechanism it's going to back you into the kind of stocks or just securities that fit the idea. So that's info is the most important to know. I mean that's such a big question. It's such a big question. I think the most important information to know is the profit mechanism. Like if I had to pick something it's the profit mechanism because if you thoroughly understand the profit mechanism then the worst you can do is pick something that's sub optimal to capture it but you still would make money in that scenario if you firmly understand profit mechanisms. So I think that's the most important thing to know profit mechanism. Recommendation on understanding tax implications or softwares or should I need to go to a CPA. I think if your it I mean trading itself is not that complex the reporting process for trading can be done I used to do my own taxes I think it really depends on your broader tax footprint to be completely honest.

I think if your it I mean trading itself is not that complex the reporting process for trading can be done I used to do my own taxes I think it really depends on your broader tax footprint to be completely honest. So I think what I can tell you is that a CPA becomes worth their weight in gold as you make more money unequivocally because the main thing is as taxes get more complex with more components to it. The broader expert expertise is just so worth it I happily pay a lot of money for really my my team of people that help me which one of them is a really solid CPA. I also think having a really good attorney that can help you again once you start having larger assets it's really good to have that kind of expertise. If you're a smaller retail trader it's just a pass through amount right so if you're trading short term you're going to be taxed at your nominal tax rate. If you're holding things longer than here you get long term capital gains tax you can attempt to hit DTS day trading status. And if you do that then you can elect for something like Mark to market which will change your tax profile a little bit allowing things like wash sales but you get a consolidate at 1099 from your broker which essentially is telling you exactly what to input.

So yeah I think if you have simple broader taxes you can do them yourself if you have a more complex tax picture then CPAs are entirely worth it completely completely worth it. And then the last one here is why is there so little accountability for what people say on air or right even in the finance world. The share amount of noise is useless slash non actionable stats like this spy is down a whole one percent today due to XYZ. The reason for this is actually funny and you have yourself to blame that's the reality it's because a lot of people really like entertainment they like to be entertained. So in order to get people to click in and to watch stuff they essentially need to entertain so if the collective behavior and preferences of investors and traders changed so that we weren't clicking into whatever this thing is or these kinds of things then they would change what they produce.

So with YouTube the the three things that I have written on my board over here are fear curiosity and desire and the reality is fear unfortunately works really well and it's because people are highly fearful of a lot of different things and people will continue to be fearful so I'm going to do it again. So honestly Chris it's another one of those things you really shouldn't be that disappointed in the youtubers you should be disappointed in your peers the people that click the video because if those people don't click that video then that video stars and dies because those are the people that are actually trying to make a living off of YouTube which I I understand and I respect that i'm really fortunate and that I don't have to do that but if I had to make my living through YouTube. Because that was going to be my essential professional way to to make a living then my job is a youtuber is to serve the audience what they want and that's reality is whether people overtly acknowledge it or not it is",

    "text": "I had to make my living through YouTube. Because that was going to be my essential professional way to to make a living then my job is a youtuber is to serve the audience what they want and that's reality is whether people overtly acknowledge it or not it is what they want and it's displayed through their action. Which is I think sad but yeah it's another one of those things we have nobody other than ourselves to blame unfortunately and as what it is a. Now I will say that I do think that there's room for morals and integrity and I do think people do stretch them sometimes for the sake of getting a click so even though I think that the audience might favor something demand something have a preference for something like the creator isn't forced to do that but they are. I'm not pressured to do that if they're attempting to make a living off of this is this is another thing I honestly see all the time I don't have any courses but a lot of people will try to talk shit about courses and they'll say well if anybody is successful then they wouldn't have a course such a dumb statement it really is fucking dumb that book that I just picked up Lawrence Macmillan options is a strategic investment that dude's been in markets for a long time.

There's a reality why do you think Warren Buffett is sitting on so much cash he's sitting on so much cash because it's difficult for him to find things to get invested in that makes sense for the size of the portfolio it's difficult for bigger accounts you actually start to get phased out of a lot of things that you're trying to trade you can't do that. I can't actually put them on in the size that you want because then the market starts to detect it in front run the move especially for stuff like options because options whether you believe it or not you really care about the price quite a lot because you're making a pretty specific bet with respect to price so those thought processes are always so interesting to me from like a person's perspective and a lot of things that I've learned have come from the market.

It's like just a fundamental misunderstanding literally of the fucking world in how things work but yeah really really interesting the main thing though that I always remind people of is our decisions and what we choose to interact with has a massive impact on what's provided to us. As long as people keep clicking on those fear mongering bullshit links and stuff like that they're going to keep making them and it's a unfortunate reality but it is what it is the cool part is is you don't have to click them I essentially consume very little finance media like very very little most of what I learned from finance comes from feeds that get with from wire feeds not from like seeking alpha position posts.

Yeah I was trading just some of these run ups been a long time since I've touched it but that's nuts. This is a really really interesting example of just a company that was positioned pretty well but it just fucked it all up. Take a look at this man like the stock was several hundred dollars and just ground down and it's literally at 35 cents. Fucking crazy. A policy you ever use whale alerts. I use unusual options activity not necessarily whale alerts and the reason why is because unusual options activity takes a lot of different forms and it's very contextual but a lot of times people will see what they consider to be whales right big positions and they'll think that it means something and it's very difficult to tell. If an individual big person placing a trade really means anything so yeah now we did talk about yesterday those vix positions",

    "text": "lot of times people will see what they consider to be whales right big positions and they'll think that it means something and it's very difficult to tell. If an individual big person placing a trade really means anything so yeah now we did talk about yesterday those vix positions that went on did we not. Interesting but that's also not one individual position that went on and I told you guys that I was following along with some of them because unusual options activity can be very informative but like whale alerts on individual big trades and stuff like that I don't really care about those quite as much to be completely honest with you. What did we learn today we learned a couple things the first thing I think that we can summarize here is. The typical duration and learning path or in in straighter. We also learned strategy building and role of planning and trading and then the third thing that we learned. I think I want to kind of combine five six and seven. I think these are fine I think these two capture everything. And then I'm going to hop off so that I can build your quays next week. As always if you guys need anything let me know be an outlier I will see you all.",
