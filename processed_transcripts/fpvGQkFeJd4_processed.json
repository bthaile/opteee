Like I don't really talk about this at all because I don't want to talk about this particular question because I don't want to get off track most of the time. This is different. It's podcast. I don't talk about this the network, but this is a question that I've been battling in turn myself and trying to try and decide how to address it for a long time. What's up everyone. Welcome back to the outlier podcast. We have a familiar face. I mean, a familiar face from a bunch of places at this point. People see you every single day, but we have a Tom back. Great to see you again. Thanks. Thanks for having me. So last time we spoke, I was a few months ago, I tried to catch up with you like every few months just to see how things are going and what's materializing. And we were obviously talking about the new, just dynamic of markets economy, that kind of stuff. And I know you're not like that into the economy, like a data perspective in terms of how it informs your trading, but I still find this stuff fascinating.

How is it playing out in your general world view and the economy might the way I look at it is they're intertwined. They're different, but they're still intertwined and they reflect one another in different ways. The stock market is playing out surprisingly a lot like I thought it would. I thought it'd be the first half of this year. And I didn't think we were going much of anywhere this year. So I think that the lows surprised me, the lows surprised me, but being down on the year. And I thought we'd kind of, you know, between 5,500 and 57, 50, I thought that's kind of where we're going to spend most of the year. So that part of it doesn't really surprise me. So stock market wise, I think I'm in line. I think that's pretty wise. I guess I'm not sure that that I mean, thinking about the economy just as from just a very like the 500 foot view, I'm surprised how well we have settled for the insanity of this administration.

It's bothersome that we have accepted it the way we have. So for me, that's the biggest surprise. I don't think, I don't, I wouldn't say it's like an economic surprise. If I had to pick one part of the markets that probably is a surprise, maybe it's maybe it's where the bond market is, maybe it's interest rates right now more than it stocks or anything else. But I think in general, it's that the markets held up reasonably well given the amount of I think self-inflicted concerns and conflicts that I have about, you know, what's happening in what's happening in politics. Got it. Now talk to me about the initial drop, the way that that played out because I, the news component to its interesting, you're talking about some of the polls, you know, elements who, which is interesting. So did anything stand out about that drop, velocity, duration, recovery, anything like that? Well, of course, I mean, anytime you get a move of that, I mean, that was basically a crash.

I, I, I don't like playing for outlier moves. The same way I don't like betting that don't. I think that, you know, up to two standard deviations is a very reasonable expectation. One standard deviation has a high probability of a touch. Two standard deviations has a much lower chance, but that's where the whole financial industry lives. And I think that that's a reasonable place to set expectations inside of. When we get outside of that, it gets confusing. And that's, I think, you know, anytime, like what recently happened in April, we got outside of two standard deviations, that's confusing. Now talks to me about the confusion, though, because we know, we know it's going to be confusing. And I imagine that there's got to be some sort of approach that you would take to at least moderately adapt, given the circumstance. So you certainly, you certainly can try, but you have to give it a fair analogy. Anytime you're in a kind of like a crash, you know, just think of yourself in a, in a bad, in a bad situation, you're driving down the road and there's a patch of ice, you know, it's black ice. You can't see it. So your car spins. There, there's not a lot you can do.",

But when I find things are as unpredictable as they are, I almost feel like I use the term loosely, but like levels the playing field because I feel like if we're in a standard bull market, you have really smart analysts, really big institutions able to position super well, not that you're directly competing with them all the time.

I would say this year, earnings plays, you know, being short some premium on the earnings place has been probably, has been very good and sticking with sticking with some, contrarian directional place has also been very good for me. So like in other words, you know, like I was just as an example, I was bearish on a dollar. So from the beginning, from last year, and so sticking with those positions and, you know, not giving up on things like that have been, have been probably the best trade of the year. In addition to like various earnings, short premium earnings plays things like that. The most challenging thing this year has been trying to recover from being short a lot of premium going into the whole meltdown in April. Yeah, that's, yeah, that's been the challenge.

Watch me more about that. So going into the meltdown again at a high level was the portfolio, I assume for you, probably net short deltas and short premium or I was short delta and short premium, but you don't need a very big down move to lose your short deltas. So you know, I was short deltas at at 6,000 at 57 or 5800, you end up long deltas. We went down to 4800. So the challenge was trying to stay relatively neutral and it's very difficult to do when Valetold is exploding because your short calls don't really help you against your short puts. So that was, that was the biggest challenge of the year so far. And you know, coming back from that has been, you know, that's, we're still, we're still fighting that battle.

And so I think that, you know, and, and we don't know the internal damage that's been caused, you know, by this trust factor because there's no way that the rest of the world looked at us like we had their back no matter what. It's clear now we don't have their back and they're never going to look at us that way again. So the question becomes how much money flows into America, you know, how much, how much goodwill flows into the US and our markets, can our markets sustain these levels without the same level of goodwill and capital and everything else. And I don't know the answer yet. Nobody does. It's interesting. That's an interesting perspective because I definitely don't share part of it. The part I'd like to double click into is the idea because I do agree completely with the destabilization by the way and just the way that this whole thing is gone has caused a bit of a ruckus. Sure. But even through that, it does seem like there's a clear line that we're trying to negotiate and talk with partners.

And so I get it, you know, that's that's scary part. And that's why I think the integrity of the markets is so important. So talk to me about some of the ways that you think retail trader though could get more comfortable with taking risk and accepting of losses. I mean, one thing you can do is you can control your own investments as opposed to letting somebody else do it because when somebody else does it, you have no control over the correlation risk in your portfolio. So all you, all you know is that that person may put you into 10 different stocks, but they all might be highly correlated to an extent of that it doesn't matter, you know,",

    "text": "when somebody else does it, you have no control over the correlation risk in your portfolio. So all you, all you know is that that person may put you into 10 different stocks, but they all might be highly correlated to an extent of that it doesn't matter, you know, markets going to do whatever the market does, it goes down, you're going to lose on all of them. If the market goes up, you're going to make on all of them. But, but point being is that, you know, there is, there's nothing you can do to control their risk. The alternative is that if you do it yourself, you can put yourself in a handful of different investments and you can keep your size so you can control whatever it is. You control the decision making when you open the trade. So you control what you put your money into and after that, market forces take over. As opposed to the only thing you control is just who you give your money to, which I think I don't like that. So it sounds like there's a baked in element here though because my assumption would be for people a lot of times when they're seeking external controls that they're seeking external expertise because they're not comfortable with their own awareness or knowledge around the thing. Right, right. Right. It's exactly it. There's a certain amount of, you know, they're nervous. There's, they're nervous about their level of know-how.",

One of them is you guys talk a lot about sizing things, controlling risk on the onset, which I think helps a lot with that.

No, not 95. 95 of the people don't become, you know, multi millionaires or billionaires or that. But 50 of the people are way better off than everybody else. And because they've learned how to take risk and take shots and do whatever. The other thing I honestly would expect you to say and I don't know if this is accurate, but I also would imagine that you would think that the people in the bottom 50 that took the shot and failed still would probably be better off after taking the shot and failing. Of course. Yeah. And listen, there's going to be, there's going to be a certain percentage. Maybe it's 15 or whatever that take the shot that learned the risk that never recover. That we would be, it would be foolish for us to sit here and say that that doesn't happen because it absolutely does. And you know, that's the unfortunate part.

And if you were to give that group of people some guidance in terms of what instead to focus on in order to leverage the experience of taking the risk, but to turn it into something more practical longer term, what kind of guidance would you give that person? Well, because the, the 5,000 is, I mean, there have been people that have turned 5,000 into our ridiculous amount of money. But the statistical chance of doing that is, is minuscule. I did an interview with somebody once he turned, he was, he was, an engineer and he turned a 3,000 count into about, I think, about seven and a half million. Literally a 3,000 count.

So, it sounds like this can help frame some of that, which is really cool, I think. Yeah, we get hung up on on P and L.

Before the year started, I thought we would close the year at about 5700. We're at 5859, not 5900 tonight. But and I only felt like that because I thought that after, you know, a crazy run up to the last, whatever you want to say, 15 years, you know, maybe we needed a little bit of a pullback. I expect, I think the damage has been done this year, meaning the Vol spike in April, I think was a very important, you know, high in volatility and a high in risk and probably a low in the market. So I don't think the 4800, 5000 levels going to be going to be retested this year. And I also think that there's enough skepticism out there and and valid reasons for that skepticism. And I also think with the bonds at 113 right now, there is, you know, I don't see us going to new highs anytime soon. So I think we're in a trading range.

And and I, I would expect that, you know, suggesting that we could be range bound between 6000 and 50400 is probably pretty reasonable. And what do you think of all hanging around the 18 handle?

It's about, it's about 10 elevated right now. I mean, I, I think that all traders prefer 20 to 22 in a perfect world, 20 to 25, but 2022 is cool. 18 is the low end of the preferred range, but it's way better than 16. You know, in, in Trump's first term, 2017, which was the first, which would be like an equivalent year till 2025, we didn't even have a 1 move all year. It was the worst year ever for volatility. So I was worried this year, you know, that there might be a low in volatility, but clearly that has not been the case.
