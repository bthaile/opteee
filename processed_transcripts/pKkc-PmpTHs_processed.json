    "text": "The number one thing options aren't is a easy way to make X number of dollars per day per week or per month. It is bullshit. You are just seeing good marketing because they are praying on a psychological component. We want to believe that something is easy, able to make us good money without a lot of effort. The problem is it doesn't exist. We know it doesn't exist, but we make them mentally leave anyways because we want it to be true. This is disingenuous marketing. Options are great products. I mean, advocate for them. I've traded them for 16 years and they've made me wealthy. I like them. The problem is it's such bullshit to present them to people as these super simple things and the only thing it does is set people up for failure. Once you get over the learning curve, they are very simple to deploy. It doesn't make them easy. You gotta get over that learning curve first and accept the challenge. Be an dollar sale later.",
