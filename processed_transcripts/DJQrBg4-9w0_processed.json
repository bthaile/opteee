    "text": "One of the things I do in the free outlier discord, which linked to in the description, is ask what people are struggling with. What stuff do you want to see a video on because I do not make content for the sake of the algorithm or performing well, clearly most of my videos don't, but actually to share information. So, this was a great question. And this says, I'm curious, what do you use, what you do with the data in your logs, and this context, trade logs, which I talk a lot about, what story your data telling you, how do you analyze it, so on and so forth? And it's a great question. And it's really simple to answer because the first thing that I look for in a trade log is what are the extremes? Meaning is there anything that jumps out at me when I'm looking at an individual strategy or cross strategies is one, grossly performing better than the other. I always start at the tails and then slowly click and you can learn a lot of information in all of your sailor.",
