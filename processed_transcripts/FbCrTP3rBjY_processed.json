You just went with the plain green. I kind of like mixed green going on, but yeah, it's good to see you again. How's everything? I don't think I would blend in the way you would. I think your ears would be slightly more effective probably, but this is the color of money. Yeah, I was just going to say that's like a candle stick chart. Like I literally just want to create your head and your green candle. Yeah. So maybe that's your Halloween costume idea. Or yeah, the kids will love that. I was going to say what are your kids going to make you be? Oh, I don't know. I usually don't. I'd like to hand out candy. That's my thing. I'll hang out at your kids. Your kids go. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, I have no idea. We have not even talked about Halloween costumes here. I have no clue. Oh, look at me. I'm crazy. I know it's. We're a family that waits the last minute on one. I was just thinking more sort of like all the ideas. Like there's a lot of positive for you. Like that I think. Yeah. That would be pretty, pretty epically hilarious, but I think it would be the top of my list.",

Let, let, let, you know, you ask lots of questions. I'm going to ask you a lot of questions on this one. Where do you think we're at with inflation? I already asked that. So then I'll respond. You're my guest. I mean, you know, the numbers, it looks inflation is almost gone at this point. Interesting interpretation. It doesn't mean that shit's not way more expensive than it was two years ago. See, inflation is the growth rate, right? It's not, it's not the price level. So it's the thing that, that economists focus on is how are prices changing? Right. And, and today, you know, if you look at, you know, as we spoke about after the Fed meeting on the live stream, right? If you, if you look at what the Fed sees, they see, they're at it.

But a lot of the numbers that you look at, you know, let's talk more holistically though. Do you think where we are in or going into a recession in I don't know the next six months? Next six, I would classify it lower probability. I would say next 12 higher probability, almost 50, 50, I would call it. Okay. So I think that's a more interesting question, because I think inflation is not something that lives in isolation. And if you look at the jobs numbers, the jobs numbers, I think, are, are, are flashing now. I think there's a red light that's flashing because the headline numbers look good. And it's primarily due to seasonal adjustments, which normally makes sense. And normally that's that you have to adjust time series for seasonality. But those kinds of adjustments tend to break down as you are transitioning, like from one state to another, you know, if you're transitioning from economic growth to recession, then, you know, those seasonal adjustments aren't always as accurate.

And, you know, I think, and I'm sort of, I think I agree with you. I might even be a bit more negative on the odds of recession. I think the Fed waited so long that they might have pushed us into recession in the nearer term. But again, I'm not an economist.

And we're also seeing, you know, I mean, I'm really interested, so sort of hear your perspective on volatility. You know, I just saw this great article in the Wall Street Journal today that VIX 45 calls expiring next, you know, in eight days are going nuts.

They locked into the 45s for 16 oct? Yeah. Call options outstanding tied to the VIX with the 45 strike. Open interest went from like 100,000 to over 300,000. Oh, I was looking at the volume because calls today, trends like traded super heavy, it was like 413,000, but I was a little more surprised actually at the 20 handle or the 25, I think, let me look. Yeah, the 16 oct 25s, they had 32,000 volume today, compared to the 45s which were at 21,000 in the 40s, I see it 12. That's interesting that they unden on those. Curious. Yeah, what does that mean? What do you, when you see that, what, what, what's your interpretation? I mean, expansion and volatility, now whether or not it's a direct play, I doubt that for most of them, I have to imagine a majority of these is hedging a broader portfolio of some sort. And the duration is peculiar, but my guess is, I haven't looked at the calendar for the next seven days into next week, but my guess is there's stuff next week that the market is pricing right now.

So what is it, the week of the 13th, and those are the 16 oct, which is strange, the 16 oct is strange, I guess it's the only next expiration, so it could encompass CPI, PPI that's coming out later this week. So that's probably going to be jobless claims, CPI. And then what's yeah, yeah, next week, there's a holiday. I'm guessing it's not. Other jobless games, housing starts, yeah, doesn't look like anything extraordinary. Yeah, so I have to guess it's the Fed meeting minutes on the ninth, PPI, PPI, because those are going to move things quite a lot. That's my expectation at least. We can also, if inflation comes in hot, then Fed's going to not cut. Well, did you see the market really? Before we move on to the cut and the Fed watch tool, I threw into chat GPT out of curiosity. I wanted to know the purchasing power of one Canadian dollar in 19 versus 24. And it's 83.22 cents. Does that sound right to you? In 19, what do you mean? 2019, comparing it to 2024. So meaning, if",

So let, let me pull this down super fast for this tool. And then we can take a look at this together, because I like now you kind of have me pretty curious. Okay, here we go. So we can look at what the build out in VIX is looked like. And then let's just look at today. And then I need to get rid of some of these fields. Okay. So right now I'm sorting this by premium. So here's 16 oct. I'm only going to look at the 16 oct, which is what next Wednesday. So this, I mean, there's massive build out. Yeah, all across it. Literally everything 1921. And these are people that are buying those calls. Yeah, I mean, they didn't pay a ton, right? But that's it's pretty far out of the money. Well, for the 40 and that's the whole play for the 45. So for those that are like not super familiar, why that would go so far out of the money. It's not always because they're expecting the stock or in this case VIX to hit 45. But it's because we like you call it like building units. You can put on way more of those. And then you just essentially play gamma. But you",

So 4000 there, 3000 there, 3000 3000. So somebody is, somebody's definitely building out. I mean, you know, think about it. And the other thing to think about is that these are so far out of the money and so short term that it's highly likely that they expire worthless, right? Unless, unless either it's a hedge, in which case, doesn't matter if they expire worthless because that means that the trade you put on is doing okay. Or someone knows something.

Well, let's take a quick look at this really fast. I just want to see the probabilities, which we can use this for. So if we pop into analyze, go to probabilities. So those are the 16 oct, which is super close. Let's check out the probability of a touch. This is using one standard deviation move. The probability of getting to the Fort Lecloifs. Right. Exactly. Hold on. So it's less than it's less. Yeah, it's literally sub point 1. Yeah. It's straight up off the scale. I'd have to zoom in. Yeah. So, so you know, in most situations, all you're simply doing is handing money over to the call, the call writer in this situation. Look at this. Zero. And it doesn't even register.

You constructed every single trade. And we're like, going post by post. So I think we're on like episode like six or seven now. But we're like just getting into the 2024 stuff. And I've learned a lot of fascinating things about the way that he does stuff. Actually, that would be fun. Let me just realize like there's not too many people that I talk to that are from at least like generally familiar with options markets. And I forget that you know more about them than I do.

And so nothing in here is formatted nice. This is all just a bunch of bullshit that's cobbled together so I can see information. That's it. So the entire genesis of doing this was not to efficiently go through all of his old trades, but it was actually to like for me to physically see them go to the chart, see what it looked like at the time, right? To like really build a relationship with what it looked like was going on. And there's a couple things that I found really fascinating. The first thing is I found when analyzing all of his old options trades a really strange tendency. It was almost binary where trades were exited shockingly pretty early or shockingly very late.

So GameStop here was trading around like 369 I think. And he had 15 Jan 2021 and this is 25 now. He had 15 Jan 2021. He had 17 calls that he sold, but he kept the 20s, 15s and 10s. Long story short, as I go through a lot of these, one of the things that I noticed that I couldn't comprehend is when he was coming up on expiration, he would sell the in the money options that are deep in the money and he would leave that out of the money options on that are doing like two weeks. To me, I would almost do the opposite, especially if the out of the money's are showing a profit because obviously they're going to get ready to decay away. So my best analysis of that was if you expect a bigger move, maybe because you have a bigger position in those out of the money's compared to the in the money's. That doesn't apply. Same size. It was a thousand lot, thousand lot. You actually have a higher delta in the money. You would actually make a",

And one of the things that I find so infatuating about the cat is as I look at his stuff, there are so many departures from like what we would consider optimal money making logic right. Like another thing I can tell you definitively is that dude doesn't use stops. The other thing I can tell you definitively is that dude doesn't have profit targets because he has portfolio volatility. That's 100 over the course of two weeks right. So it's like as I look at that. It's just anomalies. It's like you have a position that's up 40 million dollars. You don't put a stop and you just just just just just go.

So if you watch his more recent live streams I actually started going back. I don't know if I mentioned this you boys obsessive. So I started listening to all of his live streams. I started from the very first one and I've been going through all of them and they're like four or five hours long. So I do it at like two and a half times speed and I just like locked in trying to listen to it. It's very but if you focus hard enough it's there. And long story short I agree with you like he's definitely even the way that he structures his trades. It's not a trader at all. And I think your analysis on the investor component is very true. The interesting part is that a lot of the trades that he started putting on later are trader style trades. They're not leaps. They're not even out six months. Some of them right. Some of them are later. Yeah. So so like in coming back you mean um no even towards saying",

An investor believes that something is going to go up right. So then if you just hold while it's going up and that's been very very much what I could see from him. And think about your cost basis right your cost basis when I say leverage I'm thinking more that you know your cost basis on the out of the money is way lower. Yeah yeah. Then on then on the in the money is right. And so if you are if you have that investor mindset and you think that it you know you're looking at something going up into the right you know 50 days to expiration you are very well convinced that it's going to be worth more over the coming weeks.

And I looked at the live streams for his portfolio at the time when he posted the yolo update. And the portfolio that he had in the live stream had a bunch of stuff in it on the names. The post in Wall Street bets was in account with just game stop. Right. So to your point because I also think that's a big part of how he maintained his risk tolerance in here is because if you view the money and there is gone and you turn 100,000 into 200 million which is still exactly right. And you kind of pull out what you want because I did track every single cash change in the account like on a total variance delta.

He used to make options markets. And I ask everybody that I know that was in that business two degree this question. So I'm super curious. When you see these kinds of orders coming in from a market making perspective. Right. So let's say his latest position where he's building into you know multiple hits two mill plus size. And it's over the course of a few days from a market making perspective. You see that. What's the what's the internalization? Are you trying to front run and like move with that order thinking it's informed? Like what's the like what is it? Oh yeah. I mean I think you're looking at it as highly informed highly toxic order right like this is an order that you are your risk as a market maker is really significant.

Even on the equity side where that if that flow becomes completely one side at all of the sudden and that thing you know it starts to go parabolic like that is a destructive force but you know the outside of those you know just handful of times that that's happened it's just a money printer really right and do you know hedging that is I don't think is that is that hard. Well especially now because I think one of the prior arguments is that they I didn't realize that we're going to start talking about I love this is great. GameStop now. One of the things that I didn't fully understand though is there's a this big perception in the community the like ape community I'm like I try to understand like what they're seeing because they they find a lot of fascinating information and I find it falls into two I find that it falls into two buckets. Some of it is like this really loosely connected 10 foil stuff and then other things there's almost like a direct connection it seems and one of the theories that they had essentially was that some of the market makers were under hedging which well your compatriots like to do that from time to time because you all be fucking greedy and when something like GameStop though is trading I have to imagine especially after 2021 they're biting the bullet and just hedging is that",
