You just went with the plain green. I kind of like mixed green going on, but yeah, it's good to see you again. How's everything? I don't think I would blend in the way you would. I think your ears would be slightly more effective probably, but this is the color of money. Yeah, I was just going to say that's like a candle stick chart. Like I literally just want to create your head and your green candle. Yeah. So maybe that's your Halloween costume idea. Or yeah, the kids will love that. I was going to say what are your kids going to make you be? Oh, I don't know. I usually don't. I'd like to hand out candy. That's my thing. I'll hang out. Your kids go. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, I have no idea. We have not even talked about Halloween costumes here. I have no clue. Oh, look at me. I'm crazy. I know it's. We're family that waits the last minute on. I was just thinking more sort of like all the ideas. Like there's a lot of. Yeah. Yeah. For you.

Let, let, let, you know, you ask lots of questions. I'm going to ask you a lot of questions on this one. Where do you think we're at with inflation? I already asked that. So then I'll respond. You're my guest. I mean, you know, the numbers, it looks, inflation is almost gone at this point. Interesting interpretation. It doesn't mean that shit's not way more expensive than it was two years ago. See, inflation is the growth rate, right? It's not, it's not the price level. So it's the thing that that economists focus on is how are prices changing? Right. And, and today, you know, if you look at, you know, as we spoke about after the Fed meeting on the live stream, right? If you, if you look at what the Fed sees, they see, they're at it. They're at it. They're at the two handle. It's on its way",

You know, does it, does it, does it affect people on a day to day basis like the cost of eggs? No, it doesn't.

Like it, it, it, it means that those prices are, are no longer increasing at the same pace that they were two years ago. And, in the meantime, the amount of money that people are earning wages is increasing. And so the question always is, is, is the increase in wages outpacing the increase in prices? And that's where you start to talk about this idea of real versus nominal inflation. And where nominal inflation might look, disconcerting real, you know, the real price level is actually, I mean, it's, it's such an inflation is so crazy. It's such a psychological thing, right?

But a lot of the numbers that you look at, you know, let's talk more holistically though. Do you think we are in or going into a recession in the list? I don't know the next six months. Next six, I would classify it lower probability. I would say next 12 higher probability, almost 50, 50, I would call it. Okay. So I think that's a more interesting question. Because I think inflation is not something that lives in isolation. And if you look at the jobs numbers, the jobs numbers, I think are, are, flashing now. I think there's a red light that's flashing. Because the headline numbers look good. And it's primarily due to seasonal adjustments, which normally makes sense. And normally that's that you have to adjust time series for seasonality. But those kinds of adjustments tend to break down as you are transitioning like from one state to another, you know, if you're transitioning from economic growth to recession, then, you know, those seasonal adjustments aren't always as accurate.

I think the Fed waited so long that they might have pushed us into a recession in the nearer term. But again, I'm not an economist. I studied it in college. And, you know, I read a lot.

And the duration is peculiar, but my, my guess is, I haven't looked at the calendar for the next seven days into next week, but my guess is there's stuff next week that the market is pricing right now. That's, that would be my inference. Let's see, that's actually a good question. I know, I'm actually going to grab a calendar now to some curious. But what is it? The week of the 13th, and those are the 16 oct, which is strange, the 16 oct is strange. I guess it's the only next expiration. So it could encompass CPI, PPI that's coming out later this week. So that's probably going to be jobless claim, CPI. And then what's, yeah, next week, there's a holiday. I'm guessing it's another jobless game, housing starts. Yeah, it doesn't look like anything extraordinary. Yeah. So I have to guess it's the Fed meeting minutes on the ninth, PPI, PPI, because those are going to move things quite a lot. That's my expectation at least. We can also, if inflation comes in hot, then feds going to not height, not cut. Well, did you see? And that's going to send the market, really. Before we move on to the cut and the fed watch tool, I threw into chat GPT out of curiosity. The, I wanted to know the purchasing power of one Canadian dollar in 19 versus 24. And it's 83.22 cents.

Maybe someone knows something because that's big. This is actually one of the ways. This is one of the ways that I traded the last rate hike. The first one, I guess I should say, is because when you use the aggregated probabilities tool, oh, no, I'm sorry, the historical. When you use the historical probabilities tool, you can look at the variants in probabilities over for previous periods. And when I was watching Tuesday, it was zero. Right. Wow.

That's pretty far out of the money, right? But that's those print. Which is units. What's that? This is somebody trying to build units. Yeah.

So for example, one of the ones that I haven't been able to put my finger on and I don't understand is these sets of trades here. So GameStop here was trading around like 369 I think. And he had 15 Jan 2021 and this is 25 Nove. He had 15 Jan 2021. He had 17 calls that he sold, but he kept the 20s, 15s and 10s. Long story short, as I go through a lot of these, one of the things that I noticed that I couldn't comprehend is when he was coming up on expiration, he would sell the in the money options that are deep in the money. And he would leave that out of the money options on that are doing like two weeks. To me, I would almost do the opposite, especially if the out of the money's are showing a profit because obviously they're going to get ready to decay way. So my best analysis of that was if you expect a bigger move, maybe because you have a bigger position in those out of the money's compared to the money's. You get more leverage on them, right?

You get more leverage on them, right? That doesn't apply. Same size. It was a thousand lot, thousand lot. You actually have a higher delta in the money. You would actually make a gross, better amount of money by keeping the in the money's. So I don't understand that. Sheeps me up at night. These are the things that you think about at 3 a.m. When you wait, these are the, I know, because you don't have kids right there. It's that and it's because I have this locked up, a obsessive personality. And one of the things that I find so infatuating about the cat is as I look at his stuff, there are so many departures from like what we would consider optimal money making logic, right? Like another thing I can tell you definitively is that dude doesn't use stops. The other thing I can tell you definitively is that dude doesn't have profit targets because he has portfolio volatility. That's 100 over the course of two weeks, right? So it's like, as I look at that, it's just anomalies. It's like you have a position that's up 40 million dollars. You don't put a stop and you just just just just go.

So I started listening to all of his live streams. I started from the very first one. And I've been going through all of them and they're like four, five hours long. So I do it at like two and a half times speed. And I just like locked in trying to listen to it. It's very, but if you focus hard enough, it's there. And long story short, I agree with you. Like he's definitely even the way that he structures his trades. It's not a trader at all. And I think your analysis on the investor component is very true. The interesting part is that a lot of the trades that he started putting on later are trader style trades. They're not leaps. They're not even out six months. Some of them. Right. Some of them later.

So then if you just hold while it's going up, and that's been very, very much what I could see from him. And think about your cost basis, right? Your cost basis. When I say leverage, I'm thinking more that your cost basis on the out of the money is way lower. Yeah. Yeah. Then on the in the money. And so if you are, if you have that investor mindset, and you think that you're looking at something going up into the right, 50 days to expiration, you are very well convinced that it's going to be worth more over the coming weeks. And if you need, if you want to close something out and raise it for another trade, maybe, you're going to sell the thing with lower profits. But who are more gross, right?

He said, you know, like this is his yellow, yellow update, right? That's what went on Wall Street Betts. And I looked at the live streams for his portfolio at the time when he posted the yellow update. And the portfolio that he had in the live stream had a bunch of stuff in it on the names. The post in Wall Street Betts was in account with just GameStop. So to your point, because I also think that's a big part of how he maintained his risk tolerance in here is because if you view the money and there is gone and you turn a hundred thousand into 200 million, which is still crazy. And you kind of pull out what you want. I did track every single cash change in the account, like on a total variance delta. So I looked at the total portfolio value changes and stuff.

When you see these kinds of orders coming in from a market making perspective, right? So let's say his latest position where he's building into multiple hits, two mill plus size. And it's over the course of a few days from a market making perspective. You see that. What's the what's the internalization? Are you trying to front run and like move with that order thinking it's informed? Like what's the like what is it? Oh, I yeah, I mean, I think you're looking at it as highly informed, highly toxic order, right? Like this is an order that you are your risk as a market maker is really significant. Now there are multiple options market makers. And so first, you know, you are likely getting hit and backing away. And so then the next ones, the one that's taking on that next chunk and then back.

And one of the theories that they had essentially was that some of the market makers were under hedging, which well, your compatriots like to do that from time to time because you all be fucking greedy. And when something like GameStop though is trading, I have to imagine, especially after 2021, they're biting the bullet and just hedging. Is that probably a fair guess or no?

Yes. I mean, I think that from a company perspective, I think, have been an excellent idea. And it gives them sustainability, sustainability, a war chest. They can weather anything at this point. They're not going out of business, right? The short thesis from a bankruptcy perspective has been taken off the table.

And, you know, I can tell you it's, it's all over the place. Well, you mean it's 10, Ken is a great guy. He's just, he's just trying to get by. I am not accusing any specific firm of anything nefarious at all. Well, I'm talking about generalities. I'll be super specific. I'm talking perfectly generally that, you know, if you look in, especially in smaller names, where there's not a lot of volume and there's not a lot of size posted. They do whatever they do whatever they want. Even better if these names, it's these stocks are like listed in multiple markets. And there's one market is less liquid than the other. You know, it's, it's, it's quite easy to control the price. And, you know, you want to sell it up here, buy it back here, sell it up here, buy it back here. You can push it around. Yeah. And so, you know, I think that, I think market makers have learned that there is sort of a base level of manipulation that they can engage in and where they can understand regulatory scrutiny because they can overpower the regulators with intellect and data and complexity.

I think absolutely. Yeah. Liquidity is everything. If you look at our podcasts with, with John Wellborne, we did a couple of them. He's a professor at Dartmouth. And this is sort of like, you know, his point is that's the root of all evil. Like, all the SEC cares about is liquidity. Nothing else matters. That's why market makers have this, short sale exemption and they don't have to leave it shares and such. It's all in the name of liquidity. And if you like, I always used to say that continuous trading is the root of all evil, but, you know, it's not quite true. But it's like they go hand in hand, right? For continuous trading, you need liquidity and you need it continuously. Whereas if you switched to something like periodic or frequent batch auctions, you can concentrate liquidity and you can concentrate, you know, real liquidity rather than, you know, this sort of phantom liquidity where they're just printing shares.

And so, you know, I think to me that's a better market structure, but it doesn't really matter because we're kind of stuck in this continuous model and nothing's going to break us out of that. What do you think? Why is that? Right? So like, if you offer that alternative and from a theoretical perspective, it generally sounds like that's better price discovery. Like, that's what that sounds like to me. Like, real orders, you think it's worth this. I think it's worth this. Let's exhaust those orders and then whatever the price is is what it is. So from like a layperson's perspective, that that sounds completely logical and reasonable. So then why not that? Too many people make too much money with the current system. As is usually the problem with trying to change it for better. You know, I mean, I think if you look at like the work that Eric Buttigieg has done, he's a professor out of the University of Chicago. He's written a couple papers on frequent batch auctions and why they're superior and what the benefits are. And he's also talked about in some of those papers, like how would you introduce that into the current system? And it's hard. It's not something that can probably happen naturally or simply.

It's something that, you know, it's sort of, there's this, if you just have like one spot over here where you have these auctions, they are offered by certain providers. But then you have this entire market over here, 99 of which is continuous trading. It's very difficult to attract the liquidity into the auctions so that they really start to provide material outcomes. That's the issue. It's very much like a prisoner's dilemma. Interesting. When you look at a couple more questions before I let you skid that all I know you have, well, I mean, you probably have like important shit to do, but I always enjoy the ability to just ask dumb questions for a while. But taking this back to GameStop, what do you think the manipulation, like prospects are for something like that? Because GameStop, I find, is a little bit of an anomaly because it's not super liquid. It's super volatile. It's heavily traded. So I think of like these different factors that kind of weigh out differently. And I try to think of like how much could a market maker manipulate something like that? Any thoughts?

When I talked about it being liquid earlier, it was really more strictly from the perspective of like an options market maker who needs to hedge. But a lot of the liquidity has been sucked out of the name because of DRS and a lot of the holders are long-term holders. So it's kind of a really funky and weird situation. And I think anytime something doesn't trade a lot, it can be manipulated more easily than something it does obviously. But there are so many eyes on it. It seems like there's more risk in doing that at the same time. There's a lot of money involved as well. Right. I look at stuff like even the base stock volume though. So right now there's what? Well, think your swim is telling me 446,000 or 446 million shares. I don't know if that's accurate or not, but just taking that at face value. That's the audience shares. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah.

Last question before you wrap, any new exciting up and coming from Irvin or from just stuff you're working on? Yeah. I mean, Irvin is doing some interesting things. And I encourage you all to go check out Irvin.finance and join the conversation there. You know, it's there's some good, good investment ideas on the platform. People doing research. It's neat to see a big part of what we're focusing on is connecting public companies to their investors. But as I told you before we started this today, it became public that we, the investors are advocacy effort and Irvin have sued the SEC over the final reg NMS rule that was adopted a couple weeks ago. So I can't really say much at this juncture on it, but I've never sued the SEC before. So it'll be a learning experience for everybody. It's going to be a learning experience. Yeah. Super interesting. One question on that. And again, if you can't answer, obviously shut it down. But I'm curious like what, what was the thought process leading into that? Like, obviously, there's a culmination point, right, where there's something happens, something happens, something happens. And then at some point, there's a, okay, fuck this, we need to do something. What was like that culmination point? Yeah. Right.
