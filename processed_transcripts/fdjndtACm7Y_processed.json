    "text": "What's up outliers? I want to talk to you about a trade in CCJ where I used unusual options activity in conjunction with a thematic idea to effectively make over 200 return on the option itself. And it was about 160 return on a VESA capital so far, the trade's not fully over yet. So I'm going to talk to you about what the idea was, how I found it, those kinds of things. And I want to start by setting the table with you all. And this is the position we're going to be talking about. The first thing to know is that I've scaled this position so that it's similar sizing in my actual portfolio, but using the 600,000 model portfolio. I'm trying to put everything in a common language. So effectively what this is is essentially saying, if this trade was part of this portfolio, this would be the relative sizing used, which ended up being 12,600 position for 50 lots. This represents about a 2 position, which in my actual portfolio, this trade was larger, but this is the same relative size. So that is we talk about the model portfolio and stuff like that, all of this carries over. Because the actual dollars amounts, it none of it matters. That's why I'm not spending time showing like the actual position. It doesn't actually matter. I know that it's fun for like gain porn and seeing numbers, but I care so much more about talking about",

I know that it's fun for like gain porn and seeing numbers, but I care so much more about talking about the process. So I think it's useful to keep everything in that context. So let's start with the broader theme. And let's listen to a few seconds of this. This is from a few months ago. From President-elect Donald Trump, that he wants to drill baby drill, but it's unclear if oil executives actually want to increase production while President-elect Trump has said that he wants to gut the inflation reduction act. So nuclear could actually be the biggest energy beneficiary for a few reasons. First of all, so you heard it, and I think this is actually a pretty decent summary. The positioning for nuclear power is very strong. So it put it on a watch list for me. And it's something that I knew that we were going to see policy eventually announced around. And when we would see that policy, there likely was going to be a interesting change in price. So we're going to talk about this trade in the context of the outlier trade process. And I will throw a link to this video in the notes below. But this is effectively the major steps I go through mentally as I'm putting on a trade.",

But this is effectively the major steps I go through mentally as I'm putting on a trade. So I feel it relevant to talk about the trade in the context of this process. So I have different positions on in nuclear power themed trades right now. But and even in CCGI, multiple positions on. But I'm actually focusing on a specific subset of those positions. And it's because the entry for this series of trades was fueled again by unusual options activity, which is kind of fun to look at. And it helps me create a tie-in, actually, for something I regularly use, but combining it with thematic play. So again, ticker here with CCGI, and it's because they produce uranium. And they're very successful at it. They're one of the primary producers that we see. And with all of the domestication of things that the US is going through, it seems like this company would be pretty well positioned. And this is more for a longer term idea. Again, this is the backdrop. The way that my brain works is, I like to create different themes that I'm paying attention to, and that as they see opportunities emerge in those themes, I'm ready to bounce on them.

The way that my brain works is, I like to create different themes that I'm paying attention to, and that as they see opportunities emerge in those themes, I'm ready to bounce on them. So this started not as a portfolio need, but an opportunity. So again, for my general screening process, I want to know, do I have something specific? I need to put into the portfolio, do I need long delta short delta's, long premium short premium, long data adoption, short data options, all that kind of stuff, not a little polite. This was entirely driven by an opportunity as I saw it emerging. So for some general context in CCGI, if we look out over the last three-year time frame, we can see that it's in a pretty aggressive growth phase. However, it had a massive sell-off, essentially from late 2024, and then it started bottoming around April. So the longer term trades that I'm using, not gonna go into detail on those here, but actually started following earnings, and it's using essentially two breakout periods from the second of May, and then also on the sixth of May. But again, that's not what we're gonna discuss today. We're actually gonna discuss a trade that started on the 14th. And the 14th kind of quasi breakout, but again, it was the options component that led to the idea. So this is a broader thematic upside play in nuclear energy. The",

The profit mechanism in this trade is gonna be direction. And the stuff that I was looking for really helped me identify momentum, drift, and positioning. And again, we're gonna spend time looking at the actual options positioning that peaked my interest. The trade itself was gonna start with long calls, and in the back of my mind, it has the ability to turn into a ratio called diagonal. Again, I have other positions on that already exhibit or the ratio called diagonal side. So this one was really designed to be a little bit shorter term again because of the options in just following the options flow. So this position was going to be managed not by time, meaning duration and trade. More so based on movement. However, if enough time passed and the trade wasn't doing what I thought it should, then I would have exited. So the actual trade that went on was super simple on the 14th of May, CCJ was about 52.53.

This is a little bit different than when I'm typically trying to size these trades because if I'm going to go that far to the money a lot of times, I'm actually going to be closer in time. However, this is mostly where I saw better liquidity, which is what led me into that strike versus something that was a slightly higher delta. So this represents a 12,600 debit. And again, this is a little bit large for a speculative trade based on what I typically would do. Normally it would be less than a percent. However, in this context, I went for a little bit larger because of slightly higher eviction. And the risk in the trade was defined by the size. I wasn't expecting to realize that full 2 loss if I started seeing not accommodating price behavior, but that is what I was prepared to lose based on the trade.

So what led to the original entry, it's actually kind of interesting. And I have some screenshots here to show you. We'll take a look on the platform, but I really want you to just pay attention to the net premiums. And notice what happens on this day. You see how there's just this massive spike in positive call premium. So people that are buying calls. And then you also see that there's kind of a drop the next day in put premium, meaning that these are people selling puts. Overall, very interesting positioning. And this is what originally caught my eye. Again, it wasn't just this. It's this in conjunction with the broader theme that I'm paying attention to. The reason why I'm making that point is because this in and of itself would not lead to an entry for me, but it's this in conjunction with that broader idea.

    "text": "the platform really quick. And let's take a look specifically at two things. I want to show you what the options chain actually looks like. And it's for two different things, but I want to show you broader skew. So if we take a look and we rank this by premium. And we take a look over the next couple of explorations. Now this is on the 27th of May. This is after some of the move has started. So this was a little more pronounced leading into the release. But notice how strong the call premium is relative to the put premium to 136,000 in put premium compared to 1.7 million on the call side. This is for this coming expiration 30th of May. Then if we go out to the next expiration, you can see still really big call premium skew. And then again, really big call premium skew. And so on and so forth. So this skew had been present for some time, as I was looking at it. So then the other thing I'm monitoring is the percent change in open interest. And again, this is after the move a little bit. So we're starting to see this winding down to a degree day over day. But this was also really pronounced. So then what I do is I say, OK, I'm seeing interesting positioning going on coming into what might be some sort of known release of information. At this point, when I put on",

So then what I do is I say, OK, I'm seeing interesting positioning going on coming into what might be some sort of known release of information. At this point, when I put on the trade on the 14th of May, the executive orders that Trump announced had not been announced yet, because that was on the 23rd. So it's still kind of quiet. But I can see this positioning going on. Then if I take a look at the actual options feed from the 14th of May, and I'm looking at the call side, I notice that the 60s are getting hit a lot. And most of the larger trades are being bought, which is bullish in nature. So I'm seeing this pretty strong positive build out based on options premium, which, again, all of that ends up leading to my entry into that trade. Now, interestingly enough, the position itself really didn't need to be held for that long. I had originally targeted just outside 5775 in CCJ. That's not where I'm actually going to exit, but it's where I'm going to set profit taking. And the reason for that is because it's outside this next volume node. So this is where the original entry was. And then my expectation was hold as it's rallying. And then the original profit target taking would be, again, about 5775, downside risk management, again, fully",

And then the original profit target taking would be, again, about 5775, downside risk management, again, fully defined by the size of the trade, but would have been starting to scale out or below the 48 and a half handle as it fell below this point of control. So it's just a pure directional play. So then we got to move much faster than expected. So in those kind of instances, you'll notice what I did here on the 27th today is I don't actually take the whole thing down, but I take a good portion of it down. And given the size of the move and the velocity against what I already have existing, this trade broadly served its purpose, which is shorter term in nature compared to the other trades. And it's based again on the flow that I saw leading to the position. So this represented a realized piano of 20,720. Again, this is relative to the 2 sizing on the model portfolio I've been sharing with you, the actual position, a bit different sizing than here. Now the remaining risk that exists is 2,520 bucks. So I've already more than paid for the risk that's on. I've secured a profit. So now what I'm doing is just following the trend. And again, I",

I've secured a profit. So now what I'm doing is just following the trend. And again, I already told you where the profit taking would be done, which is about 5775, for this leg of the trade that was entered here. So that's really what I'm going to monitor from here forward. The main thing I want to attach here for you is using a broader thematic idea, coupling it with using options as some sort of alert. My guess is people started understanding or getting ideas that we might be hearing about the nuclear energy policy with Trump again. It's hard to tell. But seeing that kind of options activity and then just this massive explosion in volume following, it's telling that a lot of times people get pieces of information before it's fully released. And that seems like what might have happened here. So we still have the 10-Lawed out. We'll see how it goes. Like I said, it'll be locked in for a profit no matter what. At this handle, provided that there's no massive gaps down overnight that puts me outside of that. As always, if you have any questions, let me know. Bien Allair. See you later.",
