Yeah, I think it's driving me back Eric. It's always a pleasure. Absolutely. Pleasure. We're sitting there kind of BS in for a little bit about how I essentially just the ultimate failure and it's kind of fun to figure out what other ways I can mess things up. But it's always good to talk to people like you that are figuring it out. You just had a really awesome trip over to Europe. I mean, talk to us about that. What do you think? For me, life, markets, everything's all one puzzle that's all wrapped up. So now having two small boys, like I said, being able to show them the history in person and Italy and Rome. And there's just just a phenomenal get outside, get into mountains, exercise and physical conditioning too. It was just wonderful trip. Great way to also rest the mind and recharge the batteries. Just fantastic. Yeah. Now, what kind of stuff did your boys really enjoy doing? What did they gravitate to? So it's so we started off in the mountains and we did some like mountain biking and just like being a lot outside. So they just love like and that's amazing thing about kids. They just love that freedom. They just like be out there and just explore open pastures. Mountains was great. And",

And so it was funny that there was like the two extremes that part and they enjoyed the beach and pool like period, but they also just like love Rome and the history. And so for me as a history lover, it's great. Like I was saying, show them like, Hey, like you see that balcony there? Like that's then you show them on your phone. That's where Mussolini was, you know, whipping up the crowds and all that like before, like World War II kicked off. And like even at like six years old, they're like amazed. And even for me, it kind of gives me chills to see it all like in the same place. So it's pretty awesome. It's also a good reminder like markets, everything and like things repeat and what to be aware of. So it was awesome. Well, and one of the cool things that you were telling me right before we started talking is that how your what one of your sons was like really starting to like pick up the gravity of things. And like I just feel like that's got to be so cool to be able to experience them experiencing that",

Yeah, like just for them to see how like the world, you know, they still see things very black and white, but to see them start to like connect the dots of how everything and how the world functions and you know, they grow up in a nice environment and then to see like, Oh, there could be bad actors out there and the repercussions and all that. So it's amazing to see it kind of almost relearn it through someone else's eyes again. It's it's a great experience. So cool. So cool. Dude, I love that. So one of the things I like to ask traders specifically that do stuff like that though is how do you set your portfolio when you go on vacation mode? Because funny enough, I was telling you, I was just in Alaska. And I had to go through a similar process that I always find interesting to try to describe to people, but as you know, I love learning your approach to stuff.

So it's like you kind of been trouble. But you know, like I learned even on my honeymoon, I ended up spending way more money on losses than I did on my honeymoon because I became an attentive and positions won against me. So I I never fully disconnect because I I find even being completely away for three weeks, you lose that touch and that feel. So I always have a couple of things definitely watch every day, but just really reduce size. And I just I make sure that I can at least check market open. So I can put in stop orders if need be. And then I can go on my own. But you know, having like 30 exposure is not the same as having 120 exposure. So at least if you're you have light positioning and use at least you're watching you get the best of both worlds. You get to have like a a mind that's not overly kind of way down by markets.

There's a book called Blink and it's very much about subconscious processing and priming. So when you talk about that idea of like this touch and like the feel of the markets, it's funny because when you talk to people that don't really understand it, it's like very esoteric, it kind of just sounds whimsical like nothing. But then when you're actually like a practitioner of it, you get like I literally know exactly what you're talking about because I actually think it's a bigger part of what a lot of traders do, especially more discretionary traders that are not, you know, just algorithmic in nature. So when you're taking a step back in your analyzing what you're doing, you're kind of seeing like this process that I'm following, value-ad versus value-not-ad, do you have any examples of something that when you're looking at it, you realize that this is not actually tremendous value-ad? Yeah, you know, it's sometimes it's the merging of, you're trying to merge like processes in your mind. So it's like there's",

So it's like there's certain tools and or applications that work well with how it's day trading. And so the impulse will still come out. Like you can see that in the short term, I can say it goes as a short term opportunity. But then after when you're positioning or what like it throws off a larger strategy, let's say you're not right about that move, then it affects your average cost. And so like sometimes, you know, even though it looks like a good setup in the short term, trying to like through impulse kind of merge two different approaches kind of work against you. But you know, but everything like you kind of touch on, it came more to the forefront for me. I was at one point, I got really deep into like kind of redalue when everything he did and like what he calls like kind of the golden system about how he manages risks with diversification, like which is very different from how I approach things.

It was like the most unexpected answer I could have expected, you know, but I think as you go on with time as a trader, especially when you go through periods of drawdown, like when you're fresh, you're new, it's like let's go, let's go, let's go. And but then when you kind of get go through like the meat grinder a little bit, like you realize how like keeping your mind centered and focus is so that's almost the difference between those who end up succeeding and those are just drop off eventually. Yeah, it will and it's funny when you, you know, chuckle about the responsive meditation because one of the things that I find with practitioners that get good at pretty much anything they're doing over the long run, they essentially just boil things down into like these really seemingly simple things, but there are things that are done really well.

Like, what does that mean? What do I do with that? And it's really eye opening though. And I think it's important for people to hear those kinds of messages because it goes back to what I, what Leonardo da Vinci, I think he said, um, simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication. And I love that line because I notice people that get really good at trading or other things. They're really good at breaking things down into their core concepts, simple and doing them really well, really, really well. So that's an interesting one to hear from your perspective though, because I like the way that you're kind of talking about like balancing those two parts, those two systems in the mind. Um, when you're on your vacation, it sounds like you're like me where I still absolutely look at markets.

Like those three days specifically, were really interesting to me personally, but I'm curious if they were anything special to you, or just what you made of that move there. So this year, it's a really interesting year because when we spoke about our own past podcasts together, like I always fall like to fall like the net highs, like number of stocks making 52 week highs versus 52 week lows. And that hasn't been very accurate this year. It's been very wonky because what we're going through, like, bouts of inflation messes up the normal mechanics of markets. Like that's why like you saw like in the past couple of years, like, you know, the like the 60,",

So so inflation breaks the regular like functioning of the market. The market still function, but the regular relationships go in opposite directions. And so I think coming off the bottom, we're starting to kind of get that rebound once inflation peaked even though the Fed had and cut rates and all that yet. But we entered in this thing like basically like a cable recovery, like they're saying, there's a few stocks are doing really great, but then there's a lot of stocks are not doing well, like not doing great at all, which not that every cycle everyone's doing fantastic, but like the disparity between the few and the many has been larger than any kind of normal cycle in recent in the recent past. So that's been exacerbated with AI and how large caps have led. And again, if you go back historically, if you look at like each year, who's like like the the biggest two or three stocks at the SP 500, those don't tend to be the market leaders that year because they're so big, they're so kind of cumbersome.

So a lot of what you were talking about in terms of just price behavior totally made sense. Now what are your thoughts on the rationale behind the seemingly I wouldn't call it inversely correlated personally but maybe not correlated or something but definitely a not normal correlation that I feel very confident saying I just don't know what the numbers are off the top of my head. But when you're looking at large and small, what do you make of the relationship there and how it got so defiant? So I think again because of the K-shape recovery, it just made sense that I think funds started to move to the safety of large companies who had pricing power and all the rest and then I think AI just kind of fell into their lap. They were already kind of a long large cap and like shying away from small cap for that reason.

So even like with clients who are saying like, oh, you know, now that we have these net highs, do we have this big bull market starting now because like small caps took off. And so my concern, and this is like where the gut instinct will still kind of come in because you have this indicator. And just knowing that there's some weird kind of issues going on because of this disparity. But what I think happened was that just like what the yen carry trade that blew up, it was the crowd of trade. Everyone was large, long large cap tech, short small caps. And then we just went the other way really quickly as things started to reverse. So I think it was just more of a big short squeeze like an basically a long squeeze on the long push people out both directions. And that's why you just got so incredibly negatively correlated because I think that was just funds way off base way overly concentrated being blown out in both directions. And so that's why I think now you can see that that relationship has kind of fallen back into a little bit more normal and normalcy than what it was for a little while there. Got it. Okay.

And I always thought it was a little bit of just a overly reactive market, like very emphatic is what it seemed like to me. Like just people, it's funny.

But the way down typically quicker, but did you make anything special about that three day period, essentially, where it just undid that entire move? I think it was just easy come easy goes.

Yeah, so we bottomed, VIX hit was 65, so it was clearly that, at least in the short term, it was extreme. Either we were going to rebound or we were going to crash. So I mean, I think the bank of Japan backed off, which was the crisis of that moment. So I think we started our rebound today. I think it was a little bit more of surprising that we are so strong today. I think it's because PPI was low and they're expecting low CPIs or result tomorrow.

It's really hard to tell if if the market isn't like still embarking on a deeper correction because of a weakening economy, which I think it is, I think the economy is weakening in the feds behind the curve.

For sure, some phone calls went off and the people in the know were told KOK, bankage of pans in a back off, they're not going to keep raising rates. Don't worry about it. We're not going to crash. We'll support more. So someone got the phone calls. I think that Monday morning to alleviate panic. So you saw that even I bought, I was lucky. I had no positions going into it. I had just one but it's like utility. It was untouched. And so I mean, I did a little bit of buying that morning. But once you get that initial burst off of the bottom, it's like, OK, where do we go from here? So I kind of eased out a little bit out of things. And now it's waiting to see how we consolidate. It just so happens that we end up going back a little more parabolic.

It could be like, you know, other cycles, oil was the hot trade or whatever. It just so happens that the stocks that are the hot trade now are like the biggest market cap stocks in the market.

Honestly, one that I hadn't thought too much about the I mean, if you look back to the early 90s, like when the internet was becoming a thing like IBM wasn't like the hot stock of the market, you know what I mean? Or like if you go back to like, you know, early 2000s, like it wasn't, you know, I don't know, Exxon mobile that was the hot stock of the market going up and down like crazy.

So then I moved on to something else, but I set a bunch of alerts because I was just like, I just know that this, I just know this is",

And I use that trade as the vector just because it's a recent one that was kind of entertaining. So I get to talk about how dumb I was at the beginning of it.

Yeah, I'm still pretty pissed off though because in the beginning, I was just looking left looking right and I was just like, what's happening? What's small? Do something. Well, if you think that makes you upset, I had a position SMCI last year. That's one of the best for so last year at let me look my chart here. So from like June, it was a 200. I had like, I had built a big portfolio. Like I think I was like a 40, 50 position in SMCI portfolio from like 200 up to 340. And then earnings were sour or kind of gaped down. So I got out of it with like, you know, some profit, but less profit. And like I'm watching and there was so many failed attempts. And all the sudden like January, it's like lagging, really keep you up at the market. And all of a sudden from 300, you're 1200 is like the trade of the year. I'm like, use anyways, I was like again, being a little bit early sometimes. And that's just and how to have that same position would have been like, wow, like epic year",

And it has a as a slick way of doing it too, because you do the way you did something different, but we both lost how? I don't know how anyone who's traded long enough can be egotistical. I don't know. To me, it's impossible. It's like if you have an ego after trading for like five, 10 years plus, wow, there's something special about every single person I know has traded for a living is a very like centered person like, okay, that's that's what the market gave me and like just move on, you know, like it just it'll grind you into into the ground",

So like, you know, I've been trading professionally since 2008. I started trading 2003, 2004. Like I've seen these cycles so many times. And sometimes you get them so like I've had like some really epic runs in three, four months. Like, you know, multi hundred percent return. And then other time it's like, your lag for 12 months, it's 18 months where you just like, you're making a big play. You just, you just can't get it to connect. So like when you go to that cycle multiple times, you just realize like, okay, it's one of those cycles and you just have to learn to be centered and not like blame yourself or not go off and change everything and just stay centered and stay focused because like it's just this recurring cycle of being sometimes super right.

But to your point, sometimes the market is just going to throw something else. And I'm actually curious how you think about solving that dichotomy because you can't put your hands up and just be like, oh, the market is just doing whatever the market does and not hold yourself accountable. But you also can't punish yourself into the dirt because if you do that, the market to your point will continue to humble you. Do you have any thoughts about like how to reconcile those two things as a trader? So it's funny. You speak of Jim Ropel. So I you know, I talk with Jim sometimes and he's a super nice guy. And there's something I kind of stole from him. He calls him guard rails. You know, like things that you just want to make sure you don't make like a serious mistake.

Like were there any like like more serious mistakes? And so I kind of like trying line up different rules to be those guard rails to not make them again, you know? So like for example, like looking back at the past like, you know, year and a half, I always focus on small mid gaps. That's always just where all the actions always been. So it's like I saw Nvidia.

So, but no, like the bingo cards. Yeah, exactly. You know? But again, like so it's like you have the rules of like relative strength.

You almost don't even know to know need to know earnings and sales. If the market's going to drop 10 and you're like at least a mid cap or higher. So you're not just like a small cap story. If you won't fall when the market's falling 10 or 15, somebody does not want to sell you or somebody wants to buy every single share they can get. So to me, it's like again, for this past cycle, looking at it, you know, I always put a lot of weight on the net highs and at lows, but I think that the most important factor for me above all, no matter how each cycle as I study things, that relative strength, like and that comes through in the corrections.

Like even now we had this correction, everyone's going to go back and look at let's say micron or SMCI that were hot last cycle. But those are not the ones that held up well in this cycle the same way. There's new names, there's new things going on. So again, like why chase micron that's fallen 30, 40 when something like Palantir is already back at 52 week highs and barely budge during like the market sell off. So it's like every cycle again, you get that opportunity and have those guard rails so you don't make that same kind of mistake you made on a prior cycle. Eventually, as long as you manage risk, you're going to kill it then one of the cycles and do great. Yeah, that's awesome. I love that. What a great way to look at it.

And I mean, if you have, let's say, a fed cutting cycle coming in or even let's say a productivity boom, but then if you have someone who puts up more regulation or has more like really poor fiscal spending, at least to inflation that prevents the rate cut.

Because like you're talking about, because I agree with you like to me, it seems like the outcome of the election, whichever way it goes, it will mean something for markets. So for me, I, well, I mostly trade shorter term anyways, to be honest, like let's just keep it up a buck here. It's like if it's a three week trade, that's an eternity. That is like",

It's like if it's a three week trade, that's an eternity. That is like I am geriatric at that point. I am, yeah, I mean, just what I don't even know to do with all that time. So the vast majority of my stuff is two weeks maybe. So for me, the general game plan I'm using is just kind of honestly like trading the general book leading into, but I am actually avoiding more thematic positions that I typically would put on like one of my favorite things that traders is general positive drift in the market. Super simple trade, not much goes into it, size it down, use options, just say, lovey and come back to it in six months. Now I don't have that on. And part of it is because the recent market activity, but also because I have some reservations about how this could go. So in your opinion, how do you set yourself up leading into the election, understanding that it can have a pretty big impact. It's hard. It's one of those things like, you know, month to month, week to week is all this macro, week, economic data. So you have to kind of like separate your views and even like some stuff we're talking about",

Like I don't always catch every uptrend perfect, but I've never been caught in a big downtrend. Thankfully, you know, knock on wood, you know, so again, I was uh, cashed up for this drop. So, and I was not that I was killing it before. So at least I, you know, I didn't kill it on the way up, I didn't get killed on the way down. But again, now is that great time where you can see who didn't fall in this market draw. And so I'm watching stocks.

Then after we're looking at some other, like the large caps, like meta as held in great, I think meta is someone where like data has become all the more valuable with AI and all the rest. So I think they're just going to find more and more tailwinds like monetize all of that and reach out to new people. So again, they held them very well. There's just a lot of great names that did not break down with this market environment. And a lot of them are midcaps. You know, there's things like Kava, which is the restaurant, a Mediterranean restaurant group. There's just so many I can name like a service now is more large cap held in well.
