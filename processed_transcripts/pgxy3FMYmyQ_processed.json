    "text": "Ah, poor one out for the homies in Theta Gang. Today the market had a pretty good rally and a bunch of them likely got ran over like you're seeing here. This identifies one of the drawbacks of selling calls among quite a few others. Now that doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with it in terms of holistic strategy, you can still do things like the wheel, the coverage triangle, but one of the fatal flaws of a place like Theta Gang is their myopic. They will only sell premium and like anything that becomes binary, you tend to miss a lot of opportunities. And that isn't always the best practice especially as a trader. Now if you're less active, trying to be more hands off, that's cool. You got to pick something that's going to be some trade-offs. But if you're doing this professionally, you leave way too many opportunities on the table by only trading one side of the coin like this. So shout out to Theta Gang. Hope you guys get through all right. I'm sure you will. Being all iron. See you all later.",
