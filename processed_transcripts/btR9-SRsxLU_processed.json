I want to talk about CRWD crowd strike and what's going on there as I'm still learning a little bit more about the technicalities behind it. So I thought we could do that together. And then I want to talk a little bit about how things like GameStop are looking for the week out ahead. So we have a few things that we're going to touch. First off, we can start with kind of a broad market overview of what events we have coming up this week, which you can see up here. We'll filter this out to be this coming week. And there are a few things that I think are worth directing your attention towards. The very first one is starting on the 23rd and it looks like really Monday is kind of super quiet. There are a couple earnings coming out. I think there's a Verizon stuff like that. So there's not a ton that I'm seeing there of significant interest. The 23rd is mostly home sales. So a couple of those will be larger impact, but not massively impactful either. The 24th is when we start getting some more inflation level data. This is really important. So things like the PMI from SP, we will absolutely want to keep an eye on those when",

So things like the PMI from SP, we will absolutely want to keep an eye on those when those are coming out. The market will probably be fairly sensitive to them as well. Then we have Fed Bowman speaking on the 25th PCE QOQ coming out GDP QOQ. Those are going to be massive really, really, really informative figures along with jobless claims. So as I look at this kind of boring Monday, Tuesday, then the 24th starts to pick up. The 25th has some important information. And then the 26th does as well with PCE month of Vermont personal income spending, the balance sheet core PCE. So yeah, this tail end of this coming week has a little more economic activity going on. And a lot of this stuff is still just very, very topical to the market. And it boils down to where we think rates are going. A quick look at the Fed watch tool. It shows us still with a 95 probability now of no change in 31 July. And then 18 September, it's a 97 probability of an ease, which this is even kind of interesting because the no change probability was pretty high. Then it dumped down is low as 1.92.

Then it dumped down is low as 1.92. And now it's back up to 2.86. Still insignificant. Still very, very low probability. And right now it looks like a 25 basis point cut as compared to the 50 basis point, which would be down here. So if we take a look at the just aggregate probabilities, you can kind of see what the market is looking at. Obviously here is where we are now. It's looking at essentially a 25 bips cut in the September meeting. Then another 25 bips cut in November. And then another 25 bips cut in December. My guess is after this first one goes through, we probably would see a pretty, I think a pretty significant change in these probabilities would happen there. Based on what I'm seeing from the Fed, I would find it hard to believe that they would just immediately go through this cutting campaign, although I think it makes sense. But if they've been so data oriented, I should say. And that includes leads and lags. That's kind of why I paused when I was saying that. Because sometimes it looks like they're being indecisive or slow to respond. And I think that that's part of it. But they continue wanting to see data. So that's why I lean, especially",

So that's why I lean, especially if they're doing these smaller cuts, like 25 basis points, sure you could do two of them back to back. But then I have to imagine you probably would take a pause depending on what data is coming in. It's really difficult running the leads and lags of these kinds of economic systems. I'm not going to pretend that I have any idea what they're looking at or how they're looking at it. But really for the market, this boils down to the market wants cuts. So if this starts changing where the market is not seeing the probability of a cut remaining is high, you'll probably see that flow through to the market. That's essentially the way that I look at it. All right. So that's kind of the main stuff coming up this week. Let's take a quick look at DJT because this is the easier one to start with. So we have our folks over here at Austin Private, relatively unknown, realistically before this. They do have some good Google reviews though, good for them.

And you can see that there was a really interesting trade that came through at some point. So essentially right before this assassination attempt underwent, there was a massive, massive trade that came through. People thought that was interesting timing. And there's a little bit more to it than that. It doesn't boil down at least as far as I can see to that. So what happened here? Pretty simple. We saw this trade come through and this was the filing date. That is important to differentiate from when the trade went on. There are leads and leads and lags to when trades are placed versus when they are filed. So in this case, the position was on since 30 June. And this is when they chose to file. And this fell in line with when they tend to file their stuff historically. The other thing that we noticed here is that there was a pretty interesting unilateral issue with their data. And you can see that they use a third party vendor and they applied essentially a 10,000 contract multiplier for everything, not just DGT, all their stuff. So this does look like a fantastically strangely timed clerical error. And this does happen. This is one of the issues when we have a little too much coincidence and we start going",

This is one of the issues when we have a little too much coincidence and we start going down the rabbit hole too fast, too deep because it is also not overwhelmingly insignificant that this fund is tied to BlackRock, which had some sort of relationship with the shooter that's now dead, thankfully. And that I think is interesting. But BlackRock owns pretty much everything. So it's not like that crazy. The other thing I want to point out to people is that if we take a look at DGT, the idea of putting on like a bearish position in here is it's not crazy. It's been going down since the end of March. It's literally had lower highs, successively and persistently. The lower lows is starting to chill out right here as compared to here. So you could argue that it's starting to gain a little bit of a footing. But this isn't something that you look at it and you're like, again, from a trading perspective, I don't look at this and be like, ah, bullish. This is going up.

That is my goal is to put information in front of you and then maybe help interpolate it as best as I can, but leave it up to you all to arrive at what you think happened or did not happen. Now the other thing that we do have to talk about though is this whole crowd strike business. And it is not insignificant. And you can see that it is massively impacting the stock. It has been falling off a cliff. Essentially from the 16th of July, we closed here at 369 giga and we hit a low of two like sub to 90 over the next three days. That is a massive down move.

And this whole thing has a really, really big impact. So I thought I would play a little bit of this video that I've been watching because this dude knows way more about this stuff than I do and we can learn a little bit together. So let's get after it. It's by businesses. This has caused impact. I could never have imagined everything from business meetings falling apart to news networks being in a pretty funny state to the absolute chaos with flights. So what he's highlighting here is the broad based impact, which is really important to note by the way, for interconnected systems like this, when you have that level of impact, it is really difficult to isolate and fix things. So essentially there was this giant blue screen of death that started track just hitting essentially everything like this right here. So what's been going on with it? Let's see what else he has to say. I think he gets a little bit more into it here. Estigating breaches. So when a company gets hacked, they're the company you would call in to figure out why they were hacked, what happened and what the impact is. So if you were affected by something like ransomware attacks, this is the company that would come in",

So if you were affected by something like ransomware attacks, this is the company that would come in and help clean up the damage. Because of that, they started creating a lot of software, think like Norton or malware bytes, but way deeper and their goal is to make sure anything that even looks like it might be one of the pack like that. A lot of companies require you to use this software. It's not like, oh, you can choose one. So what he's talking about is how pervasive it is and essentially how many companies are experiencing outages from it. We know that this is really widespread. It's across industries. We saw the airports getting hammered because of this right here. I saw a lot, a lot of news about it. So we know that the overall issue is significant.

First Jim, let me, let me start with, I want to personally apologize to every organization, every group and every person who's been impacted by this. A little bit more sure file that drives some intent. And what that means is there's a single file that drives some additional logic on how we look for bad actors. And this logic was pushed out and caused an issue only in the Microsoft environment, specific to this bug that we had. So that's an important note, right? As we talk about the overall impact and even from this other video when he was walking through the impact on the plane tracking that they saw this, it's clear that it's not fully impactful, right? Because if that's what it looked like before the strike or the issue, I'll leave it as now. That's what it looked like before. And then that's what it ended up looking afterwards. I can't get the time perfectly. So we're going around before this issue occurred and that there's after. There's still planes up there, right? Like it's still tracking something. So",

So that tells us that obviously not everything is routed onto that. We identified this very quickly and rolled back this particular content file. Obviously many organizations are impacted, rebooted and we've fixed the issue. So the systems are coming up and running. The good old turn it off, turn it back on. I mean, I think that is about as classic as you could possibly get with having an issue. And it's really good to see that even the CEO of companies like CrowdStrike lean on the same thing that I do. That's great. Systems may not fully recover and we're working individually with each and every customer to make sure that we can get them up and running and operational. But to be clear, it was not a cyber attack. It wasn't anything related to that. It was a content bug or update that we sent out that we identified and we rolled back. So I think that's important to hear and that's the reason why I wanted to walk you all through this because it's something that I saw a lot of people talking about.

Now, this is a really interesting event from a trading perspective because we, for me, I like to see the dust settle to make sure that we're not necessarily in any sort of giant problems, but I do really like to play reversion plays on stuff like this. So the way that would look is I would be setting stops something again like this. So it creates a really tight range for us to move. And if we start getting a break back up this way, I like that to the upside, at least to get back into generally where it was before. These news driven kinds of events provide really interesting pricing opportunities and far as far as market extremes. So anyways, that's something I'm looking at here. Now let's talk about GameStop quickly because we just ran through an expiration cycle and we had our live stream yesterday with my boy Newton. That was super fun.

And there's a couple really interesting things that we're seeing going on primarily in that we did see a decent move, right? So from the first of July up here, it's about a 20 move. And now it is falling back off. We're getting near a couple key levels as far as moving average and stuff like that. I don't care so much about that in something like GameStop necessarily to be completely honest with you. It's primarily because as I always say, I think it is different, really different price driving factors. So volume has been very light. This is looking at a one month volume scheme. And you can see that we're still declining pretty massively from what we were seeing even back in here, right? On the late, it's kind of like mid to late June. We saw almost double the volume that we're seeing now to a degree. So I'm keeping a really close eye on volume expansion.

First off is we have shed a lot of options. So across all series, all strikes, we have 571,000 calls and 350,000 puts. This is much, much lighter than what it tends to be. And my expectation is that I think we're coming into a quieter period. That's what seems to be happening here. A couple of things do stick out the volatility again for the front expiration. Just it tends to tick up week off. This is almost, it's pretty rock steady at this point. You can almost expect to see it. It's actually something I've been trading because I continue to see it. Now the other thing that I look at is where we see the next centralization of volatility, which is out in 16 August. So a couple of other things as I look at it are where do we see the majority of this volume? And you'll notice that the majority of what we have now is kind of split all over the place. We see that there's stuff out in 16 August that becomes the next main expiration cycle. So that doesn't surprise me. And then we see some of these pockets. And these are the 26 July's.

There are some decent sized positions here in 26 July, although it is much slower to be abundantly clear than most of what else we've seen. But like this right here is not insignificant. The 30s expiring five days from now currently have 21,400 July with 16,000 volume from Friday. So this is people that are just sliding out a week. They're not going out super far, which again, you all know how I feel about that by now. But it's what's happening. And if we take a look at the further out strikes because these are the weeklies in not the monthly, you'll notice if you go to the monthly, you'll take you out to 125 on the weeklies, they keep you into the 95s. That's just for liquidity. As I continue to remind you guys, a lot of this is you're going to see less liquidity in these weeklies, more liquidity in the monthlies. And you'll see that expressed in the number of contracts that are there, the number of volume per day. You'll see that in the number of strikes offered. It's a function of liquidity. So anyways, all the way out here at the 95s, there's 14,000 contracts with another 5,600 traded on Friday. And it looks like they're still building.",

    "text": "contracts that are there, the number of volume per day. You'll see that in the number of strikes offered. It's a function of liquidity. So anyways, all the way out here at the 95s, there's 14,000 contracts with another 5,600 traded on Friday. And it looks like they're still building. So there's more people moving out into these super far out of the monies as well. Smaller positions. The last I looked, nothing that looks heavily sizable. And the last thing, well, let me summarize this at least. So right now it looks like in terms of an overall participation standpoint, the options chain is slowing down a bit. We're seeing a slight expansion in near term, vol with the next real look coming out at 16 August. And the other thing I'm noticing is the disparity between calls and puts is much lower. There's used to be two times two and a half times, three times more calls than puts. And now it's almost even this is the closest I've seen it across all expiration cycles in a while. The next primary expiration cycle is starting to get built out. Although there are a couple larger lingering positions in the 26 July's at the 30's and then at the 95's. So the last thing I want to show you guys is back over here. And I want to take a look at not crowd strength. I want to take a look at GME. And I specifically just want to",

I want to take a look at GME. And I specifically just want to look at the volume for the previous week. And the reason why I think that that's helpful is to see how people are positioning in the near term. So this you'll see that there are some still really large positions. Most of these large positions are still on notice that these are still set 19 DTE 26, 26, 544. These ones have come off 89 26. So a lot of these larger premium overall positions still exist. So that matters to me because we didn't go through a massive exodus of open positions that are backed by a pretty significant values. They're still open and out there. So I'm going to keep an eye on this. I'm still is always looking for options activities and keeping an eye on everything else because there's a lot going on right now. Biden just dropped out. Kamala looks like she's got the nod from him. So that'll be interesting the way the market reacts to that. So far it doesn't look like much. The market's actually up with futures right now. I see that you minis up 0.3. So Russell's trailing a little bit tiny little bit 0.28. And then the NASDAQs recovering",

So Russell's trailing a little bit tiny little bit 0.28. And then the NASDAQs recovering pretty well at 0.5 up so far. Now these overnight opens. They don't necessarily translate highly informatively to the next day, but it's not the inverse. Where if you see these down really big the night before a lot of times, you'll see them not looking great the next morning. So there's not much to read into this in terms of what this does to price tomorrow. But it does mean that standard behavior is really what I'm seeing here. A little bit of a recovery at least because the market writ large last week went through a little bit of a game. Definitely. We saw pretty uniform sell-offs across pretty much everything. So there were a couple sectors showing strength, but seldom. And we'll see if the market is going to start moving into a consolidation period now. Or if it's got a little bit more of a correction coming ahead of it. That's what I'm looking at right now. I didn't as that saw a pretty massive move. The Russell is still showing relative strength. And the SPX is kind of somewhere in the middle. So that's where we're at now. As always, any questions, anything you want",
