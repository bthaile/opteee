OBS sometimes tries to trick me into thinking that I'm not be able to look at this stuff but cannot hold me down cannot hold game stop down. I'm actually really excited for today's session and it's because the last shit like two months we've been going through all of roaring kiddie's old trades which has been really fun we learned a lot and on the last video we actually went through and kind of summarized all of that which again I'm like really really stoked on that. However the thing I'm most excited about now is the opportunity for us to start opening up or scope a little bit more and I want to start diving deep into the primary game stop theories due diligence research and I literally want to apply similar methodology to what we've just done with roaring kiddie's old trades and I want to go through them in depth I want to understand how different people are thinking about the movement in game stop as a whole and then most importantly I'm focusing on the predictive capability of things because as I continue to remind everybody there's two very distinct sides of my brains when it comes to this whole thing.

The first thing is I think a lot about game stop as just in absolutely fascinating study of markets literally love that and then the second part though is a way to make money. I was actually texting with Newton earlier today about some of the stuff that I've been working on and I was like just reflecting a little bit on how much time I've spent analyzing game stop and we're on like for the live stream series we're on a few months in. So the goal for today is we'll do a recap on game stop first I want to talk about what happened last week what that looks like for game stop going forward and then I want to actually go through super stonk and then I also want to go through GME those two reddits so that I can look I'm literally going to sort it by top posts and I'm going to see what I can find I'm sure a lot of it will be like just memes and jokes and stuff of course but I want to find the due diligence and I want to specifically go through in depth the due diligence and see what we can learn",

From this past May but I started going back further and further and what I started to identify were a massive string of different perceived signals and I've been regressing them and literally that's just statistics speak it sounds fancier than it is but it's just analyzing relationships that's essentially what a regression analysis is. And it helps me understand from a quantitative perspective the predictive capability of things the reason why it's so important is because the human brain is so primed to remember things that validate what we want to see. And we forget things that invalidate what we don't want to see and that is a really insufficient way to analyze really anything right that's why most people I find fascinating from a political standpoint where people think that like the other side of whatever side your honor like dumb and stuff like that and it's like people have different preferences right and the example of one political person saying well the other side is",

It's literally them being so wrapped up in their own bias that they can't even understand somebody else's perspective taking that into trading and I use the political sphere for that because it's so common to see that and I think just about everybody has seen that. Meanwhile, I will do my best to understand what my bias and preferences are compartmentalize those and then still conduct objective analysis that's what I do is I look at things as objectively as humanly possible to analyze and it is because I recognize my own fallibility is a human being I understand deeply my own biases even in cognitive processing and I don't trust myself that's what it comes down to. But that mistrust leads to like really, really, really effective analysis. Alright, so first things first I need to grab our map and I need to see if we have any people from our hard to reach places.

And then alright, so let's get pot stem. Add a little pot stem. Where's that at in Germany? Oh, so it's just like Southwest of Berlin. Interesting. Let's uh, well, you already know I I'm an interest like I'm just interested in everything I find myself being a generally curious person. So with this being close to Berlin. I just want to see what it looks like around your hood. So let's just do a quick little peak here. Let's go for a quick stroll through pot stem. This looks like a good spot. Hey, look at that.

I have to be honest. Let's go over here. Very gray. I want to go across this bridge. A lot of bikes. Can I not go across this bridge? What's the what's the issue here? Do the Germans not allow that?

Chris says better to go in late summer, beautiful coast, bay. And it may be rainy and windy. The winter. So you have to be lucky to get good weather. I'd recommend late spring or fall. Okay, got it.

So now look at this. Yo, you guys have some fucking super cool buildings. Love this. Moody Blues says, what are what are nice areas to live in San Diego for a person looking to move from the Midwest? Well, it doesn't really matter where you're moving from. I think it depends more on like what what you like. But best possible piece of advice I could give is the same advice that I'm going to heed myself when we move because we're moving out of here in the not so distant future is just come visit. Like if you like the city and stuff like that, then that's cool. Down south is perfect for that. There's a lot of beautiful places along there. We like stuff that's a little more out out of the way. So we live in a slightly different area that's we live next to a nature preserve. So we're like four miles from the beach not far at all. It takes us less than 10 minutes",

The main thing I like is that it's on the foot hills. But the tricky part is is like I hate this. I hate when it's just like fucking house on top of fucking house. Like that is the bane of my existence. And it's one of the reasons why I start looking for stuff so early is because I would be looking for something that's kind of by itself that has a really nice view hopefully. But has a little bit more room around it. I do not like stacked houses on top of each other. I like a little bit of space because otherwise you're living experience is just so much predicated on who you live around, which kind of sucks.

It's the level of shitty that varies quite a lot like even San Diego during May and June. It's fucking foggy. It's like they literally call it May, Grey, June, gloom. It's like two months. Again, it's not terrible. Right? Like it's fine. But it's like two months that you don't see the sun. And it's because the Marine layer comes in and it just sits there all day.

I think any place that you look to live is just a series of trade-offs and like what you value. One of the reasons why we stayed in San Diego for a while is because I was really big into surfing. I liked surfing a lot. And I've fallen out of favor with surfing. I don't really surf that much anymore just because it started getting way too crowded. And it kind of kills the experience for me. But yeah, if if you're not like super into the ocean, I or the beach maybe I just don't know why somebody would live in San Diego. Reng Titty says the San Diego also have San and it does. We're actually having it right now. This is probably my favorite time of year because it's cooler out like in the evenings it gets to the low fifties. And then the Santa and a wins. They're like these really warm wins. It's just a very cool feeling. It's really, really neat to me. I like it a lot. But we do absolutely get the Santa in us. All right.

Which is again, I can't weigh on that either way because this is close enough where it's realistic. It's very realistic. The other thing though is that I always try to remind people that Max Payne does move. Max Payne is not a static figure. It moves as options move. And you have to think about what's going on here when it comes to Max Payne. So what I mean by that is let's say for example, we figure out, I think there's a website that does Max Payne, right? This one. I'm just looking for. Here we go. So here. So this website shows us for an expiration. This is using the primary expiration of. Oh, no, this is the next expiration. I'm sorry. And it shows the Max Payne here. And Max Payne is at 20. What will happen as the week goes, this will move. It won't stay at 20.

The first reason why you'll see it move is because as options come up on their expiration. People will naturally move out of their options that are further out of the money. And then Max Payne will drift towards at the money because people that are further out of the money tend to close their positions out and move on into something else. So just something to be aware of. And again, I'm not saying there's no, there's, I have a video talking about Max Payne. And there's absolutely evidence that manipulation does occur. The problem now with something like GameStop is it's becoming large enough that manipulating the stock price any significant degree becomes more and more challenging with the more shares that exist, the higher the float that's out there, it just becomes more difficult. That's not to say it can't be done. And again, looking at Friday's close, it is, I mean, that's like less than 20 cents a way. If I'm a market maker, I'm absolutely doing that. So I'm sure those motherfuckers are doing that. But the main thing is like, actually, I'm curious. Let's take a look at like a five minute. I'm just looking at the ebbs and flow of volume.

And then this is interesting that there was a big surge that came in around 11, who's normally you would see this kind of volume over here. But this doesn't surprise me that it ended up getting getting bid down. And the main culprit there is literally just an artifact of it had really strong volume to propel it into this. But then that volume gave up. It didn't stay strong and seller stepped in pretty big time. Again, whoever those sellers are, what their motives may be. That's another story. But this absolutely would not surprise me at all. If it was manipulated below 25, I can 100 see that. So big volume spike to big, big volume spike. We have to talk about that. Because if we take a look at the seventh, the seventh had a five day volume of 5.4, 20 day volume of 5.7. When the 20 day volume and the five day volume get that close to one another, it tells us that we're kind of at like a proverbial floor level of volume that there's just not that much going on.

When the 20 day volume and the five day volume get that close to one another, it tells us that we're kind of at like a proverbial floor level of volume that there's just not that much going on. And then we have literally like three times that amount on the eighth, a massive spike. You can see 305 relative volume on the 20 day. So big, big, big volume stepped in here. And a lot of it was by volume, which is really, really interesting. So if we take a look, we'll grab. Unusual whales. Is there perfect for this. And let's take a look at the order flowing game stop specifically. Friday. Eighth. And I have puts turned off. I'm looking at everything bid, mid ask offer, nothing, just so that I can see what's going on. And then I'm going to sort this by premium. And I mean, there's some big options trades coming in. This is definitely larger than what we've seen recently, but it's still like this isn't roaring kitty sized. As far as I can tell, this just looks like a bit of a step up, but not crazy. This starts getting more interesting, but this is a little further out in time, 20 days, 2000 to the 25s. Then we saw the 15 noves those got hammered. We talked about that already.

We're into the says how we looking for a gamma ramp. Let's take a peek. Not good. Yeah, not good. It's not terrible, but it's not good. The reason why it's not good is because the 25s here are heavy AF. These will help a lot because there was a ton added as well. And we have volume exceeding open interest. So there's going to be net add here, no matter what. And there was already 10,000 added on the day prior. So there's massive build out going on here. The problem that we have is that like this here starts to slow down a little bit, but this is still 10,000 more added on the 26s. Which that's pretty good. So if this hits well enough, that absolutely can start bidding people via hedging behavior on these 25s to go out by the underlying. Definitely that would impact price because that's enough to start doing it. But then we have a pretty giant gap at the",

But if there's enough hedging activity that happens simultaneously here on the 25s, it could skip essentially any real requirement on the 25s. And it can start pressure in the 26s. The problem is after that, it kind of falls off a cliff because then here again, there's net add no doubt, but it's light. There's a net add here as well, which is also light. So that's the problem. The 30s are heavy for sure. They'll have another 10,000 added at least. But the problem like there's just not a lot in here to get there. The prospects for a gamma ramp are really, really specific and most importantly, stock availability. And there's tons of available stock right now. That's like the biggest issue that we're going to have with the prospect of a gamma ramp is that with the stock being so readily available. It is really difficult for a gamma ramp to take massive hold because there's enough liquidity. So in general, that's again, not suggesting that there couldn't be one at all, but I wouldn't expect like based on what I see here. I don't see like a massive run coming that's",

And I think this like 19 and a half level would at least to me be generally the lower the lower floor. And then we have 20 and a half as the bottom of this channel that's has been defined pretty heavily. And then we still have a ways up to the upside. And I think that there's a giant volume note here on a six month daily to me. That's a probably a much bigger reason why the stock didn't rally up and out through 25 is because my guess is that there are armies of people right now that have a really high cost basis that are happy to get out of it here.

That's my guess. We go out to a year. Yeah, like look at this. It makes it makes a ton of sense. So if you go back here, you can see this other volume note on an even longer term timeframe. This volume node literally ends at like 25 and change. It's there. So what that tells me is that there are going to be lots of people over the past year specifically within this timeframe that have probably scaled in really heavily way too much during these giant spikes up. And then we have a terrible basis that they've continued to add money into to cost average themselves down. And a lot of them will be very happy to get out here. And I think that's why we saw last week a pretty even distribution of sellers starting to step in throughout the day. It still was overwhelmingly a by date to be abundantly clear. But there was still 24 of the volume was sales. So there were absolutely people happily unwinding, especially as it started drifting up to that.

And guess when this timeframe was this is when it was at 25 and that timeframe literally matches up with these longer term volume nodes of people that have gotten really just way too oversized. At way too high of a basis. And this is exactly what they're dealing with right now. So that doesn't surprise me. This is going to serve as near term resistance in my opinion that again, as always doesn't mean that it can't overcome near term resistance. It always can. And it's just a matter of time before it does. But it's typically not a just clear shot through unless there's just overwhelming strength behind it, which right now it doesn't look like that that's here. So. Cedric says so you don't think that was to keep those 25s out of the money. It's I can't say it that discreetly. It's it's probably a mix of things. But what I say that the primary price movement here was only to keep the 25s out of the money. I don't believe that.

And the reason why I don't believe that again is because it matches up with these very common broader human tendencies. So for example, let me give you an alternative. Let's say for example, let's use this here, this volume node. So at 1698, let's call it 17 down here at 17. There's a really small volume node, right? So that means that people transacted here. But in terms of overall volume of people that transacted at that level, it's not massive. It's not a ton. When you look at something like this where it's almost as big as the point of control, this is the second largest volume node on the for the past year. So that means over the last 52 weeks again, most of it centralized here in April, May. Tons of people transacted at these really high prices. So the very, very common thing. And again, you can see it happen as it gets near this 25 handle here. It got near the 25 handle here. That's human psychology because there are people that again got into this thing for 30, 40, 50. And then they start buying more and more and more as it's going down to try to reduce their basis. So that then when they are offered a chance to get out with their money, they",

So that's why I think every time you see this thing coming up near 25 people are getting the fuck out because there are tons of people that have lots of money at really high prices that they probably averaged into reducing their basic. But consuming more and more money. That is probably what's going on here. So looking at something like this is really clear that 25 right now has to be broken. And the cool part though about once 25 is broken in terms of support and resistance. It starts to look pretty fucking open right. So if we get through this 25 handle, which is kind of like this whole block here. Above that guys the limit there's there's literally no overhead resistance at that point. You can see that there's a tiny amount of people that got fucked and there's stuck up here that just sucks to suck.

It's such a transacted level on all these different time frames on a three month word. We haven't really been there for very long. So that's where people are starting to step in them to exit.

Let's take a look at the surface. I'm just going to use the primary explorations for now. And wow, that's fucking crazy. Jesus. This is crazy. Lots or lots weird here. Cliff notes really high call IV. Really, really, really jagged put side IV. So unclear pricing on the put side very, very, very unclear for 20 days massive call IV relative, which is very interesting. Look at this. This is crazy.

And it's difficult sometimes to get a fill at the prices that show the the skew, but that's a massive skew. Just really, really interesting. So the to click one level in that's like the overview level. And to go one level in further than that, this entire period of front expiration lower IV strikes compared to 20 days means something. What exactly it means I have no idea, but it means something and it's because normally you won't see this level of a variance between these. This is a big discrepancy. This is again 87 compared to 104. That's a big, big variance. That's an easy trade to make because you can run on the put side. You can buy the 15s and fade the 20s.

These are expensive. Something like this. And if the movement goes as expected, either direction, meaning we see implied volatility rise. If we don't get a price movement and IV rises, our current PNL will still move up. It will still go up. Then if it doesn't, that's when we lose. But the idea here is that it would move.

Let's do. Oh, I. So light. Light options chain. 567. 18. So big call skew. But relatively small sizes. We do see a little bit more of front expiration. And then the next biggest expiration, though, is still way out in 17 Jan. 17 Jan's interesting because I don't think this is people playing 17 Jan as if, oh, I think something's going to happen in 17 Jan.

And then the next biggest expiration, though, is still way out in 17 Jan. 17 Jan's interesting because I don't think this is people playing 17 Jan as if, oh, I think something's going to happen in 17 Jan. I think this is people just putting on longer term positions in GameStop to play the Delta movement leading into that. And what I mean by Delta movement that simply put is if we take a look at these 17 Jan's. And if we go out this far, let's just say that you grab something that's like a good Delta like these 46s, 59 Delta, something I prefer a little bit in the money. If there's good, you know, strong conviction in the overall direction for the ticker, you kind of, you know, get yourself out of really massive theta decay. And even if you're out this far in time, if you get a big move, you'll be able to profit from it. And we can look at an example of that. Let's go back to 25 and I'll literally show you a trade that I put on here. And as I saw this volume, we've talked about this before on the 25th of October, we had a pop in volume that was followed by more volume on the 28th. This is every single time I've seen GameStop move. It is with the same kind of volume behavior. And this is the most predictive thing that I've found after my",

It is with the same kind of volume behavior. And this is the most predictive thing that I've found after my like literally probably 200 hours of research specifically into GameStop. I actually would say that that's probably lowballing it probably about that. And volume is been the most predictive thing that I can eyeball. On the 25th, we had obviously a big day, big volume, but it ended up selling off that then ended up being caught on the 28th. So the 28th, this turned into just a standard breakout play. So once we started getting into the mid 20s, mid 21s, just buy some options. That's all it was. And I still have my longer term standing positions. I actually think like a lot of you, if I'm not mistaken, I think I have a short call. I'm going to have to manage. I don't know where they're at. But I could tell you, so I don't remember. Let's see. Where are these short calls at? They are definitely. They're definitely in the money. That is for sure. And they have six days of expiration. So we're going to have to manage those.

IV would have contracted a little bit so definitely wouldn't help, but that's not the primary thing. Theta you got it. That's exactly correct. So the problem is as we fast forward at time. This thing has been suffering theta decay. And because it's getting closer and closer to expiration, its theta decay is growing exponentially. Each day, this 15 know of 25 call is losing 6.70, whereas the 17 Jan 25 calls is losing 2.84. Significantly less. And this because it didn't have a big enough move fast enough, even though it did have a good move, it still wasn't enough in order for it to break through. And make money. This is the problem with short dated options is that you really need to move and you need to move quick. And this is why I like to use longer dated options.

Because if you look at here, it went from 22 to 25, but if you look at here, it went from 20 to 25, right? So you miss about half the move by catching it last week. Now again, that's not saying top ticking bottom taking it's impossible. But these kinds of days on expanded, volume can't be ignored. That's all. And it's also a really important thing to note that just because volume spikes doesn't mean it goes up. There's a very specific reason why. I didn't get into it on the 25th and it literally did start breaking out, but it didn't go far enough for it to make sense. So all that does is gets added to a watch list for the next day. And then I say, what happens to the volume and does it actually start breaking out of the recent price action? And if so, then obviously I'm very interested. If not, then I am less interested. That's the way that I tend to look at this kind of thing because supply and demand always behaves in specific ways. It's not super",

That's the way that I tend to look at this kind of thing because supply and demand always behaves in specific ways. It's not super predictable, but it does have tendencies that we can generally rely on. A car list as market makers will not let the price move up. They want your money playing call options is a good way to lose your money. That's not true. It's not true at all. Market makers make money by transactions. And they make money through your transactions by capturing the bid ask price. They can make a little bit more money if they're able to suppress price. But if you suppress price, then you have no movement. You have no movement. You have nobody that enters the stock. So it's really important again to try to remain objective. I'm not saying market makers are angels. I'm not saying market makers don't manipulate anything. I'm not saying any of that. But what I'm saying is that market makers do not have full control over the price of anything. It's a bit of a different context to remember. Again, we already talked about it at the beginning of the live stream. The probability of a market maker manipulating the price here to try to drive this down with their buddies is super fucking high. I would not put",

The probability of a market maker manipulating the price here to try to drive this down with their buddies is super fucking high. I would not put it past them at all. But there's also a reality that the market maker didn't stop this from going from 20 to 23. They didn't stop this from going from 22 to 23. They didn't stop this from going from 23 to 25. So the problem is is retail traders, especially retail traders that are not familiar with options. They get pissed off because they're losing money because they're making bad choices and they want to blame something or somebody. And it's just escapism. I just gave you an example. I can literally guarantee you that if this kind of thing happened here. On Reddit or somewhere like this. If that kind of thing happened. The redder. Would far more likely than not.

It's why a big reason most people in the US, when we're forming LLCs and entities like that, we will form them in Delaware, Wyoming, those kinds of places. Delaware is really, really well known for their privacy. But that's still penetrable. It's not impenetrable.

That's interesting because what, there's a recent photo of Ryan Cohen with icon, isn't there? Pretty sure there is. That's an arranged 2.5 mil financing deal. Lenders would be repaid in shares. Okay. Depending on the strike price, that conversion, that's that spiral financing. Thomas, in Andreas, bait in advisors, intermediaries, leveraging an offshore fund, Amro International registered in Panama Beach, or in Panama, based in Zurich. He'll include it as social, questionable entities, yeast, I mean, it believes short setting.

But that's, see, that's the problem with shorter float stuff because short float stuff can be manipulated much more easily, right? So taking something that's essentially a penny stock, right? 5, 6 bucks and taking it down into sub dollar is really not that crazy. So this makes sense. Manipulation accounted for 40 of the trades. Yep. Harm Sedona, loss business, secure new financing, turned SEC. Rowing City says seller boxing. This isn't seller boxing. The reason why this isn't seller boxing, at least from a functional standpoint, is a big part of seller boxing is you actually implement management that's complicit. So this based on what I'm seeing here, the management was not complicit. The management was trying to figure out what the fuck is going on and they're trying to fight back. So a bit different than seller boxing. Huh, who knew?

Yees brokers are required to have reasonable grounds to believe that shares can be borrowed for delivery before allowing short sales. This is meant to prevent naked short selling where a short seller does not actually borrow the shows before selling them lead into provincial FTDs, FTDs, mandates, clearing agencies report them.

This is meant to prevent naked short selling where a short seller does not actually borrow the shows before selling them lead into provincial FTDs, FTDs, mandates, clearing agencies report them. Let's see the loopholes, grandfather clause. One of the most criticized elements was the initial grandfather clause, which exempted existing fields to deliver before implementation for mandatory closing requirements. This allowed large amounts of short positions to remain unresolved. Options market maker exemption. Market makers and options contracts were initially exempt from locate and delivery believe that they needed the flexibility to facilitate trading. This is one of the problems like this. I don't like. I under liquidity is important, but when it is the only guiding force for what we're doing, you lose transparency. It's kind of like the similar phrasing of anybody who I forgot the fucking who the fuck said this shit. It's something like anybody who over values, security over liberty deserves neither. Some shit like that. I think it's Benjamin Franklin at home. I forgot the exact saying, but it's something like that where if you prioritize security so much, and it essentially becomes an infringement on liberty. So that's kind of what I see here. Exemption was exploiting allowing market makers to create synthetic short positions. Same oversight. Yep. Off exchange transactions. Right show. Primarily focused on public exchanges did not cover dark pools and then extended settlement periods. Short sellers could extend the settlement period",

Grandfather clauses gone options market maker exemption gone closeout rule. Two or four introduced to closeout FTDs mandated brokers must close out FTDs. By the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day after failure occurred to Pulse 4. It failure persisted that broke Ruby restricted for making further short sales without first borrowing or ranging to borrow the security. That's actually kind of interesting. Because if you think of this as a forcing function, it's actually not really a forcing fund. Because all it says is that you can't short more. It doesn't, it's not saying you have to close out your existing shorts. Which that's a little bit interesting.

How customers can discern between trusted and compromised media outlets. Okay. Lucy emphasizes verifying claims with documented evidence and maintaining a record of media accuracy over time. Mainstream media such as CNBC may not always be reliable. Communities like Superstung provide valuable data based analysis off and more informative. Yep. Okay. Yeah. Complex options strategies to create phantom shares by inflating the number of shares shorted without actual delivery. That's interesting. Explain number four more. Brokers and hedge funds use complex options strategies to synthetically create shares that do not exist, such as buying shares while simultaneously selling calls or puts. These trades allow participants to create synthetic long that can be lent out as if it were the real stock that's facilitating short shares without the actual underlying shares. Buying right, buy right transactions and resetting obligations, buys the security sells a call on the security allows the trader to use the bought shares to cover a short position while simultaneously creating a new delivery obligation through the call option. That's fucking super smart. Effectively bypassing the standard settlement requirements",

How well understood are these things by people like in the community writ large? Like I'm curious. T.C.M. King says this is why cycles happen sort of. I actually don't fully agree with that. The reason why I don't fully agree with that is because by going through this synthetic process, it essentially means that like this can be done into perpetuity. Right? So it would actually be the antithesis of cycles because by doing this, they get themselves out of T plus two. And by being out of T plus two, they no longer are constricted. They have used this loophole to locate. So the problem is, with these loopholes that literally give them ability to do essentially synthetic locating, it essentially gets rid of the cycle theory because there wouldn't be a cycle because they're not beholden to the time frames. Evene de Griggs says, been aware of this for three years, but I'm curious like to the depth. Like what is the overall depth that people understand this stuff? All Putin says T plus two is no more.

With so many people looking at this, to me, it seems like it would just be really logical that it would move closer and closer to viable information that everybody could then probably make money off of.

So but I can totally understand how people could get bored. TCM says most of the community believes that short interest is much greater than reported. The rest of the whole OS is that short interest is still very, very high. I got it. Okay. So it's still the real emphasis on a squeeze",

Media's role. We know this. They know what occurs in regulated spaces, but like transparency in off exchange. Okay. Consider it adopting a system of unique numerical identifiers for each share known as hard locate to prevent repeated shorting of the same shares. That's cool. That's also interesting that it was rejected. I don't know why. Why would that have been rejected, guys? Any ideas? Manipulation by overstock in 04. I don't hear this reference much.

And he and I we had some really interesting conversations about like religion because you guys know he's like super religious. And what that's one of my favorite things about he and I because when it comes to like belief systems, we are like polar opposites because he's not just religious in like a standard, you know, like kind of religion. Like the type of beliefs that he has with his religion are like very specific and they're a little I don't want to call it extreme. That's dramatic.

And that doesn't convey the correct point, but they're like more I don't want to call it strict, not strict either. I don't know the word to use here, but it's like there's more to it than like standard. Yeah, thank you. Rowing to the perfect. Thank you, rigid. That's the word. Thank you. They're more rigid and the like the belief system is very rigid. And I am very much a libertarian. Like I want everybody to believe and do what they want. And a big part of his belief system is that he thinks everybody should be and believe the setup that he has. But the way that he believes that is so different because it's not like a missionary style like go convince people. Right. It's still let other people be their thing. It's just one of the one of the coolest things ever. Rowing to the says, what does libertarian have to do with religion? I use libertarian not in the context of a political party. But libertarian is a belief system and a big element of a belief system is that like if somebody came to me and they said like Eric, should I be Muslim or should I be Christian?

Because Sadrik says he doesn't give a shit what you think or do. That's and that's the cool part, right? Is that he that's exactly right. He has his own belief system that's very rigid.

I need to learn more about like the fucking mod drama. I've heard of different pieces of it, but I just haven't heard like what the what the beef was. And I'm also really sad that these stopped. I really like these. Alright, so we got to save this page for sure. And we'll add this to our to do list. I guess this is what we're going to be going through for the next hot minute. We have a bunch of DD to run through and then we'll figure the rest out. Alright guys, I'm gonna go stuff my fat face with some chicken parms, some salad and whatnot.
