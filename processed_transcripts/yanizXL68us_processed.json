    "text": "you you you you you you E The first thing is I think a lot about GameStop as just an absolutely fascinating study of markets literally love that. And then the second part though is a way to make money. I was actually texting with Newton earlier today about some of the stuff that I've been working on and I was like just reflecting a little bit on how much time I've spent analyzing GameStop and we're on like for the live stream series. We're on a few months in. So the goal for today is we'll do a recap on GameStop first. I want to talk about what happened last week, what that looks like, what that could look like for GameStop going forward. And then I want to actually go through Superstank and then I also want to go through GME, those two reddits so that I can look, I'm literally going to sort it by top posts. And I'm going to see what I can find. I'm sure a lot of it will be like just memes and jokes and stuff, of course. But I want to find the due diligence. And I want to specifically go through in depth the due diligence and see what we can learn and try to piece things together because I've been studying from my own perspective, the movement in GameStop, not just from when I really started getting more involved in the community from this past May. But I started",

But I started going back further and further. And what I started to identify were a massive string of different perceived signals. And I've been regressing them. And literally that's just statistics speak. It sounds fancier than it is. But it's just analyzing relationships. That's essentially what a regression analysis is. And it helps me understand from a quantitative perspective, the predictive capability of things. The reason why it's so important is because the human brain is so primed to remember things that validate what we want to see. And we forget things that invalidate what we don't want to see. And that is a really insufficient way to analyze really anything. That's why most people I find fascinating from a political standpoint where people think that like the other side of whatever side you're on are like dumb and stuff like that. And it's like people have different preferences, right? And the example of one political person saying, well, the other side is dumb is literally them being so wrapped up in their own bias that they can't even understand somebody else's perspective. Taking that into trading and I use the political sphere for that because it's so common to see that.",

Meanwhile, I will do my best to understand what my bias and preferences are, compartmentalize those and then still conduct objective analysis. That's what I do is I look at things as objectively as humanly possible to analyze. And it's because I recognize my own fallibilities of human being. I understand deeply my own biases, even in cognitive processing. And I don't trust myself. That's what it comes down to. But that mistrust leads to like really, really, really effective analysis. All right. So first things first, I need to grab our map. And I need to see if we have any people from our hard to reach places. So we have our ape map. And where are we from? If there's anybody that hasn't told me previously where you are from, you got to throw it in now. So that then I can catch you on our map.

So with this being close to Berlin, I just want to see what it looks like around your hood. So let's just do a quick little peak here. Let's go for a quick stroll through pot stamp.

Oh, doing a little bit of, hey, look at that. That's pretty. Listen, all I'm saying is that the Germans might have a lot of rules, but their shit always looks on fleek. Their stuff looks cool. Chris says better to go in late summer, beautiful coast, bay, and it may be rainy and windy. The winter. So you have to be lucky to get good weather. I'd recommend late spring or fall. Okay. Got it. Because that's actually really helpful. Because yeah, I mean, rain is never good when you travel in general. Just because, you know, it's more difficult to like walk and see places, but I like, neither of us really like the, like the heat. Roaring City says rabbit hole Eric.

Moody Blues says, what are, what are nice areas to live in San Diego for a person looking to move from the Midwest? Well, it doesn't really matter where you're moving from. I think it depends more on like what, what you like. But best possible piece of advice I could give is the same advice that I'm going to heed myself when we move because we're moving out of here in the not so distant future is just come visit. Like if you like the city and stuff like that, then that's cool. Down south is perfect for that. There's a lot of beautiful places along there. We like stuff that's a little more out out of the way. So we live in a slightly different area that's we live next to a nature preserve. So we're like four miles from the beach, not far at all. It takes us less than 10 minutes to get there. But we're, we don't have like a bunch of houses around us. That's the tricky part in San Diego is in order to avoid being surrounded by houses.

Yes, you like that part I don't, I'm not super stoked on because that's I don't know Dan if you're if you already know, but that's literally exactly where we're looking to move is to around Colorado Springs. We're looking at like the Black Forest area or I'll show you. So the areas that we are looking at. We're looking at the Broadmoor in here. And then we're looking at Black Forest out here, I think. Those are like the main spots that we're looking at. But we have to go stay for a while.

The main thing I like is that it's on the foot hills, but the tricky part is is like I hate this. I hate when it's just like fucking house on top of fucking house. Like that is the bane of my existence. And it's one of the reasons why I start looking for stuff so early is because I would be looking for something that's kind of by itself that has a really nice view hopefully, but has a little bit more room around it. I do not like stacked houses on top of each other. I like a little bit of space because otherwise your living experience is just so much predicated on who you live around, which kind of sucks. Dan says that area is also subject to getting big hail storms, a few years back, all the cars parked at the zoo were total. Whoa, that's crazy. I did not know that. Dan, is that specific to the Broadmoor just because of like the elevation gain? I'm guessing it has a little bit. That's nuts. I did not realize that. That's really, really good to know.

I'd say we just went to Alaska. You know that. And we loved it, but I'm also wise enough. I know Alaska in the summer is a very different vibe than Alaska in the rest of the year. That's the that's the main problem with Alaska is that you have when or I'm not trying to deal with, PBH. All right, so let's move over to the main screen. This one. And then let's take a look at GameStop to start. So GameStop had one of its busier weeks for literally some time now. It's been a minute since we've seen really anything resembling life. And I was elated to see some of this activity. Now I know a lot of people right now are getting a little bit beat up on short calls because a lot of people think short calls are like free money that you get when you're holding long stock.

So Vladimir says most places in the US have shitty weather for six months of the I mean that literally I can't think of any place that doesn't have periods of shitty weather. It's the level of shitty that varies quite a lot like even San Diego during May and June. It's fucking foggy. It's like they literally call it May Gray June gloom. It's like two months. Again, it's not terrible. Right? Like it's fine. But it's like two months that you don't see the sun. And it's because the Marine layer comes in and it just sits there all day. So yeah, everywhere we'll have its quirks for sure. I've not found a perfect place and I don't think it exists. I think any place that you look to live is just a series of trade-offs and like what you value. One of the reasons why we stayed in San Diego for a while is because I was really big into surfing. I liked surfing a lot. And I've fallen out of favor with surfing. I don't really surf that much anymore just because it started getting way too crowded and it kind of kills the experience",

We're actually having it right now. This is probably my favorite time of year because it's cooler out like in the evenings it gets to the low fifties. And then the Santa and a winds they're like these really warm winds. It's just a very cool feeling. It's really, really neat to me. I like it a lot. But we do absolutely get the Santa in us. All right. So let's take a look at the overall move that we got in GameStop. So on the eighth, we landed just shy of 25 where at like 24 87. I know a lot of people were sitting there pointing at Max Payne saying that it was being manipulated down and stuff like that, which is again, I can't weigh on that either way because this is close enough where it's realistic. It's very realistic. The other thing though is that I always try to remind people that Max Payne does",

It's very realistic. The other thing though is that I always try to remind people that Max Payne does move. Max Payne is not a static figure. It moves as options move. And you have to think about what's going on here when it comes to Max Payne. So what I mean by that is let's say for example, we figure out I think there's a website that does Max Payne, right? This one. I'm just looking for here we go. So here. So this website shows us for an expiration. This is using the primary expiration of, oh no, this is the next expiration. I'm sorry. And it shows the Max Payne here. And Max Payne is at 20. What will happen as the week goes, this will move. It won't stay at 20. You can look at this in two days and it will move. The reason why this moves is well, there's a few reasons. The first reason why you'll see it move is because as options come up on their expiration, people will naturally move out of their options that are further out of the money. And then Max Payne will drift towards at the money because people that are further out of the money tend to close their positions out and move on into",

So just something to be aware of. And again, I'm not saying there's no, there's, I have a video talking about Max Payne. And there's absolutely evidence that manipulation does occur. The problem now with something like GameStop is it's becoming large enough that manipulating the stock price, any significant degree becomes more and more challenging with the more shares that exist, the higher the float that's out there, it just becomes more difficult. That's not to say it can't be done. And again, looking at Friday's close, it is, I mean, that's like less than 20 cents a way. If I'm a market maker, I'm absolutely doing that. So I'm sure those motherfuckers are doing that. But the main thing is like, actually, I'm curious, let's take a look at like a five minute. I'm just looking at the ebbs and flow of volume. So standard surge, this is really interesting. And like nine big surge surge. And then this is interesting, that there was a big surge that came in around 11, who's normally you would see this kind of volume over here. But this doesn't surprise me that it ended up getting getting bid down.",

And then this is interesting, that there was a big surge that came in around 11, who's normally you would see this kind of volume over here. But this doesn't surprise me that it ended up getting getting bid down. And the main culprit there is literally just an artifact of it had really strong volume to propel it into this. But then that volume gave up. It didn't stay strong and seller stepped in pretty big time. Again, whoever those sellers are, what their motives may be. That's another story. But this absolutely would not surprise me at all. If it was manipulated below 25, I can 100 see that. So big volume spike too, big, big volume spike. We have to talk about that. Because if we take a look at the seventh, the seventh had a five day volume of 5.4, 20 day volume of 5.7. When the 20 day volume and the five day volume get that close to one another, it tells us that we're kind of at like a proverbial floor level of volume that there's just not that much going on. And then we have literally like three times that amount on the eighth, a massive spike. You can see 305 relative volume on the 20 day. So big, big, big volume stepped in here. And a lot of it was by volume, which is really, really interesting. So if we take a",

And let's take a look at the order flowing game stop specifically on Friday, the eighth. And I have puts turned off. I'm looking at everything bid, mid, ask, offer, nothing, just so that I can see what's going on. And then I'm going to sort this by premium. And I mean, there's some big options trades coming in. This is definitely larger than what we've seen recently, but it's still like this isn't roaring kitty sized as far as I can tell. This just looks like a bit of a step up, but not crazy. This starts getting more interesting. But this is a little further out in time, 20 days, 2000 of the 25s. Then we saw the 15 noves, those got hammered. We talked about that already. So let's take a look at the last two weeks. Yeah. So what I'm doing is I'm eyeballing how much of this activity is like really centered in the recent days, which most of it is.

The reason why it's not good is because the 25s here are heavy AF. These will help a lot because there was a ton added as well. And we have volume exceeding open interest. So there's going to be net ad here, no matter what. And there was already 10,000 added on the day prior. So there's massive build out going on here. The problem that we have is that like this here starts to slow down a little bit, but this is still 10,000 more added on the 26s, which that's pretty good. So if this hits well enough, that absolutely can start bidding people via hedging behavior on these 25s to go out by the underlying. Definitely, that would impact price because that's enough to start doing it. But then we have a pretty giant gap at the 25 and a half. But if there's enough hedging activity that happens simultaneously here on the 25s, it could skip essentially any real requirement on the 25 and a half and it can start pressuring the 26s. The problem is after that, it kind of falls off a cliff",

The problem is after that, it kind of falls off a cliff because then here again, there's net ad no doubt, but it's light. There's a net ad here as well, which is also light. So that's the problem. The 30s are heavy for sure. They'll have another 10,000 added at least. But the problem like there's just not a lot in here to get there. The prospects for a gamma ramp are really, really specific and most importantly, stock availability. And there's tons of available stock right now. That's like the biggest issue that we're going to have with the prospect of a gamma ramp is that with the stock being so readily available, it is really difficult for a gamma ramp to take massive hold because there's enough liquidity. So in general, that's again, not suggesting that there couldn't be one at all, but I wouldn't expect like based on what I see here. I don't see like a massive run coming that's going to be based on gamma. That's not to say that a massive run couldn't come from something else that then is therefore amplified by the options chain.

Let's take a look. I want to I'm going to use this for now just because I can zoom out a little bit more and keep better scale. This has been really interesting and I think worth a conversation because we have absolutely started to build in a floor here. And this line that's been on the chart, we've talked about this a little bit this line here. I've drawn this a while ago and then same thing with this alert down here at 1932. Actually, I wonder if I can see the details. Yeah, I can hold on one second. I'm going to move you guys over to this screen real fast. I just don't know if this is going to show any information like personal information. It doesn't. When does this show? Alerts. Here we go. So I'm just trying to find game stop specifically.

All right, bring you back over here. So 4th of October, this went on. And if we zoom out, essentially what I'm doing is using this recent price action to determine that level. And the reason why I think this level is important is because this is after we had the additional offering. And I think this like 19 and a half level would at least to me be generally the lower the lower floor. And then we have 20 and a half as the bottom of this channel that's as been defined pretty heavily. And then we still have a ways up to the upside. So you can see that there's a giant volume node here on a six month daily. To me, that's probably a much bigger reason why the stock didn't rally up and out through 25 is because my guess is that there are armies of people right now that have a really high cost basis that are happy to get out of it here. That's my guess. We go out to a year. Yeah, like look at this. It makes it makes a ton of sense. So if you go back here, you can see this other volume node on an even longer term time frame.

So what that tells me is that there are going to be lots of people over the past year, specifically within this time frame that have probably scaled in really heavily way too much during these giant spikes up. They probably have a terrible basis that they've continued to add money into to cost average themselves down. And a lot of them will be very happy to get out here. And I think that's why we saw last week a pretty even distribution of sellers starting to step in throughout the day. It still was overwhelmingly a by day to be abundantly clear. But there was still 24 of the volume was sales. So there were absolutely people happily unwinding, especially as it started drifting up to that. Because again, if we take a look here, you can see most of that sale volume didn't come in until here. And guess when this time frame was, this is when it was at 25.

And this is exactly what they're dealing with right now. So that doesn't surprise me. This is going to serve as near-term resistance, in my opinion, that again, as always, doesn't mean that it can't overcome near-term resistance. It always can. And it's just a matter of time before it does. But it's typically not a just clear shot through unless there's just overwhelming strength behind it, which right now, it doesn't look like that that's here. So, Cedric says, so you don't think that was to keep those 25s out of the money. I can't say it that discreetly. It's probably a mix of things. But what I say that the primary price movement here was only to keep the 25s out of the money. I don't believe that. And the reason why I don't believe that again is because it matches up with these very common broader human tendencies. So, for example, let me give you an alternative. Let's say, for example, let's use this here, this volume node. So, at 1698, let's call it 17, down here at 17. There's a really small volume node, right? So that means that people transacted here.

When you look at something like this, where it's almost as big as the point of control, this is the second largest volume node for the past year. So that means over the last 52 weeks, again, most of it centralized here in April, May, tons of people transacted at these really high prices. So the very, very common thing. And again, you can see it happen as it gets near this 25 handle here, as it got near the 25 handle here. That's human psychology because there are people that, again, got into this thing for 30, 40, 50. And then they start buying more and more and more as it's going down to try to reduce their basis so that then when they are offered a chance to get out with their money, they do.

Well, guess what? It's less informative. It's less informative because it can represent all different kinds of people that got in at all different kinds of prices for all different kinds of reasons. It still can tell us some things, meaning that people have been at that level for some time, and they might be eager to get out. Or it could be larger positioning for larger durations. You don't really know. The beautiful part about the context of the volume profile here is I know for a fact because of the chart that the all of the all of the buying activity at 25 or above literally happened between here and here. So what that tells me is that looking out over this time frame, lots of people got in at lots of really high prices.

So looking at something like this, it is really clear that 25 right now has to be broken. And the cool part though, about once 25 is broken in terms of support and resistance, it starts to look pretty fucking open, right? So if we get through this 25 handle, which is kind of like this whole block here, above that, guys, the limit, there's literally no overhead resistance at that point. You can see that there's a tiny amount of people that got fucked and there's stuck up here. That just sucks to suck. A lot of those people probably would have transacted at additional points to lower their basis. My guess is the majority of this bulk here is this. So once that's moved through, then it's much easier movement. Even on a six month time frame, that's the same level. Again, it's it competes with the point of control.

Cliff notes really high call IV, really, really, really jagged put side IV. So unclear pricing on the put side. Very, very, very unclear. For 20 days, massive call IV relative, which is very interesting. Look at this. This is crazy. So these 23s and 15 know were so cheap compared to the 20 Ds. What did I say the 23s?

And then if you're interested, tell me, and I'll go more into detail, but I don't want to start getting into more technical shit that nobody cares about. Okay, few things. First thing, 20 Ds. Notice how the 20 Ds expiration implied volatility is 94.59 percent much lower than the front expiration at 135.71. This is fairly common. You'll see this. Now, what's really weird here is in the specific strikes, we have a series of puts, all of these puts. So the 23s down to the 21s, they're very cheap in terms of IV relative to what you see here. The 23s here are 103 104 percent IV compared to 80. Yet, the overall chain here is much lower than the overall chain here. So that's a really distinct variance between those individual strikes for a bunch of different reasons. The fact of the matter is, is if you tried to buy and sell them to play it, a lot of times you won't get a fill because I play relative value movement in GameStop all the time. And it's difficult sometimes to get a fill at the prices that show the the",

So the to click one level in, that's like the overview level. And to go one level in further than that, this entire period of front expiration, lower IV strikes compared to 20 D's means something. What exactly it means, I have no idea, but it means something. And it's because, normally, you won't see this level of a variance between these. This is a big discrepancy. This is, again, 87 compared to 104. That's a big, big variance. That's an easy trade to make because you can run on the put side, you can buy the 15s and fade the 20s. You're just playing IV something on something like that. And it's a really good looking trade to me. The liquidity is okay. So the way that this would look would be these are cheap. Those are the 23s. These are expensive. Something like this. And if the movement goes as expected, either direction, meaning we see implied volatility rise, if we don't get a price movement and IV rises, our current PL will still move up. It will still go up. Then if it doesn't, that's when we",

That's a massive skew there. Let's take a look at a couple other things really fast. Let's do OI. So light, light options chain, 567 against 218. So big calls skew. But relatively small sizes. We do see a little bit more of front expiration. And then the next biggest expiration, though, is still way out in 17 Jan. 17 Jan's interesting because I don't think this is people playing 17 Jan as if, oh, I think something's going to happen in 17 Jan. I think this is people just putting on longer term positions in GameStop to play the Delta movement leading into that. And what I mean by Delta movement, that simply put is if we take a look at these 17 Jan's. And if we go out this far, let's just say that you grab something that's like a good Delta, like these 46's, 59 Delta, something I prefer a little bit in the money.

And even if you're out this far in time, if you get a big move, you'll be able to profit from it. And we can look at an example of that. Let's go back to 25. And I'll literally show you a trade that I put on here. As soon as I saw this volume, we've talked about this before. On the 25th of October, we had a pop in volume that was followed by more volume on the 28th. This is every single time I've seen GameStop move. It is with this same kind of volume behavior. That is the most predictive thing that I've found after my, like literally, probably 200 hours of research specifically into GameStop. I actually would say that that's probably low-balling it. Probably about that. And volume is been the most predictive thing that I can eyeball. And so on the 25th, we had obviously a big day, big volume, but it ended up selling off, that then ended up being caught on the 28th. So the 28th, this turned into just a standard breakout play.

And I still have my longer term standing positions. I actually think like a lot of you, if I'm not mistaken, I think I have a short call series that I'm going to have to manage. I don't know where they're at. But I could tell you, so I don't remember. Let's see. Where are these short calls at? They are definitely, they're definitely in the money. That is for sure. And they have six days of expiration. So we're going to have to manage those. I have the 23s that just straight up got ran over. But I have 17, April 25s. I have 30s out there. And then I also have some nearer stuff that I'll show you. So we can use this literally as an example here. So if you go to the 28th of October, over 28th, we need to be a little bit earlier in the day because towards the end of the day is when it was rallying up and out. And here it is.

It makes it easier to see, hey, it's our boy Newton news text on us. What's Newton got? Well, we're talking about hopping on a call. I need to pick his brain on some stuff. All right. So from here, if we take a look at an example, we go to the 17 jans. And we have this big run that we see going on. And we think it's likely to grab some legs. We can come either to the 23s. I ended up going to the 25s. And it was literally just for liquidity. There was more room here for me. These are all old trades from other examples. So I'll just do a one lot for the example. And it's down at the bottom there. So what I want to show you is how this will move compared to something like this. And I'm doing one lots. I'm purposely doing one lots.

And then we can see where these land. Notice the difference. So price moved in our favor without without a doubt. Price moved in our favor. Yet on the 25 calls here, you literally lost money so far. You are directionally correct entirely. You are completely correct in terms of your directional disposition. In terms of your PNL, you are fucked. You are right but wrong. Why did this happen? What happened to the poor soldier at 15 know? Why would he be in such poor shape compared to the soldier that's at 17 Jan 25 same strike? Rointit he says IV less so IV in this instance. IV would have contracted a little bit so definitely wouldn't help but that's not the primary thing. You got it. That's exactly correct. So the problem is as we fast forward at time, this thing has been suffering theta decay. And because it's getting closer and closer to expiration, its theta decay is growing exponentially. Each day, this 15 know of 25 call is losing 6.70. Whereas the 17 Jan 25 calls is losing 2.84 significantly less. And this because it didn't have a big enough",

And this because it didn't have a big enough move fast enough, even though it did have a good move, it still wasn't enough in order for it to break through and make money. This is the problem with short dated options is that you really need a move and you need to move quick. And this is why I like to use longer dated options. So this is exactly why I didn't go to 15 know of and it's exactly why I was out in 17 Jan and it's why I'm out in 17 April is I'm playing longer term ideas. And it gives the trade a much better risk reward profile by being a little further on time. So that's what happened in there. So anyways, going back to where this sits now, the move from this last week, again, it didn't even start last week. And that's one of the funny things I see where people were talking about the movement that was happening last week. And it's like, sure, there absolutely was movement last week.

Because if you look at here, it went from 22 to 25, but if you look at here, it went from 20 to 25. Right. So you miss about half the move by catching it last week. Now again, that's not saying top-ticking, bottom-ticking, it's impossible. But these kinds of days on expanded volume can't be ignored. That's all. And it's also a really important thing to note that just because volume spikes doesn't mean it goes up. There's a very specific reason why I didn't get into it on the 25th. And it literally did start breaking out, but it didn't go far enough for it to make sense. So all that does is get added to a watch list for the next day. And then I say, what happens to the volume? And does it actually start breaking out of the recent price action? And if so, then obviously I'm very interested. If not, then I am less interested. That's the way that I tend to",

It's not super predictable, but it does have tendencies that we can generally rely on. A carless says market makers will not let the price move up. They want your money. Playing call options is a good way to lose your money. That's not true. It's not true at all. Market makers make money by transactions. And they make money through your transactions by capturing the bid-ask price. They can make a little bit more money if they're able to suppress price. But if you suppress price, then you have no movement. You have no movement. You have nobody that enters the stock. So it's really important, again, to try to remain objective. I'm not saying market makers are angels. I'm not saying market makers don't manipulate anything. I'm not saying any of that.

After we went through all of his trades from this, the overwhelming majority of his money didn't happen during these periods that we're talking about FTDs and cycles and stuff like that. If we look at the change in the portfolio value, the first massive jump is here and here. So in 2020, we had a 400 gain and then a 600 gain. And then in, what is this, 2020 and April, we had a 570 gain. Then if we take a look at down here in 21 during the squeeze, there was a massive gain on 27 Jan and then on 13 Jan. And then when he came back in 24, he was up 511 from where he left. And at this point, he went from 34 mil to 210. Everything that we identified from his movement so far.

Because again, we've already talked about this. If we like, you don't even have to look that far to see that if there was like this really supreme timing strategy, you don't have your portfolio cut in half or cut down by 31 or cut down by 38 or cut down by 22 or by 25.

The overwhelming majority of what we see here reflects that exact thing that it's building massive positions, having absolute zen-like ability to hold through incredible draw downs. And again, I think the reason why he's able to do this is because this is money, a small amount of money that was put into a yolo account into something that he could clearly see opportunity that he was significantly convicted and and ride the motherfucker out. And each time it started moving, he placed bigger and bigger bets and guess what he did? He didn't place bets with stock. The vast majority of his bets came through options and it's for the leverage. He used leveraged growth. That's exactly what you see here. Leveraged growth at work, which is, I don't know, I think that's really cool. Really, really need to see. But that is a very specific approach to making hundreds of millions of dollars that is wild. The portfolio volatility is fucking crazy. Literally is absolutely crazy. Very cool. But it's crazy. Like here, he went from 48 million here and he was down to 17 million here. Like to be able to just, eh, fuck it, hold through that, that's crazy. And that's exactly what he did. And then when he disappeared, he had 34. He came back with 210. Then he went from 210 to 590 down to 268. Literally doubled his money and then undoubled his money. That's essentially what happened",

It's why a big reason most people in the US, when we're forming LLCs and entities like that, we will form them in Delaware, Wyoming, those kinds of places.

We'll take this whole thing. I'm going to throw it into chat GBT. I'm going to tell it to summarize this. I don't want to miss March her work, but it's just a lot of fucking words. Okay. So let's see what she's talking about here. Sedona, Pennsylvania software company, soft funding, engaged, investment banker, Michael, whatever the fuck owned by. I'm a group of from a group owned by icon. That's interesting because what there's a recent photo of Ryan Cohen with icon, isn't there? Pretty sure there is a vassette arranged 2.5 mil financing deal. Lenders would be repaid in shares. Okay. Depending on the strike price that conversion, desk, desk spiral financing.

Despite this, bait and orchestrated aggressive short selling through brokers at refco fucking bastards causing Sedona stock to plummet from six to 10 cents within a month. But that's see, that's the problem with shorter float stuff because short float stuff can be manipulated much more easily, right? So, that's essentially a penny stock right five six bucks and taking it down into sub dollar is really not that crazy. So this makes sense manipulation accounted for 40 of the trades. Yep, harm Sedona lost business secure new financing turned SEC. Rohingya said seller boxing, this isn't seller boxing. The reason why this isn't seller boxing, at least from a functional standpoint is a big part of seller boxing is you actually implement management that's complicit. This based on what I'm seeing here, the management was not complicit. The management was trying to figure out what the fuck is going on and they're trying to fight back.

Exposed challenges and fully enforcing rex show especially in the case of highly shorted stocks and under conditions of extreme market volatility demonstrated that certain participants could still find ways to engage in or benefit from manipulative short selling. And calls for increased transparency which we haven't got. Yo I can't even get my next question out because of all these suggestions are literally perfect list SEC reforms after rex show. Grandfather clauses gone options market maker exemption gone close out rule to for introduced to close out. FTD's mandated brokers must close out FTD's.

This proposal reflects a broader commitment to improving the integrity transparency of trading environment, including including short selling practices. Okay. Requires certain market participants to disclose more detailed information about short short sales public reports on aggregate short positions and that's interesting. Enhanced focused on FTD's. And the first scrutiny on FTD in the use of dark pools text you short sales that's cool. The focus was ensuring that rules surrounding settlement transparency is we're being adhered to like that.

Lucy emphasizes verifying claims with documented evidence and maintaining a record of media accuracy over time mainstream media such as CNBC may not always be reliable. We use like superstar provide valuable data based analysis often more informative. Yep. Okay. Complex options. And then we have to start to create phantom shares by inflating the number of shares shorted without actual delivery. That's interesting. Explain number four more. And hedge funds use complex options strategies to synthetically create shares that do not exist. Such as buying shares while simultaneously selling calls or puts these trades allow participants to create synthetic long. That can be lent out as if it were the real stock that's facilitating short shares without the actual underlying shares. Buying right by right transactions and resetting obligations. Buying the security sells a call on the security allows the trader to use the bot shares to cover a short position while simultaneously creating a new delivery obligation through the call option.

How well understood are these things by people like in the community writ large. Like I'm curious. T.C.M. King says this is why cycles happen sort of I actually don't fully agree with that. The reason why I don't fully agree with that is because by going through this synthetic process, it essentially means they're like this can be done into perpetuity. Right. So it would actually be the antithesis of cycles because by doing this, they get themselves out of T plus two. And by being out of T plus two, they no longer are constricted right they they have used this loophole to locate. So the problem is if you with these loopholes that literally give them ability to do essentially synthetic locating. It essentially gets rid of the cycle theory because there wouldn't be a cycle because they're not beholden to the time frames.

Whereas somebody that's from a more strict faith. They would say something like you should be blank, whatever blank is because they obviously genuinely believe that that person should be whatever blank is. But his his broader approach to it is really interesting, right. Because Sadrik says he doesn't give a shit what you think or do that's and that's the cool part, right. Is that he that's exactly right. He has his own belief system that's very rigid. But he's still so open, which is really cool because he and I spend a little while talking about beliefs. And it was just a really fun conversation. We both really enjoyed it. Take coming up. Celebrate the fulfillment. Reno Nevada classic Reno 911 memes. Cool. That was that one. Wait, did I skip a row? I didn't. Close up. I love all the fucking GM E Apollo program. The break in the. I love all the 69 Lego memes that Lauren says he puts out positive vibes. I appreciate that massively positive vibes. The other thing I love about him is that like whenever we talk, we it's like an exchange of ideas and it's not like all these like superficial things. It's like actually more cerebral thoughts, which is fucking awesome. You don't",

That's not to say like people aren't cerebral people definitely are. There's a lot of people that are super smart. But to find people that are like truly self reflective is completely different. Real intentions unclear. I thought he was just kidding, but he was being serious. Oh, this is perfect. Be excellent to each other. We're literally just talking about that. No. Both of these should be okay. Both of these should be okay. Damn. I just got straight up out of here. This magazine got me nuts. Golden Jordan wholeburg. Look at this cat. Only you can prevent naked shirts. I like a butterfly hold like a B. He hasn't changed. You've been holding for this long. So what's a little longer at the latest drama with the moderators of. Oh, interesting. Of superstunks should not affect any ape strategy or shake. It's like a lot of dissimilarity and confidence in the incredible turnaround underway game stop.

So this is like really. So the drama from the mods like clearly went live. That surprises me. Content in this explosive DD is nearly as amazing story behind it. Okay. So it's just kind of like a preamble. I need to learn more about like the fucking mod drama. I've heard of different pieces of it, but I just haven't heard. What the what the beef was. And I'm also really sad that these stopped. Really like these. Alright, so we got to save this page for sure. And we'll add this to our to do list. Because I guess this is what we're going to be going through for the next hot minute. We have a bunch of DD to run through. And then we'll figure the rest out. Alright guys, I'm going to go stuff my fat face with some chicken parms, some salad and whatnot. Be an ape outlier or an outlier ape, whatever suits you best. Shout out to the 100 people that are here hanging out. Don't forget to like the video because it does help the channel grow. I much appreciate it. And I will see you guys around. Take",
