I was actually texting with Newton earlier today about some of the stuff that I've been working on and I was like just reflecting a little bit on how much time I've spent analyzing GameStop. And we're on like for the live stream series. We're on a few months in. So the goal for today is we'll do a recap on GameStop first. I want to talk about what happened last week, what that looks like, what that could look like for GameStop going forward. And then I want to actually go through Superstunk and then I also want to go through GME those two reddits so that I can look, I'm literally going to sort it by top posts. And I'm going to see what I can find. I'm sure a lot of it will be like just memes and jokes and stuff, of course. But I want to find the due diligence and I want to specifically go through in depth the due diligence and see what we can learn and try to piece things together. Because I've been studying from my own perspective the movement in GameStop, not just from when I really started getting more involved in the community from this past May, but I started going back further and further. And what I started to",

Because I've been studying from my own perspective the movement in GameStop, not just from when I really started getting more involved in the community from this past May, but I started going back further and further. And what I started to identify were a massive string of different perceived signals. And I've been regressing them. And literally that's just statistics speak. It sounds fancier than it is. But it's just analyzing relationships. That's essentially what a regression analysis is. And it helps me understand from a quantitative perspective and predictive capability of things. The reason why that's so important is because the human brain is so primed to remember things that validate what we want to see. And we forget things that invalidate what we don't want to see. And that is a really insufficient way to analyze really anything, right? That's why most people I find fascinating from a political standpoint where people think that like the other side of whatever side you're on are like dumb and stuff like that. And it's like people have different preferences, right? And the example of one political person saying, well, the other side is dumb, is literally them being so wrapped up in their own bias that they can't even understand somebody else's perspective. Taking that into trading and I use the political sphere for that because it's so common to see that. And I think just about everybody has seen that.",

Meanwhile, I will do my best to understand what my bias and preferences are, compartmentalize those and then still conduct objective analysis. That's what I do is I look at things as objectively as humanly possible to analyze. And because I recognize my own fallibilities of human being, I understand deeply my own biases, even in cognitive processing and I don't trust myself. That's what it comes down to. But that mistrust leads to like really, really, really effective analysis. All right, so first things first, I need to grab our map and I need to see if we have any people from our hard to reach places. So we have our ape map and where are we from? If there's anybody that hasn't told me previously where you are from, you gotta throw it in now so that then I can catch you on our map. We finally, we have somebody from Greenland, which is, I think that's pretty cool. I think that's a fair accomplishment in and of itself. But we still are missing Africa.

Let's, well, you already know, I'm interested, like I'm just interested in everything. I find myself being a generally curious person. So with this being close to Berlin, I just wanna see what it looks like around your hood. So let's just do a quick little peak here. Let's go for a quick stroll through potstem.

Listen, all I'm saying is that the Germans might have a lot of rules, but their shit always looks on fleek. Their stuff looks cool. Chris says better to go in late summer, beautiful coast, bay. And it may be rainy and windy the winter. So you have to be lucky to get good weather. I'd recommend late spring or fall. Okay, got it. Because that's actually really helpful. Because yeah, I mean, rain is never good when you travel in general. Just because, you know, it's more difficult to like walk in sea places. But I like, neither of us really like the, like the heat.

Moody Blues says, what are, what are nice areas to live in San Diego for a person looking to move from the Midwest? Well, it doesn't really matter where you're moving from. I think it depends more on like what, what you like. But best possible piece of advice I could give is the same advice that I'm going to heed myself when we move. Because we're moving out of here in the not so distant future. Is just come visit. Like if you like the city and stuff like that, then that's cool. Down south is perfect for that. There's a lot of beautiful places along there. We like stuff that's a little more out out of the way. So we live in a slightly different area that's, we live next to a nature preserve. So we're like four miles from the beach, not far at all. It takes us less than 10 minutes to get there. But we're, we don't have like a bunch of houses around us. That's the tricky part in San Diego is in order to avoid being surrounded by houses. You either have to go too far inland",

Dan says I'm in Colorado Springs for 10 years now. Cities growing almost too fast, going to be bigger than Denver. Yes, he like that part I don't, I'm not super stoked on because that's, I don't know Dan, if you're, if you already know, but that's literally exactly where we're looking to move is to around Colorado Springs. We're looking at like the Black Forest area or I'll show you. So the areas that we are looking at. We're looking at the Broadmoor in here. And then we're looking at a Black Forest out here, I think. Those are like the main spots that we're looking at. But we have to go stay for a while.

Like the Broadmoor looks cool. The main thing I like is that it's on the foot hills, but the tricky part is is like, I hate this. I hate when it's just like fucking house on top of fucking house. Like that is the bane of my existence. And it's one of the reasons why I start looking for stuff so early. Is because I would be looking for something that's kind of by itself that has a really nice view, hopefully. But has a little bit more room around it. I do not like stacked houses on top of each other. I like a little bit of space. Because otherwise your living experience is just so much predicated on who you live around, which kind of sucks. The answer is that area is also subject to getting big hail storms. Few years back, all the cars parked at the zoo were total. Whoa, that's crazy. I did not know that. Dan, is that specific to the Broadmoor? Just because of like the elevation gain? I'm guessing it has a little bit. That's nuts. I did not realize that. That's really, really good to know.

So the cold air comes off the mountains and it hits the plains. Got it. That's crazy. The channel says Alaska is roomy. I'd say we just went to Alaska. You know that. And we loved it. But I'm also wise enough. I know Alaska in the summer is a very different vibe than Alaska in the rest of the year. That's the, that's the main problem with Alaska. Is that you know what I mean? That's the main problem with Alaska is that you have. When or I'm not trying to deal with. TVH. All right. So. Let's move over to the main screen. This one. And then. Let's take a look at GameStop to start. So GameStop had one of its busier weeks for literally some time now. It's been a minute since we've seen really anything resembling life.

Vladimir says most places in the US have shitty weather for six months of the, I mean, that literally I can't think of any place. That doesn't have periods of shitty weather. It's the level of shitty that varies quite a lot like even San Diego during May and June. It's fucking foggy. It's like they literally call it May Gray June gloom. It's like two months. Again, it's not terrible. Right? Like it's fine. But it's like two months that you don't see the sun. And it's because the Marine layer comes in and it just sits there all day. So yeah, everywhere we'll have its quirks for sure. I've not found a perfect place and I don't think it exists. I think any place that you look to live is just a series of trade-offs and like what you value. One of the reasons why we stayed in San Diego for a while is because I was really big into surfing. I liked surfing a lot. And I've fallen out of favor with surfing. I don't really surf that much anymore just",

But yeah, if if you're not like super into the ocean, I or the beach maybe I just don't know why somebody would live in San Diego. Reng Titty says the San Diego also have San and it does. We're actually having it right now. This is probably my favorite time of year because it's cooler out like in the evenings it gets to the low 50s. And then the Santa and a wins. They're like these really warm wins. It's just a very cool feeling. It's really, really neat to me. I like it a lot. But we do absolutely get the Santa in us. All right. So let's take a look at the overall move that we got in GameStop. So on the eighth, we landed just shy of 25 where at like 24 87. I know a lot of people were sitting there pointing at Max Payne, you know, saying that it was being manipulated down and stuff like that, which is again, I can't weigh on that either way because this is close enough where it's realistic.

It's very realistic. The other thing though is that I always try to remind people that Max Payne does move. Max Payne is not a static figure. It moves as options move. And you have to think about what's going on here when it comes to Max Payne. So what I mean by that is let's say for example, we figure out, I think there's a website that does Max Payne, right? This one. I'm just looking for. Here we go. So here. So this website shows us for an expiration. This is using the primary expiration of, oh no, this is the next expiration. I'm sorry. And it shows the Max Payne here. And Max Payne is at 20. It will happen as the week goes, this will move. It won't stay at 20. You can look at this in two days and it will move the reason why this moves is, well, there's a few reasons. The first reason why you'll see it move is because as options come up on their expiration. People will naturally move out of their options that are further out of the money. And then Max Payne will drift towards at the money because people that",

So just something to be aware of. And again, I'm not saying there's no, there's, I have a video talking about Max Payne. And there's absolutely evidence that manipulation does occur. The problem now with something like GameStop is it's becoming large enough that manipulating the stock price, any significant degree becomes more and more challenging with the more shares that exist, the higher the float that's out there, it just becomes more difficult. That's not to say it can't be done. And again, looking at Friday's close, it is, I mean, that's like less than 20 cents a way. If I'm a market maker, I'm absolutely doing that. So I'm sure those motherfuckers are doing that. But the main thing is, like, actually, I'm curious. Let's take a look at like a five minute. I'm just looking at the ebbs and flow of volume. So standard surge. This is really interesting. I like nine big surge surge. And then this is interesting, but there was a big surge that came in around 11, who's normally you would see this kind of",

And then this is interesting, but there was a big surge that came in around 11, who's normally you would see this kind of volume over here. But this doesn't surprise me that it ended up getting, getting bid down. And the main culprit there is literally just an artifact of it had really strong volume to propel it into this. But then that volume gave up. It didn't stay strong and sellers stepped in pretty big time. Again, whoever those sellers are, what their motives may be. That's another story. But this absolutely would not surprise me at all. If it was manipulated below 25, I can 100 see that. So big volume spike too. Big, big volume spike. We have to talk about that. Because if we take a look at the seventh, the seventh had a five day volume of 5.4, 20 day volume of 5.7. When the 20 day volume and the five day volume get that close to one another, it tells us that we're kind of at like a proverbial floor level of volume that there's just not that much going on. And then we have literally like three times that amount on the eighth, a massive spike. You can see 305 relative volume on the 20 day. So big, big, big volume stepped in here. And a",

We're into this says how we're looking for a gamma ramp. Let's take a peek. Not good. Yeah, not good. It's not terrible, but it's not good. The reason why it's not good is because the 25s here are heavy AF. These will help a lot because there was a ton added as well. And we have volume exceeding open interest. So there's going to be net add here, no matter what. And there was already 10,000 added on the day prior. So there's massive build out going on here. The problem that we have is that like this here starts to slow down a little bit, but this is still 10,000 more added on the 26s, which that's pretty good. So if this hits well enough, that absolutely can start bidding people via hedging behavior on these 25s to go out by the underlying definitely that would impact price, because that's enough to start doing it. But then we have a pretty giant gap at the 25 and a half. If there is enough hedging activity that happens simultaneously here on the 25s, it could skip essentially any real requirement on the 25 and a half and it",

If there is enough hedging activity that happens simultaneously here on the 25s, it could skip essentially any real requirement on the 25 and a half and it can start pressuring the 26s. The problem is after that, it kind of falls off a cliff because then here again, there's net add no doubt, but it's light. There's a net add here as well, which is also light. So that's the problem. The 30s are heavy for sure. They'll have another 10,000 added at least, but the problem like there's just not a lot in here to get there. The prospects for a gamma ramp are really, really specific and most importantly, stock availability and there's tons of available stock right now. That's like the biggest issue that we're going to have with the prospect of a gamma ramp is that with the stock being so readily available, it is really difficult for a gamma ramp to take massive hold because there's enough liquidity. So in general, that's again, not suggesting that there couldn't be one at all, but I wouldn't expect like based on what I see here, I don't see like a massive run coming that's going to be based on gamma. That's not to say that a massive run couldn't come from something else that then is therefore amplified by the options chain, but it",

I would consider this more of like a contributing factor at this point. Let's take a look. I want to I'm going to use this for now just because I can zoom out a little bit more and keep better scale. This has been really interesting and I think worth a conversation because we have absolutely started to build in a floor here and this line that's been on the chart, we've talked about this a little bit this line here. I've drawn this a while ago and then same thing with this alert down here at 1932 actually I wonder if I can see the details. Yeah, I can hold on one second.

Essentially what I'm doing is using this recent price action to determine that level. And the reason why I think this level is important is because this is after we had the additional offering. And I think this like 19 and a half level would at least to me be generally the lower the lower floor. And then we have 20 and a half as the bottom of this channel that's has been defined pretty heavily. And then we still have a ways up to the upside. So you can see that there's a giant volume node here on a six month daily to me. That's a probably a much bigger reason why the stock didn't rally up and out through 25 is because my guess is that there are armies of people right now that have a really high cost basis that are happy to get out of it here. That's my guess. We go out to a year. Yeah, like look at this. It makes it makes a ton of sense. So if you go back",

So what that tells me is that there are going to be lots of people over the past year specifically within this timeframe that have probably scaled in really heavily. Way too much during these giant spikes up. They probably have a terrible basis that they've continued to add money into to cost average themselves down. And a lot of them will be very happy to get out here. And I think that's why we saw last week a pretty even distribution of sellers starting to step in throughout the day. It still was overwhelmingly a by day to be abundantly clear. But there was still 24 of the volume was sales. So there were absolutely people happily unwinding, especially as it started drifting up to that. Because again, if we take a look here, you can see most of that sale volume didn't come in until here. And guess when this timeframe was this is when it was at 25. And that timeframe literally matches up with these longer term volume nodes of",

And this is exactly what they're dealing with right now. So that doesn't surprise me. This is going to serve as near term resistance in my opinion that again, as always, doesn't mean that it can't overcome near term resistance. And it's always can. And it's just a matter of time before it does. But it's typically not a just clear shot through unless there's just overwhelming strength behind it, which right now it doesn't look like that that's here. So. Cedric says so you don't think that was to keep those 25s out of the money. It's I can't say it that discreetly. It's it's probably a mix of things. But what I say that the primary price movement here was only to keep the 25s out of the money. I don't believe that. And the reason why I don't believe that again is because it matches up with these very common broader human tendencies. So for example, let me give you an alternative.

But in terms of overall volume of people that transacted at that level, it's not massive. It's not a ton. When you look at something like this where it's almost as big as the point of control, this is the second largest volume node for the past year. So that means over the last 52 weeks again, most of it centralized here in April, May. Tons of people transacted at these really high prices. So the very, very common thing. And again, you can see it happen as it gets near this 25 handle here. As it got near the 25 handle here, that's human psychology because there are people that again got into this thing for 30, 40, 50. And then they start buying more and more and more as it's going down to try to reduce their basis. So that then when they are offered a chance to get out with their money, they do.

And let's say that this volume node right here again at the 25 handle, let's say that this was built over the last entire year. Well, guess what? It's less informative. It's less informative because it can represent all different kinds of people that got in at all different kinds of prices for all different kinds of reasons. It still can tell us some things, meaning that people have been at that level for some time. And they might be eager to get out or it could be larger positioning for larger durations. You don't really know the beautiful part about the context of the volume profile here is I know for a fact because of the chart.

So looking at something like this is really clear that 25 right now has to be broken. And the cool part though about once 25 is broken in terms of support and resistance. It starts to look pretty fucking open right. So if we get through this 25 handle, which is kind of like this whole block here. Above that sky's the limit. There's there's literally no overhead resistance at that point. You can see that there's a tiny amount of people that got fucked and there's stuck up here. That just sucks to suck.

And then if you're interested, tell me and I'll go more into detail. But I don't want to start getting into more technical shit that nobody cares about. Okay, few things. First thing, 20 days notice how the 20 days expiration implied volatility is 94.59. Much lower than the front expiration at 135.71. This is fairly common. You'll see this. Now what's really weird here is in the specific strikes, we have a series of puts, all of these puts. So the 23s down to the 21s, they're very cheap in terms of IV relative to what you see here. The 23s here are 103 104 IV compared to 80. Yet the overall chain here is much lower than the overall chain here. So that's a really distinct variance between those individual strikes for a bunch of different reasons.

The fact of the matter is if you try to buy and sell them to play it, a lot of times you won't get a fill because I play relative value movement in GameStop all the time. And it's difficult sometimes to get a fill at the prices that show the the skew, but that's a massive skew. So the, to click one level in that's like the overview level. And to go one level in further than that, this entire period of front expiration, lower IV strikes compared to 20. These strikes compared to 20. D's mean something. What exactly it means, I have no idea, but it means something. And it's because normally you won't see this level of a variance between these. This is a big discrepancy. This is again 87 compared to 104. That's a big, big variance. That's an easy trade to make because you can run on the put side. You can buy the 15s and fade the 20s. You're just playing IV something on something like that. And it's a really good looking trade to me. The liquidity is OK. So the way that this would look would be these are cheap. Those are the 23s. These are expensive. Something like this. And if the movement goes as expected, either direction, meaning we see implied volatility rise. If we don't get a price movement and IV rises, our current PNL will",

Then if it doesn't, that's when we lose. But the idea here is that it would move. That's what I would guess is that just looks that looks to be the case to me. Which is really interesting that that's a massive skew there. Let's take a look at a couple other things really fast. Let's do. Let's do. So light. Light options chain. 567 against 218. So big call skew. But relatively small sizes. We do see a little bit more of front expiration. And then the next biggest expiration, though, is still way out in 17 Jan. 17 Jan's interesting because I don't think this is people playing 17 Jan as if, oh, I think something's going to happen in 17 Jan. I think this is people just putting on longer term positions in GameStop to play the delta movement leading into that. And what I mean by delta movement that simply put is if we take a look at these 17 Jan's. And if we go out this far, let's just say that you grab something that's like a good delta like these 46s. 59 delta something I prefer a little bit in the",

You kind of, you know, get yourself out of really massive theta decay. And even if you're out this far in time, if you get a big move, you'll be able to profit from it. And we can look at an example of that. Let's go back to 25 and I'll literally show you a trade that I put on here. As soon as I saw this volume, we've talked about this before. On the 25th of October, we had a pop in volume that was followed by more volume on the 28th. This is every single time I've seen GameStop move. It is with the same kind of volume behavior. That is the most predictive thing that I've found after my like literally probably 200 hours of research specifically into GameStop. I actually would say that that's probably lowballing it. Probably about that. And volume is been the most predictive thing that I can eyeball. And so on the 25th, we had obviously a big day, big volume, but it ended up selling off that then ended up being caught on the 28th. So",

So once we started getting into the mid 20s, mid 21s, just buy some options. That's all it was. And I still have my longer term standing positions. I actually think like a lot of you. If I'm not mistaken, I think I have a short call series that I'm going to have to manage. I don't know where they're at. But I could tell you, so I don't remember. Let's see. Where are these short calls at? They are definitely. They're definitely in the money. That is for sure. And they have six days to expiration. So we're going to have to manage those. I have the 23s that just straight up got ran over. But I have 17 April 25s. I have 30s out there. And then I also have some nearer stuff that I'll show you.

I need to pick his brain on some stuff. All right. So from here. If we take a look at an example. We go to the 17 Jans. We have this big run that we see going on.

So price moved in our favor. Without without a doubt price moved in our favor yet. On the 25 calls here, you literally lost money so far. You are directionally correct entirely. You are completely correct in terms of your directional disposition. In terms of your PNL, you are fucked. You are right, but wrong. Why did this happen? What happened to the poor soldier at 15 know. Why would he be in such poor shape compared to the soldier that's at 17 Jan 25 same strike. Ruin to the says IV less so IV in this instance. IV would have contracted a little bit so definitely wouldn't help. But that's not the primary thing. Theta you got it. That's exactly correct. So the problem is as we fast forward at time. This thing has been suffering theta decay. And because it's getting closer and closer to expiration, it's theta decay is growing exponentially. Each day, this 15 know of 25 call is losing six dollars and 70 cents. Whereas the 17 Jan 25 calls is losing two dollars and 84 cents significantly less.",

And this because it didn't have a big enough move fast enough, even though it did have a good move, it still wasn't enough in order for it to break through. And make money. This is the problem with short dated options is that you really need a move and you need to move quick. And this is why I like to use longer dated options. So this is exactly why I didn't go to 15 know. And it's exactly why I was out in 17 Jan and it's why I'm out in 17 April. And I'm playing longer term ideas. And it gives the trade a much better risk reward profile by being a little further on time. So that's what happened there. So anyways, going back to where this sits now, the move from this last week. Again, it didn't even it didn't even start last week. And that's one of the funny things I see like where people were talking about, and I saw a couple of posts on super stonk about it.

And if you're looking at the move from the course of last week, you are, I don't want to say a day late dollar short, but you're definitely late to the party. Because if you look at here, it went from 22 to 25, but if you look at here, it went from 22 to 25. But if you look at here, it went from 20 to 25. Right. So you miss about half the move by catching it last week. Now again, that's not saying top ticking bottom taking it's impossible. But these kinds of days on expanded volume can't be ignored. That's all. And it's also a really important thing to note that just because volume spikes doesn't mean it goes up. There's a very specific reason why I didn't get into it on the 25th. And it literally did start breaking out, but it didn't go far enough for it to make sense. So all that does is gets added to a watch list for the next day. And then I say, what happens to the volume?

That's the way that I tend to look at this kind of thing because supply and demand always behaves in specific ways. It's not super predictable, but it does have tendencies that we can generally rely on. A car list says market makers will not let the price move up. They want your money playing call options is a good way to lose your money. That's not true. It's not true at all. Market makers make money by transactions. And they make money through your transactions by capturing the bid ask price. They can make a little bit more money if they're able to suppress price. But if you suppress price, then you have no movement. You have no movement. You have nobody that enters the stock. So it's really important again to try to remain objective. I'm not saying market makers are angels. I'm not saying market makers don't manipulate anything. I'm not saying any of that. But what I'm saying is that market makers do not have full control over the price of anything. It's a bit of a different context to remember. Again, we already talked about it at the beginning of",

The probability of a market maker manipulating the price here to try to drive this down with their buddies is super fucking high. I would not put it past them at all. But there's also a reality that the market maker didn't stop this from going from 20 to 23. They didn't stop this from going from 22 to 23. They didn't stop this from going from 23 to 25. So the problem is is retail traders, especially retail traders that are not familiar with options.

It looks like in general most of the money that he's made so far has been him betting that GameStop is going up. And holding through long durations and draw downs in service of that overall objective of GameStop going up. Because again, we've already talked about this. If we like you don't even have to look that far to see that if there was like this really supreme timing strategy. You don't have your portfolio cut in half or cut down by thirty one percent or cut down by thirty eight percent or cut down by twenty two percent or by twenty five percent. Right. Like if you if you have this way to rig the game in his favor as if we we think that that's a common theory. You don't go through that because it decreases how much money you can make it decreases how much pain you can put on the market makers. Whatever your you know whatever we think the incentive here is.

And again, I think the reason why he's able to do this is because this is money a small amount of money that was put into a yellow account into something that he could clearly see opportunity that he was significantly convicted and and ride the motherfucker out. And each time it started moving, he placed bigger and bigger bets and guess what he did he didn't place bets with stock.

The reason why this isn't seller boxing, at least from a functional standpoint, is a big part of seller boxing is you actually implement management that's complicit. So this, based on what I'm seeing here, the management was not complicit. The management was trying to figure out what the fuck is going on and they're trying to fight back.

This is meant to prevent naked short selling where a short seller does not actually borrow the shares before selling them lead into provincial FTD's FTD's mandates clearing agencies report them. Let's see the loophole's grandfather clause. One of the most criticized elements was the initial grandfather clause, which exempted existing fields to deliver before implementation for mandatory closing requirements. This allowed large amounts of short positions to remain unresolved options market maker exemption. Market makers and options contracts were initially exempt from locate and delivery believe that they needed the flexibility to facilitate trading. This is one of the problems like this. I don't like I under liquidity is important. But when it is the only guiding force for what we're doing, you lose transparency. It's kind of like the similar phrasing of anybody who I forgot the fucking who the fuck said this shit. It's something like anybody who over values security over liberty deserves neither some shit like that. I think it's Benjamin Franklin that homey. I forgot the exact saying, but it's something like that where if you prioritize security so much and it essentially becomes an infringement on liberty. So that's kind of what I see here.

Grandfather clauses gone options market maker exemption gone close out rule to for introduced to close out. FTD's mandated brokers must close out FTD's. By the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day after failure occurred to you plus four. It failure persisted that broke groupie restricted for making further short sales without first borrowing or ranging to borrow the security. That's actually kind of interesting because if you think of this as a forcing function, it's actually not really a forcing. Because all it says is that you can't short more.

SEC proposed regulation best execution is sure that brokers meet their duty to seek best execution for the customers orders, which we know they do not do. This is from something like payment for order flow. We know for a fact this doesn't happen. This proposal reflects a broader commitment to improving the integrity transparency of trading environment, including short selling practices. Requires certain market participants to disclose more detailed information about short sales. Public reports on aggregate short positions and that's interesting. Enhanced focused on FTDs. Increased scrutiny on FTD in the use of dark pools, tax-cute short sales. That's cool. The focus was on ensuring that rules surrounding settlement transparency. We're being adhered to like that. Technology data and like sub-editor track trading practices. That's interesting. Okay. Summarize this. I was wondering what kind of theories and stuff that we were going to be focusing on, but I can already tell you the very first thing that we are going to be focusing on is going through all of these.

How customers can discern between trusted compromise media outlets. Okay. Lucy emphasizes verifying claims with documented evidence and maintaining a record of media accuracy over time. Mainstream media such as CNBC may not always be reliable. We use like superstar provide valuable data based analysis often more informative. Yep. Okay. Complex options. Just create phantom shares by inflating the number of shares shorted without actual delivery. That's interesting. Explain number four more. Brokers and hedge funds use complex options strategies to synthetically create shares that do not exist. Such as buying shares while simultaneously selling calls or puts. These trades allow participants to create synthetic long. That can be lent out as if it were the real stock that's facilitating short shares without the actual underlying shares. Buying right by right transactions and resetting obligations. Buying the security sells a call on the security allows the trader to use the bot shares to cover a short position. While simultaneously creating a new delivery obligation through the call option. That's fucking super smart. Effectively bypassing the standard settlement requirements of T plus two. Am. Question.

How well understood are these things by people like in the community writ large. Like I'm curious. T.C.M. King says this is why cycles happens sort of I actually don't fully agree with that. The reason why I don't fully agree with that is because by going through this synthetic process. The way that I'm saying is essentially means they're like this can be done into perpetuity. Right. So it would actually be the antithesis of cycles. Because by doing this. They get themselves out of T plus two. And by being out of T plus two. They no longer. Are constricted right they they have used this loophole. And that's because if you with these loopholes that literally give them ability to do essentially synthetic locating. It essentially gets rid of the cycle theory because there wouldn't be a cycle because they're not beholden to the time frames. Maybe the Greek says been aware of this for three years, but I'm curious like.

I don't understand that with so many people looking at this. To me it seems like it would just be really logical that.

This is just an objective analysis like the thing that he messed up was this, but I also have no clue what I was doing now on hindsight. Right.

That's one of my favorite things about he and I because when it comes to belief systems, we are polar opposites because he's not just religious in a standard kind of religion like the type of beliefs that he has with his religion are like very specific and they're a little, I don't want to call it extreme.

It's just one of the one of the coolest things ever. Rointitty says, what does libertarian have to do with religion? I use libertarian not in the context of a political party, but libertarian is a belief system.

That's not to say like people aren't cerebral people definitely are. There's a lot of people that are super smart. But to find people that are like truly self reflective is completely different. Real intentions unclear. I thought he was just kidding, but he was being serious. Oh, this is perfect. Be excellent to each other. We're literally just talking about that. No. Boo. Both of these should be okay. Both of these should be okay. Damn. I just got straight up out of here. This magazine got me nuts. Golden, Jordan, Holberg. Look at this cat. Only you can prevent naked shirts. By like a butterfly hold like a bee. Did he hasn't changed? You've been holding for this long. So what's a little longer at the latest drama with the moderators of Oh, interesting of superstongue should not affect any ape strategy or shake. Simian confidence in the incredible turnaround underway. Game stop. The threat of witchcraft isn't enough to make anyone paperhand these shares from the diamond hand sub is just one of the",

The threat of witchcraft isn't enough to make anyone paperhand these shares from the diamond hand sub is just one of the ways apes communicate and share ideas. Oh, that's interesting. So this is like really. So the drama from the mods like clearly went live. That surprises me. I gotta look at this one. Content in this explosive DD is nearly as amazing story behind it. Okay. So it's just kind of like a preamble. I need to learn more about like the fucking mod drama. I've heard of different pieces of it, but I just haven't heard. Like what the what the beef was. And I'm also really sad that these stopped. Really like these. All right. So we got to save this page for sure. And we'll add this to our to do list. Because I guess this is what we're going to be going through for the next hot minute. We have a bunch of DD to run through. And then we'll figure the rest out. All right, guys, I'm going to go stuff my fat face with some chicken parms, some salad and whatnot. Be an ape outlier or an outlier ape. Whatever suits you best. Shout out to the 100 people that are here hanging out. Don't forget to like the video because it does help",
