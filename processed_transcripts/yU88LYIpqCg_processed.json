    "text": "You bought a call option in a couple days, the stock moves in your favor, meaning it goes up, and yet you're losing money. This happens literally all the time, and it's easily explained if you understand where to look. So the goal of this video is to walk you through this exact scenario where we place a trade. It does what we want, and yet we still lose money. And the goal at the end of the video is you will have a much better understanding of how to structure trades, but then also how to analyze your trades to figure out what's going on so that when you place future iterations of those trades, you can make sure that you're setting it up in a way that more directly aligns with your goal because nothing sucks more than being right and being wrong at the same time losing money. Super frustrating. What's up outliers? Welcome back to the channel. Let's get into detail. We're going to use this as an example in a little bit. Here we are looking at Nvidia. This is actually using thinkorswims on demand function. And this is back on 13 December of 2024. So not that long ago. And Nvidia was trading at 135. It's been trending up for some time. It had a little bit of a pullback after the dividend. And the idea here is maybe we think it's going to go back up. We're going to play out that scenario.",

And the idea here is maybe we think it's going to go back up. We're going to play out that scenario. Pin that in your mind. Now, first, we need to talk about the profit factors of an option. And in order to do this, we just need to revisit our friend very, very quickly. The black shoals, Martin model. And the reason why we need to revisit this quickly is because you need to answer some questions related. Not just kidding. You just need to know what the primary inputs are into an options price. So you can see if we take a look at the model, we need things like stock price, strike price, time to expiration, DTE. We need the risk free rate volatility and any relevant dividend yield. For options, this right here gives you insight into what things impact the value of your options, literally all of these. So we understand that the relationship between our strike price and the stock price will impact the price of our option. We know that the days to expiration impacts the price of our option. We know that the risk free rates, especially for longer dated options, we're not going to go deep into row in this video because it's typically not a massive factor, but it is one",

We know that the risk free rates, especially for longer dated options, we're not going to go deep into row in this video because it's typically not a massive factor, but it is one to be aware of volatility directly impacts the premium of our options and then dividend yield also does. So if we just eyeball some of these, we can come up with some pretty quick ideas as to how these might make a differing impact on our option, depending on what happens and in what scale. So there's a really neat thing we can do to better understand this and it starts with asking ourselves a few basic questions. First one is how does direction impact my trade? So if we go back over here for the start of our example, we're eyeballing out in 27 December, so a two week trade, we're looking at buying the 139 calls here. So in this hypothetical, we think Nvidia is going to go up and we're buying calls that are about a 40 delta. This allows us to benefit from the expansion of price and it allows the options to compound pretty quickly if we're correct. So if we have a long call, well, how does direction impact my trade? The beautiful thing about options is that there are specific tools you can use to measure the impact of different market forces. So",

The beautiful thing about options is that there are specific tools you can use to measure the impact of different market forces. So for example, for us to take a look at directional impacts, we can use delta, we can use gamma, and then we can use something like speed. So all of these tell us how the option is going to behave as the underlying price moves. So delta tells us the rate of change of premium per one point move in the underlying. We go back to this. You can see again, our delta is 40 cents. That means if Nvidia goes up by a dollar, the the premium of these options is going to gain by 40 cents. If it goes down, they're going to lose 40 cents. Gamma obviously tells us the rate of change of delta and so on and so forth. We're not going to go through all of these. I actually have a video that goes through the Greeks in detail. You can explore all of this there. But by asking ourselves these questions, we can understand if we find ourselves in the scenario where the trade does what we want, but we're not showing a profit, we then can identify why it happened.

Okay, so now let's fast forward time. We can start by going maybe to Christmas Eve. We're not going to go all the way to expiration because we know right at expiration, the options are going to be probably decaying away really fast. So we're actually giving this the benefit of the doubt in order to make the move. And let's pop over to the chart and let's see what happens when it uploads. All right, so you can see this is where we entered on the 13th, and then this is where it's trading right now. And we'll take a look at what the actual move was in just a second. You can see that it did go down, but then it did go up, and it ultimately moved in our favor. Again, we got in around 135 down here, and it's trading right now at around 140.

Well, they can kind of tell by the premise of the video where we're not going to be making money. Let's take a look at the current price. It's currently trading at 27627, and we had gotten in at a slightly higher price. So let's see what happened here. Let's take a look next at the trade that we entered. We got in at around 2.87. So this is what it looks like at the time of entry. We had a trade with the delta of 0.4 gamma 0.04. So this means for every dollar move, our delta is going to move by 0.04, and then it'll obviously update as it moves around gamma changes. Data, we're going to lose 14 cents per day. Vega is 11 cents. So as volatility goes up by 1, we gain 11 cents. If it goes down, we lose 11 cents. And then obviously as each day passes, we lose 14 cents. Our total premium here is 2.87.

And I just showed you the scenario where we know we're losing money. And what happened? Well, the stock moved in our favor again, around 4. We had a five in a quarter point move, in our direction, yet the trade is showing a loss of 10. So what went wrong? What happened here? Well, the first thing that we can tell is we can do a little bit of math. If we do some really basic math, and we essentially say, well, 11 days past that loses us 1.54, a five point move collecting and paying attention to both delta and gamma, assuming a linear rate, which we know is not true, then we have essentially 2.40 of profit. So why would this have lost money? Obviously, we would have gained 2.4 here, lost 154 here. Well, here's the rub. Data is not linear. Gamma is not linear. Neither is Vega. So what ended up happening with this individual trade is a compilation of the underlying moving against us in the beginning, which then requires a larger move in order for us to get back to break even and then into profit, as that's happening, that's consuming time, which theta decay, if you'll recall, accelerates as we get closer to expiration.

    "text": "compilation of the underlying moving against us in the beginning, which then requires a larger move in order for us to get back to break even and then into profit, as that's happening, that's consuming time, which theta decay, if you'll recall, accelerates as we get closer to expiration. That's actually one of the Greeks I showed you before. So if we rewind this, we entered on the 13th, let's go to the 17th. And let's just see how our theta decay and really the rest of the Greeks will update. And again, for reference, we started with theta at 14 cents. So let's see what theta is now. Amazing. Theta actually decreased. It's down to 11 cents. Why did theta decrease down to 11 cents? Well, it's because the underlying at this point in the trade moved so far against us that there's literally less extrinsic value. Notice the options only worth 83, 84 cents now. So because it's further out of the money coming up on expiration, theta actually has to slow down because there's just not that much extrinsic value left. So now let's fast forward one more time. We'll go to the 20th and let's see what theta looks like here. And what I'm showing you is to have a better understanding of how the life cycle of the option looks so that you can take better care when you're building your trade idea because what most options traders do and they say, well, I think",

    "text": "what theta looks like here. And what I'm showing you is to have a better understanding of how the life cycle of the option looks so that you can take better care when you're building your trade idea because what most options traders do and they say, well, I think this move is going to happen sometime in the next two to three weeks. So then they pick an expiration that directly aligns with that, which is a massive mistake. So let's see what it is now. We have the 139s and we can see that we recouped some value, but take a look at theta decay now. It's actually gone up. Even though there's less total value than what we started with, theta is now at 16 cents versus 14 cents. Why? Because we're getting closer and closer to expiration. Theta decay right now is accelerating massively. So now let's fast forward just one more time. We'll go all the way to one day before expiration, the 26th. And we'll see what our option looks like leading into expiration. And you'll notice again, a really, really important function because the option at this point is going to look a lot healthier. We're actually getting really close to being in the money. So let's see what it looks like now. And here's our option. It is one strike in the money. It's barely in the money. But if we take a look at the theta decay, it's now at 37",

It's barely in the money. But if we take a look at the theta decay, it's now at 37 cents. So it's massively high as a percentage of the total value of this option. So going back to this question, you were right. The underlying moved in your favor, about 4, but you still lost money. You lost money because of these other profit factors. And the fun fact, I didn't get into it to not go too deep in the weeds, but Vega actually helped you in this case, because volatility expanded as the underlying was going down, but it didn't do enough to offset the directional move. So this is why we need to build trades while carefully monitoring the Greeks, not just at the point of entry, but over the life cycle of the trade. And I have a video that walks through all of that in detail. We'll throw it in the notes below. Build trade smarter so that you're not in the scenario of being correct, but losing money. As always, if you have any questions, let me know. Be an ally. See you all later.",
