How do we figure out what to put into the market for us therefore then henceforth unto forever known be able to price? Kind of a carried away with those fun words. The question here though is where does IV come from? We know that it's derived from the market, so that means somebody has to input what we think implied volatility is. So where does that input come from? Dejean, Dejean is the closest so far by far the closest. Dejean says different pricing models, that's the closest. Re says best guess based on standard deviation. Travel Ursula says historical, Raphael says volatility. Nice job Raphael, glad to see that you're jumping in and getting right into the mix. We know we're talking about volatility. So right on. Okay. This is a really important point. We're going to talk about this more, but in oh shit, stop that. I try to use my pen and it like hung onto the little drawing pad one sec. Let's get us resented here.

I actually fully expected this, which is why this is a quiz question. Because this concept is actually very important. And we talked about it last time, but Lawrence says BSM that is incorrect. It's a good guess. Actually believe it or not, BSM is how we get this. So if we think about, well, we can answer number two while we answer number one. So first answer number two for me. What is the one unknown input into a pricing model? What's that guess? Mark says extrinsic value, that's not it. Good guess. Travel says we obviously missed it last time definitely. And the reason why I think people miss it is because it's a really subtle detail. That's easy to skip over, but it's an important one. Okay, beautiful. So Reese says, ball, good. Lauren says IV, which is actually more correct because for Reese's answer, and I know you're just typing quick, but ball can be different kinds of things. So Dejon and travel same comment to you guys.

Vol is not wrong, but when we're talking, when we're in like a basic setting, where we're working on getting the fundamentals down, this is where I try to make sure that we're using the correct language instead of common parlance, right? So you guys saying volatility, I understand what you mean. You mean implied volatility? That's just in common parlance. But the reality is there are lots of different kinds of volatility. There's realized volatility, future realized volatility, historic volatility. There's a lot of different kinds of vol. So we, in this context, the one unknown input to a pricing model would not be something like historic vol, realize of all, the one unknown input would be forecast. And the other acceptable answer is implied volatility. So, forward looking, that's the key takeaway here is we're talking about forward looking volatility. So now, how does IV differ from forecast? Really simple. Think of it this way. You go to weather.com and you see that it's going to be 50 degrees Fahrenheit. I guess I could just put a degrees. It's going to be 50 degrees Fahrenheit. You found that it's going to be 50 degrees Fahrenheit by going to a website and seeing what somebody else figured out based on whatever tools they have, the weather people, which they're not always super accurate. So who knows what fucking tools they have. Maybe they just do the rock outside the window thing. But joking",

It's a differential equation. So we just solve for the implied volatility component. That's where this number comes from. Forecast is akin to the weather man or woman. I am completely gender neutral when it comes to weather people, weather persons. And the weather, the weather people, they need to go out and they need to look at their barometers.

These are all of your different kind of garches, which there's E gar, EJ gar, there's gar, plus jump diffusion, there's binomial, etc, etc, etc. There's a million different, there's a million different kinds of models. All of these different kind of entities are attempting to try to figure out what volatility should be. They are forecasting it. They're using and maintaining their own volatility surface model. This allows them to come up with their best estimates for what the implied volatility for each in every option should be. So the way to think about forecast, this is typically institutions or professional side traders and investors, really institutions typically that are running analysis to actually try to price volatility. Whereas implied volatility is literally just looking at what an option is priced at and then backing out what the current volatility is based on the pricing. But the forecast ball is what's fed into the model. I'm going to take a pause here. We're going to spend more time when we talk about volatility getting into the weeds on this.

It's not based on anything other than that. Reses. So forecast is just anyone's forecast. I could have one. You can have a different one. Yeah, that's correct. But let's say that, and again, the way that the forecast manifests themselves is through the pricing of an option. When we're talking about the pricing of an option, it's really essentially us talking about volatility. Because if we go into an options chain and we look at the price of any of these, this is just looking at spy. When we look at all of these different options, we know all of the individual inputs that are going into this options price. Let's call it the 600 puts. We know the price of the underlying. We know the yield. We know that it's an American style option. We know that this is a put. We know the days to expiration. We know the risk-free rate. We know all of these different details.

When we're looking at the price of an option, we're literally, I know it's kind of esoteric. It's hard to connect the dots for people on this. We're pretty much just looking at volatility. We want to know what volatility is price that. It's because everything else is already known. The only thing that we don't know and the only thing that really this price is highly varied off of beyond those inputs that are standardized and known is volatility. This implied volatility column is literally just extracting out all of those known inputs. We're seeing what's left. We're solving for volatility. That's all that's happening here. To Reese's point before, anybody can forecast all. If I choose to go through here and I decide, my volatility model says implied volatility right now should be 11 as compared to this 10.72. My model in my world, this is low. Then I can make a bet off of that. Maybe I can come up with some horizontal trade to play the relative value of the 600 option and sell the 600 option out in 11, 12, 13, 5, if there's some other expiration works",

Maybe I can come up with some horizontal trade to play the relative value of the 600 option and sell the 600 option out in 11, 12, 13, 5, if there's some other expiration works too expensive or if there's option in the same expiration cycle, that's too expensive that I want to sell. I can just create a vertical spread. But the point being is if I'm maintaining my own model as a retail trader, I can try to come up with some ideas here. But the reality is the market is probably going to price these better than any of us can. I've tried to maintain a model and sometimes it's decent. But the just the reality is with as many market participants as there are and how much big money is in this, we're not going to price-volve better than what the market price is. It's just the fucking reality. So then we as the retail trading side of things, we essentially take whatever the implied volatility is and we say, this is probably pretty close to what it actually is. We don't know, but it's probably pretty close to what it actually is. So to recap that whole thing, forecast-volve is actually doing the work of figuring out what the volatility of an option should be. Implied volatility is when we extract the market price of vol from an option. That's",

Implied volatility is when we extract the market price of vol from an option. That's the difference. Dejean says, can I use Gamma exposure to create my own vol forecast? Completely different things. Gamma exposure is just an entirely different concept than trying to forecast-volve. The way that we forecast volatility, and this is why I use the weather analogy, it's not all too dissimilar from how we forecast the weather. And I use this analogy all the time because it's really good. I live in Southern California. Today it was 50, well right now, it's 55 degrees. So if I were to guess what the weather tomorrow in Southern California is going to be specifically the temperature, if I were to guess what the temperature is going to be tomorrow at the same time, 17, 15, what is my best guess? My best guess is that it's probably going to be something close to this. Probably something close to 55 degrees like it is right now, probably. Now we could have a stormfront move through and cause a massive change. In the volatility world, that's when volatility becomes transitory. But what we're talking about now is the propensity for volatility to cluster, just like weather clusters. And again, we'll get way deeper into volatility.",

I don't want to get too far down that rabbit hole in this session. But the main point is the way that we try and forecast volatility has a lot to do with looking at what the recent past looks like. And then we can use all different kinds of data injects, which is a big part of coming up with an accurate forecast model for volatility. It's not just figuring out how to factor in price shocks and things like that. It's also knowing everything about the stock. Is there any sort of news coming up that could potentially impact the price of this stock? And it doesn't have to be news that's tied directly to the stock. It could be news that's tied to an industry conference that's going on right now for medical devices. And the one company that is a supplier for medical devices can be impacted by one of the outputs from that medical device conference. And that's like a superficial example. It goes so much deeper than that to maintain obviously as accurate of a model as we can. So that's the difference between forecast fall and implied fall forecast is doing the work",

So let's clear all this garbage off. And let's take a look at a quick recap for episode three. Like I said, we're an episode four. So episode three and the reason why I don't show you this before we do the quizzes, because there's some answers in here like the first one options are price-pike consensus. So this idea that we're using black sholes, Martin model to then actually figure out how to price an option is that's a theoretical concept. It's not how it's done anymore. It's done by all of these different entities from an institutional side of things, figuring out what they think volatility should be priced at. All of them are interacting in the same market together that then moves the needle towards whatever market consensus is for what volatility is, thus what the price of an option is. We already talked about that we need a volatility forecast. I think we actually spend a while on that one. And we know that from a retail trading perspective, we derive implied volatility from the market. So there's",

Again, we understand them and use them from a theoretical perspective, but from a practical application standpoint, none of it matters. Whatever is priced in the market is probably what the options are worth. That's the idea. Solid recap. Now we get into trader organization. Let me update our time stamps. So we're at 2240. It's taken me forever to type this because it's like off to the side on the way that I'm sitting, which is actually kind of funny. So let's talk about this. This idea of trader organization. Now as always from military learning style, we always start with TLOs, ELOs. You don't get ELOs because I don't care about them. I care about TLOs. And this is the end state. At the end of this session, you should be able to complete these two tasks. The first task is to create your own millionaire roadmap, which we talked a little bit about in the planning section earlier on, but we're going to touch on it again quickly.

This is what we studied in the skill development session last week is this idea of creating a broader plan. Then the second thing you should be able to do by the end of the session is to be able to begin creating your own trading plan and supporting trading log. So we're going to talk about those. So the first thing, why do you care about this? Why are we talking about this thing? This isn't like this sexy part of options trading that is really actually if you think about it, kind of the boring, ugly part of options trading. This is why we talk about it. We talk about this because of Blue Waffle 135 from three hours ago. I sold a cash secure put on Nvidia the day before it crashed 20. They sold a 135 cash secure put 30 days out for 200 out of 25 delta. Now the cash secure put is at a unrealized loss of like 1500 bucks. How screwed am I? What do I do from here?

This is exactly why we plan to not be in this scenario. This is not a giant deal hopefully for them. But the reality is for people, the vast majority of options traders, this is what they do. They just start putting on trades and then they wonder why the shit doesn't work long term for them. So going off of this concept, this is a post that I made that talks about some different stuff. I want to highlight this, the third bullet point in here. The concept of this post, and this will be in a newsletter at some point, the concept of this post is what I consider to be some of the larger failure points for options traders. So the reason why we talk about the failure points of options traders is so that we understand what a lot of the common issues are so that we can do something else. Because as we talk about with respect to trading, if you want to be successful at this long term, you literally have to be a statistical outlier because the majority of people don't do it. So we need to understand what they do and then not do that. So this is one of the things that they do. They exhibit disgustingly common",

But the first reason why you care about this is because this is what the majority of people do and this does not work. That's why. The next reason why you care about this is because when we're trying to figure out how to trade options, we're interacting with a very complex system. Markets are complex options are complex. We as traders are complex. You have all of these different levels of complexity and all of these different interfaces. There are a lot of variables. It is very difficult to confidently track and know which ones matter and how much and how to manage them. So that's why I think this is worth your time. So let's talk really quick about some common misconceptions and questions. I shot this out and I got a few of these in. So I just threw them in here. At the end of these, you should have an answer for every single one of these. How do I know what I need to track? I don't think I need a written trading plan and",

Otherwise, if that's not the case, I massively failed you and I don't intend to do that. So if there's anything else that you want to make sure that we learn that we discuss along the way, throw it in the chat, it'll get added to this list.

Like what this looks like really doesn't matter. What matters is what information you can extract from it. The second thing on this list is the millionaire roadmap. So I'm throwing a link in the YouTube or in the chat right now so that you can see that video, that video walks you through step by step, literally how to create your own path. Whatever that path is. And what I mean by that is if we pop over to the website last week, we talked about the money mindset exercise. And we talked about trying to find a way to figure out how much money we need by what point in time in order to hit that financial freedom threshold. So then we need to then plan for that.

I got 20 years to go using a standard market return of 10 that puts me at 1.8 million. Then we can figure out if that's enough, depending on how you intend to withdraw your money and stuff like that, you have to go through this process for yourself to figure out what these numbers are. But what's important is this number, this number, this number, and this number to start. Meaning what is your starting investable principle? How much can you save? How much do you think you need in order to be financially free? What time frame are you trying to do it in? And then we get to take a look at the rate of return as we become traders. You don't get to change the rate of return upfront if you are a new trader. You don't get to have this. It's the same thing is if I am a brand new basketball player and I step on the court for my first basketball game, I don't get to say like I'm a drop 30 on their heads right now.

Not playing in that competitive level previously that maybe possible may not be possible. So I can have an idea of what I might want to do. But the market return is a great planning factor. The reason why I emphasize this point so heavily is because one of the most dangerous things traders do is they say to themselves, I'm a new trader, I'm two weeks into this. If I'm going to bother learning to trade, it should be worth my time. I determine it's worth my time if I'm able to make at least 30 per year. Well, guess what? One, you would have a, oh, that's 310. I was going to say it like that's a lot of money. You're still going to have a lot of money if you got that 30 per year. But the point I'm making here is like, it doesn't matter what you think you deserve. Literally nobody fucking cares. What matters is what your skill is able to produce going back to the basketball analogy. It doesn't matter if I walk on the court in my mind saying, I'm going to drop 30 on their heads.

So one of the big issues new traders have is they set themselves up for these crazy ass initial returns. And then in order to try to hit them, you have to place big trades. Not ready for big trades, probably as a brand new trader. So that's the issue that typically opens up here. So that's the second thing you need is that roadmap. And you need to have an understanding of where you're trying to land. And then the third thing is a trade log. This is a screenshot of one of the trade logs that I've been showing you guys for a while for the coverage strangles. And I actually have a video that's coming out next week. Maybe we'll do it this week. What do you think? I have a video about trading Bitcoin with options. And then I have a video about tracking your trades like a pro building a trade log. I'll switch these really quick, because I think it makes more sense to do the trade log video this week. So that will go there. This will go here. So now there will be",

So that will go there. This will go here. So now there will be a trade log video that's coming out on Sunday. And the trade log video is going to go through pretty much all of this through. Well, not incredible through pretty significant detail, especially compared to what most people are probably used to seeing. So these are the documents that we need. Now, a common question is how do I start? How do I start making one? I'll show you. I'll show you exactly how you start making one. What you do is you go to google.com or a word doc. And you open up a word doc. So this is a sample trade log template or trade plan template. All you need to do is start writing words. You start writing words. You now have a trading plan that's a work in process. The reality as we build these trading plans in trading logs, they are iterative. That means they are going to change continually. They continue to change. Right now, it's really difficult to see because this is like tiny text. But right now, my trading plan is 415 pages. It continues to change, adapt, grow.

It continues to change, adapt, grow. The thing to remember is I just wrapped up my 18th year of trading. I've been doing this shift for a long fucking time. So that's why there's so much stuff in there. So now we have an idea of why this matters. It matters because most traders just start trading. It doesn't work. And then they don't know why. This is typically why. The key documents that we're going to use are a plan. And it's not really a document. This is like the guiding concept of what we're doing. Then we're going to have a trading. I call it an investing plan because there's like stuff in real estate and shit in there too. It's not just trading. But call it whatever you want. You need a trading or investing plan. And then you need a log. So let's talk about the relationship between these things and why this is the order. I think it makes sense, which is something like this. One, then two, and then three. So we start one with our goals. We create our goals by completing something like the money mindset exercise that we did last Wednesday together on YouTube live together.

The millionaire roadmap then tells us we say I want 2 million within 20 years at a starting principle of 25k with savings of, I don't know what the numbers are to work out to 2 million. I'm just coming up with shit with savings of 1500 per month at 12 return. Whatever the standard market return is that you want to reference off of. We now have some very clear details on what we need to build. We need to build something that can return this provided that we can maintain this and provided that we're still okay with this. This is why the money mindset exercise feeds into the millionaire roadmap because the money mindset exercise tells us this how much money do we think we need. And then the recommendation I give to people is to have two numbers, the MVP, and then target or goal. MVP is financial freedom. The target is what you want, what you desire.

You don't have to do the soul sucking thing forever if you plan out this shit. So MVP, minimal viable product that's really from the tech world. This is when we initially crossed the threshold of being able to have true autonomy over ourselves. We should still continue working. We should still continue working. But if there's some big moral thing that you just don't agree with and you're still planning on going to find another job, but you can stand on your morals in the current job and accept the consequences. That's financial freedom. Then the target is being able to do kind of the cool shit that you like. A great example of MVP versus target desire MVP. Like I talked about being able to say no at work to something you don't want to do. Target desire is you want to travel six times a year every time you travel you prefer to fly first class. I sure do. It's way more comfortable. That's super expensive. And in general, first class is probably one of",

    "text": "no at work to something you don't want to do. Target desire is you want to travel six times a year every time you travel you prefer to fly first class. I sure do. It's way more comfortable. That's super expensive. And in general, first class is probably one of the worst possible uses of money beyond the comfort that it provides. So that comfort is at a true premium. You can still travel. You can still travel six times throughout the year. But if you add the requirement of wanting to travel more comfortably, because that matters to you, that's a desire. You don't really need that. You can still travel without it. But I can tell you on equivically, it's so much fucking better with it. It's so much better. And it's not because like the free drinks and booze and stuff like the seats being a little bit bigger is nice. That's a big thing. But it's also the you don't have to like worry about the fucking overhead bin space. That's one of the most annoying things because both my wife and I, unless we're going on like a dive trip, we just carry a backpack. We don't do check bags because you don't need that much shit for the vast majority of stuff. And to like have to worry about if there's going to be enough overhead bin space like fuck that.

And then I know there's going to be overhead bin space for me. Like it's a little shit like that. But again, the point I'm highlighting is it's still entirely possible to travel. Just fine. And worry about the overhead bin space, but you can make it happen. This is the difference between a target desire level metric to account for things like that that you figure out from the money mindset exercise. And MVPs simply when you have your financial freedom. So that's the goal setting section. Now that goal setting section, as we talked about, gives us some really important takeaways. So one of those takeaways is this return over here. We know what we need to hit. Okay, great. Now we have a planning factor. So then where does the trading plan come in? So step one to reiterate is goals that are quantified. Step two now is creating a plan. The purpose of the plan is to figure out this is going to blow your mind. Figure out a fucking plan to hit that 12 metric.

Or you might realize as you're trying to build what this might look like, the way that you thought you were going to do it might not work. That's the point of the plan. So now let's talk about the key sections of this plan. Where is oh, hold on a second. Perfect. So the first section of the plan and you'll see in the template that I have this is something I use somewhere else, but for the plan itself, we're going to have some key sections. We're going to capture our goals that are quantified. We're going to include the millionaire roadmap so that we have a clear target of what we're shooting at. Then what I like to have is kind of a portfolio management section. This is going to include my risk tolerance. Beyond portfolio management section, this is when we get into the actual tools.

So let's essentially take what we captured over here and put it into our log. So the log title, trading plan, whatever you want it to be. Now for me in mine, we're going to have a handful of sections. So what I'll do is I'll use a couple heading sections. We'll start with the title of the doc. The title doc will just be investing plan or trading plan whatever you want. And then again, for me, I typically have a quote. The reason why I have the quote is it's just a reminder for when I click into this. There's a few of them. So the first one is that's something my mentor used to say to me when I used to have different feelings about trying to make a bunch of money. He used to say to me, money can't buy a hot happiness, poverty can't buy shit. So the lesson behind that is money is an amplifier to your life. It can help a lot of things.

But if you as a human being are a nasty, ugly human being, not in terms of your looks, obviously in terms of your character and personality, money ain't going to fix it. If you're a good person that has a beautiful human being, like in totality, money is just an amplifier. So that's the first thing. The second thing is this. Financial freedom enables true freedom and expression. The reason why I put this in here is because it reminds me not just that making money is for the sake of making money to go buy cool shit. It's that money literally allows you to be unabashedly yourself, period. Whatever that is, hopefully it's a good person, but it allows you to be exactly what you want to be, who you want to be. You do not have to tip toe through the tulips with people to make them think that they like you to try to get a promotion. You get to be yourself. If there's some sort of cause that you really care about, but you're concerned what your workplace might think about you, if your workplace has a different disposition than your disposition, and you don't want to go apply to this cause or help this cause because of that, that sucks.

And the reason why typing is hard is because the keyboard's like off to the side here. Millionaire roadmap can go in here. We need portfolio management. We need profit mechanisms. We need analysis tools. If you're a nerd, you can have stuff here for like market functions, and history. And then we have strategy outlines. And then we have a our process. And then I normally will have RFIs near the top, or I will have them in like a separate word doc or notepad. I don't keep them necessarily in the plan because I don't crack open the plan every single day. Now why did I use headings? I used headings because it puts them over here so that as your document becomes 400 plus pages, you can click at them and it'll just take you to where you're trying to go.

Let's say that in my initial thought for my risk tolerance, I'm like, I'm okay with a 50 drawdown. Maybe I think that genuinely. And that's my initial idea. Well, let's take a look and see if that's actually the case. And I'll show you how we can do this. There's two things that matter to us here. The first thing is let's go back to this. We can get rid of all that stuff. Let's go back to this. We had our scenario where we had like 2,500 or 25,000. I think we were saving 2,500 per month. We had a 20 year runway. Yeah. So this is where we were. So I say, I'm okay with a 50 drawdown. So let's see if I'm okay with a 50 drawdown. Right now, it would take me 20 years to get to 1.8 million.

Of course. Why not? A small account is going to be completely, completely dependent on these savings. Now, let me show you another example though to help you understand this broader point. That's why you have to look at the numbers because the numbers matter a lot. Let's say I'm saving no money. And then I do the same thing. I cut the account in half. We go to 12, 5, 20 years. I'd have 168K. In 20 years, I have 84. So for a small account, if you are aggressively saving, you can get away with more of a drawdown. That drawdown becomes a bigger problem as your account gets bigger because then the incremental saving contributions don't matter as much if you have a big portfolio. So let's say you have a 500,000 portfolio. You have a mid-size portfolio. And let's say that you're not saving any money at this. Well, let's actually say you are saving. Let's say you're saving 1,000 a month. Notice the difference here. So for 500,000, 500,000 account, saving 1,000 a month, 20 years, you have 3.3 million. If I add this, you have 4.1.

So now let's cut this 500,000 account in half maintaining the savings. 20 years, 4 million, 20 years, 2 million. Do you see the point? The point I'm making is that with a small account, your savings matter more. With a bigger account or as soon as your savings comprise a smaller percentage of the total account value, the drawdown matters a lot. So now in that same timeframe, I have half the money. Probably not what I want. So then going back to this trading plan idea, this is how we actually assess our risk tolerance. It's not just a random number. It's not just sitting there thinking like, oh, yeah, fuck, what would I, you know, it would suck to see the portfolio at whatever. That's not it at all. It's seeing how different drawdowns impact your actual trajectory and your broader plan. I'm going to pop the door for thought. Mel is at the gym right now.

This essentially is the point where, let's say you decide that your risk tolerance is going to be a 30 drawdown. Your portfolio circuit breaker is going to kick on. I like 25. If your entire portfolio value is down 25 in proximity to your, to your total risk tolerance, the portfolio circuit breaker is designed to get you to go in there and start cutting fucking trades before you get to your risk tolerance threshold. This is how we stop catastrophic drawdowns of accounts. Then you can go into broader portfolio utilization rules and shit like that. Profit mechanism. I have a video that talks about this. We're not going to dive into the detail on profit mechanisms here. Here are that's one video about profit mechanisms. Guess who's back at the door? I fucking told you. So",

That talks about creating a strategy. But profit mechanisms are the things that you expect to make money from. You can back in real quick. So this can be something like beta drift. So this can be like a large cap. And I would define it. So beta drift in this context would be propensity for large cap box to steadily grow over time in an expanding economy. And then what I would do is I would list research. Where do you find the research? Great question from SSRN. That's the starting point. Another great example here is momentum. This is well documented. In so on and so forth. I would list out the different profit mechanisms I'm intending to trade. The analysis tools. I would break this out. To be guiding concepts. Then I would break it out into technical. And probably spell technical right. That would be good. And then fundamental. Analysis. And then I would also add things like market analysis process.

So we can have, and here's where I would actually use subheadings so that they'll pop up underneath here. So maybe we have a covered strangle. And then within the covered strangle, we already know the sections we're supposed to have. An executive summary. We need to set up. We need a management. Lauren says are there better strategies for smaller accounts? Well, as you know, better is relative. But I actually just put a video out not too long ago about trading options with like a 5,000 account. Here's that video for you, Lauren. There. Management. We need a AR process. And then we need RFIs. Now I want to linger on the strategy outline specifically. The reason why I want to linger on this is because this is where the trade log gets introduced because the executive summary for a strategy.

If you can't do that, it means you don't know what this thing is. So this is just a proof of concept to make sure that you know what this thing should be doing. So for example, the coverage triangle in this context could be designed to capture market beta or leveraged, market beta and amplify returns using short options, calls and puts. Done. Set up.

Well, the first thing that matters is the ability to assess or track if there's drift. So I'm going to list out the metrics that are important metrics that are important to strategy success. One of those underlying price movement. That's a big one. You can then go through and think if you were to click the button to enter a trade, what are the things you would look at?

What are your strategies? What do you do? And based on what's here, that's going to tell you how much money you might need to use at a given point in time in order to prospectively be able to hit that 12 return. For example, the coverage triangle is designed to capture market beta. Just standard market directional movements. We can amplify it with some leverage if we trade a leveraged ticker associated with it. I tend towards ETFs personally. If the market has a down year, guess what that means for the coverage triangle? It means it's not performing well. Now the coverage triangle will still perform better than just buy and hold in the market, but that doesn't mean it's going to give me this in a down year. So now I have an RFI. One of my questions I'm going to have to solve for at some point is how does this fit into my portfolio utilization during market down years? Now I have a question. I need to go think about and try to solve for someone and so forth. Now the AR process, I think I have, I don't know if I have videos, I'm pretty sure I have videos.

We probably did it on a live stream. The AR process is like a review process. So what I do is I have a weekly, monthly, an annual review process. And in this AR process, I literally just outlined the steps that matter to me for the review process. So the first step is portfolio, you know, track market, you know, for an assessment between the two, track strategy utilization, so on and so forth. So the AR process, I outline it so that it's not a unique unicorn every single time I do it. And the thing that you'll notice is that, and this is why I talk about the process of trading and the process of building things on the back end to support what we're trying to do as a trader. If you build the back end process, the function of actually trading literally is easy because all of the work is done here.

We're talking about up here, the management, the management cycle for a trade includes how risk management approach, profit management approach, time management approach. And so on. This is it. If you followed along and you did some of this work with me, congratulations. You literally just started your very own trading plan. And that literally is huge. It might sound insignificant, but that's a huge step in starting to build something that's logical, scalable, that's not based on randomness. That's actually purely decisions that are made on information, not pure randomness based on what you happen to feel at a given point in time. Any questions on this idea about trade or organization, and the question, goal setting, trading plans, trading logs, anything like that. The key takeaway from this is the most important part of this is starting. And if you start the process, it's iterative. Don't get overwhelmed, not knowing what to track. What happens to a lot of people is they don't know what to track, or they say they don't know what to track. So then they just don't track. That's a bad answer.

And you're able now to create your own supporting trade log based on the inputs we talked about. You need to capture by outlining what matters to the individual strategies.

And then there's a video coming out on Sunday that's going to go into trade plan. I'm sorry, trade logs in detail. So you can tune in for that one so that then you can figure out over the next couple days. What kind of strategies you run, what kind of metrics are relevant to that strategy. And then spend today and tomorrow brainstorming on that writing that out. And then as you're sitting there saying, well, I don't know how to fucking do this trade log thing. Then boom, Sunday, the light will shine down through the clouds. And there will be a video for you about building a trade log. And the video, let's see, the video's 25 minutes long. As we all know, it's pretty, you boy, you boy goes a little deep sometimes, but you know, just kind of what it is. Cool. That wraps us up for this. If there's any just general QA, anything from a beginner level perspective that you want to talk about now is literally the perfect time to bring that up. We can cover literally whatever you want. And while we're doing this, I'm actually going to do a little bit of homework, which my homework is to update our recap what we talked about. I like to do it right after we talk about it",

I like to do it right after we talk about it so that it is the freshest in my mind. And as you can tell, what we're going to do is have a list of these so that they will all be in the same spot forever. So we'll be able to look at all pretty quickly together. So what questions do we have? Like I said, anything, it doesn't have to be related to what we just talked about. Anything from a beginner level is totally cool. So this was a greater organization. This was what option pricing. This was buying versus selling. This was 101 recap. So now what we learned, we figured out how to create our own unknown. Millionaire road mapping process. The creation of trading, plan, outline and key sections. And then we talked about determining the key metrics. Jesus, you track from the plan in a trade log. That will be our recap for the next one. I think we can kill this thing. Let's see. Tommy says your thoughts on Elon saying there's a path for Tesla to being 20 trillion company at an earnings call. I mean, I don't disagree with them.

I just think it's a little bit of a reach, but it doesn't surprise me, you know, to see to see him say something like that, especially with the total potential impact that Tesla might be able to have longer term, and depending on how it evolves, because that's the other reality, is that Tesla is probably going to evolve significantly as the rest of the market evolves. So yeah, I mean, I think it's a little, I think it's a little dramatic, but also for a kind of guy, like he, you kind of accept that that's how he's going to talk. That's what he's going to be about. But I mean, Tesla as a company has looked a little bit rough, I think. The volatility in it has not been very good. Yeah, actually fell down below this. Funny enough. He's an earnings though.

So like, if you're doing like a long-term investment, there's not really a whole lot to track in terms of rationale provided that the rationale remains the same. Now, if it were me, what I would do is I absolutely would note when I chose to buy in. But if you're buying in on a regular scheduled dollar cost average cadence, then you already know the reason I wouldn't necessarily log that specifically. I would have a note in the log that says standard entry is blank date with blank amount of money. And then if there's a deviation off of that, for some reason, I would absolutely track that. The other thing I would track for that kind of position is whatever frequency you analyze the position, meaning if you look at it on a quarterly basis and you're like, do I like this position still? Do I not like this position? And how do you determine how you like the position? I would track that. So let's say for the last quarter, you track things like, again, if it's a dollar cost averaging position, I'm assuming something slightly longer term. So something I would track are the earnings.

You can start to get a sense of your different holdings, which are performing best over on a quarter by quarter basis. And is there a relationship to what the earnings report is? And then that can really inform how you funnel your money going forward. So yeah, the thing is, it stuff like this is whatever we want it to be. But what I can tell you is that if we're trying to make as much money as we possibly can, we have to think of it from that lens of how can I make as much money as I possibly can from this. And there's a process that we can logically follow to do that. It does require some effort though.
