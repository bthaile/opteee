    "text": "You'll find in trading there's rarely a discrete answer to a lot of stuff. For example, an option trading is that better to buy premium or sell premium. Well, it depends on a lot of stuff. So an important trait to develop is clarity in what you're trying to do. Say for example that you are trying to trade something directionally and you think it might have a really big move. It might make more sense to buy premium even if it's more expensive. Because the profit mechanism in that scenario is something that's going to move a lot. And if you sell an option, you're capping your profit potential. So it might not be a good fit. Don't default to things. Think through what you're trying to accomplish and then figure out what fits it the best. It's going to serve you much better than just saying, oh, I buy options. Or, oh, I sell options. There's a time for both. Be an all-eye. See you later.",
