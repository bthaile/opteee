    "text": "We already know that options add complexity to what we do. It's kind of the cool part about them. You can custom fit them to be exactly what you want. However, for newer traders, there is a big problem where we start to optimize for secondary intersharing inputs. Let me give you an example. If you are buying or selling an option, one of the things people spend way too much time worrying about is where volatility is. It's an input. It's important. You don't necessarily want to buy things unnecessarily expensive or sell them unnecessarily cheap. But in both of those instances, you know it's more important. Getting the direction correct. It doesn't matter if you bought perfectly priced ball or even better priced ball than what market should have been. If you're directionally wrong, your trade loses. So if you're trading single options with the directional disposition, your primary profit mechanism and what you should be optimizing for is direction. Then you can overlay those secondary tertiary factors. Be an dollar seal later.",
