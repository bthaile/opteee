    "text": "The amount of people that think they're gonna outperform the stock market, just by opening up a platform or jumping on Robinhood and starting to slings and trades. And then they're shocked when things don't work in their favor. It's kind of crazy, right? Like if you think about it, the stock market is really competitive. There's lots of super smart people trying to make a bunch of money. And it's the only thing that's insanely accessible literally to everybody. So if it's so accessible, why not take it seriously? Why not apply a similar methodology than you would to maybe if you're trying to start a business? Maybe instead of a business plan, you write out a trading plan. And instead of having pro-forma statements to see if your business might make money, you have a trading log where you can test and model ideas and then also track performance, kind of like an earnings report. It's the same thing you do in anything else. But the problem with trading is it's misleading, low-barrier or entry. People lose a bunch of money. Don't do that. Be an outlier. See you later.",
