    "text": "Always pay attention to what the market's doing because if you pay attention, you will notice all the time that there will be all kinds of personalities on X, on Reddit, on places like this, preparing for a crash, talking about a crash, talking about doom and gloom, meanwhile the market continues to steadily grind higher over time. The negative side of things is always appealing to talk about because it draws attention and for the person that happens to be right the one time out of 500 that they guess they're going to be praised as a genius. The reality is most people lose money, taking money out of the market, waiting for a massive crash that doesn't happen. Now the cool part about trading is we can position based on what's happening. So pay attention, don't listen to the noise, be an outlier, see you later.",
