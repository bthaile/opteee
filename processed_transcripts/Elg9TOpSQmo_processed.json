    "text": "How to instantly improve your trading without changing your strategy. It's really simple. Every single time before you put on a trade, you define profit and lost targets. This is where you think the underlying might go, depending on what strategy you're trading, whether it's bullish or bearish, and defining ahead of time. And then sizing the trade so that if it does hit your risk control, it makes sense relative to the portfolio value. If you do this literally super simple step, you will stop having that scenario where we call loss of version. Where it's we have a trade that's going against us, and then we become locked up because we don't like it. We don't want to realize the loss and then it just keeps going. And then we don't like it, so we're holding for hope and it keeps going and so on. That's bad news that it's not good for business. Be an dollar sealer.",
