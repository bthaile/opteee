    "text": "Well, well, well, what's up outliers? Happy Friday, great to be here with you all. I have everything set up ready for us to rock and roll actually a pretty light session in terms of presentation. Got to move the chat over here. So I keep an eyeball and also to say hello to everybody. So yeah, if you're here, don't forget to pop in the chat and say hi so that I can say hi back. I'm just like we have a handful of folks already to kick us off. I see there's Scott from earlier. I see Joseph Paul O'Tom fan of airplanes, Jay, lots of familiar faces, which is awesome. That's one of my favorite things about doing these. Shrejay Justin, Shrejay, it's great to see you, man. It's kind of the fun part, Rude of Bega. Can't forget that name. That's fucking hilarious. Zach, great to see you as well. Sweet. It looks like the the Gangs and Town. All right. So what are we doing today? Well, there's a handful of things that I want to cover. Milspek great to see you as well. In the past handful of sessions, we really have dove pretty deep into a lot of the basics of options trading. Kind of a lot of these random things that we should be aware of, how they work, how they're priced, those kinds of things. So what I want to actually look at for some of this session is threefold.

So what I want to actually look at for some of this session is threefold. The first thing is I want to take time to dive into any specific questions you guys have from any of the preceding sessions. That's the first thing. The second thing I want to look at a couple of questions that I've received previously, really two of them talked about the same exact thing and about five of them were about the same topic, which is this of defending positions. So we'll talk about defending positions. And then the last thing that I wanted to specifically cover today is looking at some trade examples. And I went back and forth on how I wanted to do that. I have a playlist on my YouTube channel about trade management, which is this one right here. So you can literally go through this playlist. You can find different strategies that I've used at different points and how I've managed different trades. There's also a couple other playlists that talk about management of individual style structures. So that's what this playlist is. What I'm highlighting is not to plug my own playlist. You guys are already on the channel. So plug in my own shit doesn't matter. It's mostly because I don't want to",

You guys are already on the channel. So plug in my own shit doesn't matter. It's mostly because I don't want to spend a bunch of time looking at positions that I've had in armchair quarterbacking them. So I thought what might be more interesting for that section is to take a look at either trades that you guys have looked at yourselves or trades that you have on. And the reason why I think that could be interesting is because it gives us an opportunity to look at something novel, right? Something that I can't already speak all the way through because I know that's happened because it's my own position. The other thing I thought we could do is go back into on demand, which we've tinkered with before. And in on demand, we have the ability to go back in time and to trade different perspective positions. And then the third thing I wanted to cover with respect to this options trading kind of position section is to talk about a couple positions that I have on now that are in progress. And the reason I want to talk about in progress positions is because I don't know what's going to happen with them. And me not knowing what's going to happen with them is an important part of",

And me not knowing what's going to happen with them is an important part of the discussion cycle about placing trades. Now the downside is there trades that I already have on, but I don't know what I'm going to do with them yet because I'm still figuring it out. So we have a bunch of different angles. We can approach that portion of this session, which we'll be looking at trades and actually to make sure that I keep us on track, I'm going to pop open a notepad real quick and jot down a few notes on how we're going to flow so that I keep us on track. So in the meantime, while I'm doing this, if you guys have relatively new positions or if you guys have, I'm sorry, if you guys have any specific questions that we want to start with taking a look at, I would love to start there. So we'll run through our QA and then obviously the QA throughout the entire session, whatever there's something we're talking about that you want to learn more about, you just tell me. But if there's any specific topics that you guys want to start with, this is a great point to do that. Then we'll get into defending positions,",

I think one of them is almost two hours. So all right. Timmy Peparoni, that is a hilarious name. Timmy Peparoni says, New here, just start off trading options a few weeks ago, feeling slightly overwhelmed. That sounds about right. I have, let me grab something for you specifically quickly. There's, I made a guide for people literally for this exact reason. And it's not, it's honestly not finished yet. I've told you guys this before. It's definitely work in progress, but it's something that I'm trying to use to like build out for you guys.

Hedgehog. Yo, these are cool animals. Okay. So the dinosaur is idle. There's a chipmunk. I like this bat. That's my favorite so far. And so anyways, you'll see that I kind of organize it into a couple primary clusters. That's what's noted in this section over here. These are just broad overarching topics that I think apply. Then I list primary learning objectives for each of them so that I think these are some of the more important components to take away from these. Click admin note. There's way more to trading than this. My goal, however, is not to add so much information to grossly overwhelm people. The reason for that is because there's no shortage of information available at this point. It's different than when I started. When I started trading, you were very much limited by the data you could find about options because there wasn't that much of it. Now it's the opposite. There's a million things that you can find and you don't necessarily know which one's good and which one's not.

I add that caveat because this is not everything that goes into this. These are just some of the really big blocks that are here. On here, I offer some books that I would go through and order. I highlighted five of them that I think really, really makes sense to take a look at depending on your perspective and what you're trying to do. Then down here, I listed just some general steps, what I would be focusing on in order. I offer an outline of what I do and now I realize that this is not lined up with that. My OCD is just overwhelming. So we have to move away from that. And then on this page, the outlier options trading syllabus, the point of this page is to tie resources to each of these components.

I think that we can also look at it Monday or we can go as deep into that stuff as we want. Rootabaga says, I don't even know what defending position means. This is a great question. It's actually a giant misnomer in my opinion. I think it's when traders are so scared of booking a losing trade that they have to call it something else to make themselves feel okay. So rather than saying, I took a losing trade down and I'm putting on a new trade or something like that or I'm adjusting a position we call it defending. But there's nothing inherently wrong with defending a position. The concept of defending a position is when you have something that's on and it's not going your way. You can do things in options like adjusting around the position and that's actually very cool about options. It's a unique thing that they offer. I don't love again calling it defending. I prefer to call it adjusting, but that's just semantics. So the main thing I draw the delineation there though is to try to avoid the emotional depth that goes into defending versus adjusting. It is pedantic as that might sound. There's a big difference",

There's a big difference between the psychology behind those two maneuvers. So I draw the distinction between them for that reason. Okay. Back up here. Elon Song says managing a trade synthetic long, CLSK, Jan 17th, 25, 75 calls. I sold out of the cash, I sold out of the cash secure put leg in order to free up cash waiting for 19 to 24 top to sell these. Okay. So first off, Elon Song's, I would absolutely remind you that synthetic stock, synthetic long is kind of a specific thing. So it looks like what you have is a long call. And again, this isn't to get overly pedantic, but this is we're talking about the fundamentals of trading, which is absolutely important to differentiate. So if I grab CLSK and we look at your example and we look at the 17 Jan 25 here, we go to the 7.5 calls and we analyze this trade a couple things. This is actually not synthetic stock because of this just to be very clear. If this was a synthetic stock position, we would have some sort of short put component added to it. Now this is synthetic stock just to be clear. And again,",

And again, I'm not, I'm really not trying to like point this out to be pedantic. I'm trying to point out to make sure that we're being accurate because I know a lot of people that consume tasty content, which again, I love Tom Big fan, but I think it can muddy the waters when we use the term synthetics in places where it actually doesn't make sense. Elon Song says I already had, I originally had that short put. Now I just have the long call. Yep. Okay. So point though, exactly to your point that your position absolutely started as a synthetic, is synthetic shares. But then now it represents a long call is all and that's okay. The again, the only reason why I'm drawing the distinction, especially because clearly as you're talking about it, you know that difference. I'm drawing the distinction for other people that might not know the difference because as you guys may or may not know in the trading space, we use a lot of terms in different ways. And there's a lot of colloquial uses and then there's a lot of kind of like super accurate uses by definition of sorts. So I'm",

So this is synthetic long down here. Now our position is long calls. So going back up though to your question, waiting for 19 to 24 to sell these. Let's see. I think that's so we're talking about managing long calls to be very clear about kind of this section here. And the first thing that I would do is see what I think about the underlying because I think there's nothing wrong if your target is something between 19 and 24. That's okay. And it looks like it's generally oscillating in that direction pretty slowly, but it's also important to remember that there is an opportunity cost to capital and you kind of need this thing to do what you want it to do. And just because we want it to go there doesn't mean it's going to go there. So the next question I would have for you, Elon songs, is if it doesn't go there, what is your management approach? So let's say for example, as I'm just kind of eyeballing this, let's say for example, it starts to go down to whatever degree that makes sense for us.",

But what's the move there if it starts going down? Elon song says what I'm confused about is how quickly Theta or valuable melt versus selling it. That's a great question. And then Elon song says what that's what I don't have clear if it goes below 15 all close. Yes, literally perfect. So the very first thing I would offer to you is whenever we place a trade literally every single time we need to have profit and loss defined before entry that before entry component is so important. It's because it is one we are the most objective we can possibly be as a trader is at that point before the trade is on before the risk is on before any emotion before any hopes dreams enter the equation before all of that in my opinion is just it's a non-negotiable. I have this corny little saying that I use that I actually believe in though to a pretty significant degree, which is in trading, there's so much bullshit right people will say, well use this one indicator and make a good 1 trillion or all you have to do is trade for five minutes a day and",

Like it's all bullshit. But there's one thing that's legitimate and there's one thing you can do that will legitimately transform your trading and that is defining your profit and loss before you enter a trade. Because if you do that and you track it and you will be able to observe trends that can then feed your system to then optimize the system. So the very first thing is to do that. Now that that points aside, let's answer your specific question though about how quickly theta will impact the position and then just in case you guys didn't know YouTube wants me to insert an ad now it says now's a good time. What you guys already know the answer to that the answer is we hit close and I finally have learned how to not let YouTube do this. So there's another thing that it pops up that says focus on your live stream and let YouTube insert ads for you. I'm pretty sure that like YouTube hates me because I actively turn off all of these ads. It's kind of actually hilarious. So I don't want to disrupt you guys with it,",

And for anybody in the chat that knows can you walk me through how we can answer Elon Song's question specifically about how quickly the theta or value will melt versus selling it, which is a great question. How can we do that? There's a few things that we can easily do. The first one is navigate to our options chain, get rid of this. So what can we do in here? So that means that it's actually quite, quite spelled out for you. You go right here, you go to the option chain and you look at theta. That right there tells you exactly the answer to that question. So that means ceteris parabis, everything else remaining the same as a day passes, you will lose a penny on your options. Now again, it's not a penny, right? It's a dollar because you got to, it's per share. You have to multiply it out by a hundred. That's what it decays on a daily basis, everything else remaining the same, a buck. So this is essentially the cost of leverage for you. That's what this",

Rudeabag has a great question. Does theta change over time? Fantastic question. And I actually preemptively expected these questions, one like that, and I grabbed this. Here. So this is theta decay in the top right. So to answer Rudeabag's question, does theta decay change over time? Absolutely. And this is exactly how. So as you get closer and closer into time, your theta decay, theta decay will accelerate. And we can look at an example. One of the things that you'll hear me talk about when I'm analyzing options chains is this concept of surrogate options. And I actually don't know if that's proper at all to use. I've used it my whole life, but it's exactly what I do is I use different options to simulate different scenarios in my brain. Now as special as that might sound, let's take a look at these seven and a halfs and let's pretend that we hold those seven and a halfs until the equivalent of the 20 December expiration cycle. So what that means is I would simply pretend that time has passed. And rather than our options having 190 60 to E, this 17 Jan expiration",

So I'm going to look at this one. And then I'm going to see if there's seven and a halfs and there's not, which is kind of annoying, but it doesn't really matter because I can also just take a look between the difference between seven and eight to get a sense. So what I'm looking at is where does my theta go in this scenario? What happens to theta if essentially this time frame passes a little over 20 days or whatever? And we can see theta if we wait for 20 days is still essentially a penny a day, dollar a day in total. So you can do this to get an idea of what your position might look like as time passes. Now there's not always perfect, right? Like your seven and a halfs are not in here. So you can't do that to the same degree in here. So this is one way.

Another way to look at this is to go into some sort of risk profile tool. You can either make your own. It's very simple to do genuinely in Excel. It's not difficult to model all of the different Greeks for an option given a certain amount of information. You can eyeball what the total theta of a position could be or you can just fast forward time. So you can say right now we're looking at the 5th of July if we go fast forward two days. You can see this line is moving. It's just not moving very much because the theta is so low. So if I zoom this in really, really far, that's what I'm doing by kind of this annoying dragging process. I'm zooming us in almost to a microscopic level. I just want you to be able to see this line move as I click the days. So this is the 5th of July. Now watch as I fast forward time. Watch that purple line. Notice how it moves. I just fast forwarded us 20 days. That's how much it moved over the course of that 20 days.

And that's essentially what I would do. If I wanted to know how much theta am I giving away or getting chewed up by this is exactly what I would do. I would just go into the option chain and I would look. I would say, okay, I have the 7.5. There are 91 delta. I know something that's really deep in the money is going to have less extrinsic value. It's going to decay less quickly. I'll take a look at the theta specifically. This is a penny a day. And you can even get this out down to a third decimal place if you want in something like thinkorswim so that you can see like more precisely what it is. But I would look at that and say that's simply not much. That's the cost of my leverage. So that is the overall process I would follow. And Elon songs if you have any follow-ons to that. Let me know.

If you want to analyze options, chains like thinkorswim here is what I use. But you can use a bunch of other stuff. IB interactive brokers has their platform. Fidelity has their own platform. I'm pretty sure I think they even have one that you can download if I'm not mistaken because I had some capital with them at some point.

The only difference I would offer you when you look at the bid and the ask is more often not. It's actually the same person. It's a market maker that's resting orders. And they're essentially saying what they're willing to transact at. That's what this is. Now you can even go a step further if you're so inclined and you can add up here, another tab would be the size. And you can see what market they're specifically offering. I'll see if I can add it without like completely crushing how deep this is already. So there's the size. It's kind of difficult to see and it doesn't look like this lets me expand the window. That's slightly annoying. Maybe if I hover on it, perfect. So in this case for Elon songs position actually, if we look at it right now, it's bid at 950 offered at 980. The difference between these is the bid asked spread. And this is predicated on the market maker and what they're willing to offer you.

It's because they might have a different perception of risk or depending on how the rest of their book looks like, they might want to take a different profile. These are not in the context when a market maker is offering you a position. It's not in the context of this one individual strike. They are looking at it from the perspective of their entire book. What makes sense based on my entire portfolio of shit and what I'm trying to do with their risk? That is what a market maker is most concerned with is managing their risk effectively so that they can capture their primary profit mechanism, which is the bid asked spread. So that's why you'll see different numbers here. You'll see these numbers move. They can spoof orders. That's more for high frequency trading. I'm kind of bastardizing the term for this. But essentially they can flash orders that don't actually represent what they want to trade at.

But just general context there. So when you're looking at the bid asked spread, that is the way you're looking at it is exactly correct. The bid is what you could sell something at right now. The offer or the ask is what you can buy something at right now. Now, most traders, especially on the retail side because we tend to trade in much smaller size on a relative basis, you should always target the mid first or even something that's slightly advantageous to you. So what that means is let's say that like Elon songs, I want to buy this option. Well, I know I could buy it at 980. I want to pay 980. I want to I know that they're building themselves a big buffer here. So I'm going to be a cheap bastard. And maybe I'll come in at like 955 or 960.

Well, I'm sacrificing speed of fill. I'm letting my order be known by the market. So then they could slowly ratchet the price up if they want. They can adjust their market as I'm adjusting my order. So that's the perspective downside. But in general markets are pretty competitive. So you're not necessarily going to give up a whole lot. The main thing that you're giving up there is speed of execution. And if you're not in a giant rush, that's okay. You can give up a little bit of speed. So let me know if that answers your question.

Like, the chance of getting filled between the bid asked spread is actually very high. You do not need to go to the extremes. That's the only time you would go to the extremes, meaning transact at the bidder offer is if you need to trade right now. It's like submitting a market order. I need something right now. If you take any time to play the bid asked spread, you'll overwhelmingly number of cases get a fill somewhere in there. So maybe you don't get exactly at the mid, but maybe you get something a little towards the offer, but not the offer itself. Like that, that'll happen literally all the time.

If not, we can dive into that way more deeply on the Monday live session. Happy to do that. Peyton says, can you explain how somebody in 1123 correctly predicted the stocks recent movements based off of some log view of the chart? I don't understand your question at all. It's, yeah, Peyton, could you clarify your question a bit because that one does not make sense to me? It sounds like you're talking about somebody back in November of 23 predicting a stock movement that recently happened. And if that's the question, I can absolutely work through that with you. But the answer's probably going to disenfranchise you. Tampa Bay says Eric love the test and profile, USNR and some for five, brother. Well, Kassali, can you please show me to place a limit order in toss? Sure. Really, if you want to place a limit order for shares, it's just down here, limit. And that's it. There's your limit order. If you want to do it for options, it's the same exact thing. So by this limit order and then input the price that you want to limit at right there. Ruta Bay says does theta change over time? It does.

So theta as we were kind of talking about. So if we look at the surrogate option scenario, if we go way out here to 560 days in this and we look at 91 delta option, the theta is literally so low, you need to go to a third or fourth decimal place to even see it. So then if we come in here to 18 July and you go to that same 91 delta, you can see it's the same scenario. It's so far out of the money you need a third decimal place. Then if we come in here to 17 Jan, now it's out of penny, you can see it. Then if we fast forward to 42 days, you'll see now it's at two pennies. And then if we come in here to 14 days to that same 91 delta, which is somewhere probably around here, it's four pennies or so. And the reason why it gets lighter is you go further in the money because there's less extrinsic value to even have theta to K. There's so far in the money. So yeah, theta definitely changes over time. Ruta Bay says so basically theta is a function of time and has nothing to do with the stock movement. Not necessarily. Because",

Ruta Bay says so basically theta is a function of time and has nothing to do with the stock movement. Not necessarily. Because theta is a function, theta measures in options decay due to the passage of time. But theta applies to the extrinsic value of an option, which is dependent on the stock movement. So that's the tricky part. When you talk about options in general, is that there's a lot of correlations between things. You talk about individual concepts in a vacuum because it's easier to understand them if other things aren't changing. But yeah, so theta in a vacuum simply measures the passage of time and the impact that that has on the premium of an option, that's absolutely correct. In a practical sense, theta applies to extrinsic value, which cares tremendously about the movement of the underlying. So I wouldn't decouple them mentally is all I'm trying to explain there. Joseph Apex writes as what platform this is thinker swim. Joseph says so when Roryne Kitty made those crazy gains on his options, people said he didn't have enough money for them. This has me confused. If you make gains on options, you have to have money to buy them. No, you absolutely don't. Yeah, you don't have to worry about that at all. So what those people are",

Yeah, you don't have to worry about that at all. So what those people are referring to is the ability to take assignment. So let's say for example, using this same ticker since we've been on it for a hot minute and why not. Let's say that Elon Songs has a one lot at seven and a half. Well, in order to put this position on, she's using 965. That's all it takes to buy this option. However, she has access to a different size position. So when you're looking at two, there's two different scenarios. You have whatever the cash secured amount is for an option. And then you have whatever the option is trading for. Now this is an anomalous trade. And the reason why this is anomalous is because there's more intrinsic value baked into these options than is actually here. And that happens in really extreme cases. And I don't want to get too too stuck on that point. So let me use something a little more appropriate to at least share that specific point. I'm going to use something that's cheaper so that it doesn't have as many spots, meaning decimal places so it's less congested. Why the freak disease have super weird options? That's annoying.

But let's go along with this example. If you buy this option and you get it at the mid, you're paying 520. It gives you access to 3,700 of shares, right? Because this is per share. Now when you buy an option, you don't have to have the 3,700 to take this position. That's the leverage gained by options.

So the modules just break down the topics into sub topics is all it makes it I try to organize a little bit is all.

And yes, I do trade peed for sure. Absolutely. Is it a part of earning specific allocation or what does it sit similar question for long straddles 10 days before earnings announcement? Yeah, great questions. So P is definitely part of a drift momentum play for me. It is absolutely after the fact.

It also had a significant beat on expectations. It came in at 6.12 versus 5143 expected. There's very specific criteria that go into post earnings announcement drift. So this ticked some of those boxes. And then the hypothesis is over the following quarter, you tend to see out performance given those conditions. So yeah, and you can also trade post earnings announcement drift to the downside. It's not always positive. A lot of times I'll refer to it as positive earnings announcement drift because that's kind of the lens I typically trade it through to the upside, but you can trade post earnings announcement drift to the downside. But there's specific criteria that have to be met that tie to gap of the position, meaning gap on the release.

I think I have a screenshot somewhere from the OIC on this exact topic, but I want to make sure about the settlement of options. Here we go. And now I did. Yo, I'm like a freaking encyclopedia. Yo, look at me. Go. Got to shift for everything. So this looks at the settlement of options. And it says, you'll hear people mistakenly cite literally all the time. Most options expire worthless. This is why you should sell them, which is literally complete trash. It's not accurate. 72 of all option contracts are closed out prior to expiration. So the overwhelming majority of options are traded. This is the primary way that we close options positions is by trade. It's just way more efficient. There are 22 that expire worthless.

So the vast majority of instances we want simply to trade the options. There's a bunch of reasons why it doesn't make sense to exercise. From the option buyer's perspective, you give up any residual extrinsic value. So if we go back to Wells Fargo. And let's say that you bought these 60, let's say you buy something that's in the money, something that has intrinsic value. Let's say that you have these 18 October, 55 calls. And let's say that you bought them for whatever. Something cheaper than what they are now. Let's say you got them for 5. And let's pretend Wells Fargo's gone up a bunch and you're making money. So what you don't want to do unless you really want the shares is exercise your options early. Why do I say that? What can you find from this scenario? Why would that be disadvantageous? Other than the fact that perhaps you really want the shares. And there are absolutely new on circumstances where it still can make sense.

And you're doing an incredible job so far. It's exactly correct. You give up the extrinsic value. This is actually why going back to a GameStop example. I don't think Warren Kitty exercised his options. The reason why I don't think he exercises options is because he would have given up over 3 million in extrinsic value that he could have recaptured by trading the options. Now there's always competing interest. You could say, well, I really don't want to deal with buying options. If the market's going to move a lot, if there's low flow, I just want to exercise in this case. And that's okay. You can do that. But you are absolutely leaving money on the table when you make that choice. So in that case, you would be sacrificing optimizing the profitability of the position for a convenience-based reason.

And if you go to down here where it says options 101, there's literally a playlist, the very first one. And fun fact, this options like introduction video, the one that's pretty long. I have a new one that I'm trying to launch next week. Literally that I shot all the way straight through. It's an hour and 40 freaking minutes that I just sat in my office talking to myself about options. It's crazy. But I'm trying to turn that into like a really, really good staple video that I'm proud to put in front of you guys. The last one that I did, the last couple that I did, like they're okay, but they're not, yeah, I mean, I'm not proud of them. So Zach says, love it if you go over your GME option purchase from today. I did not purchase any GME options today. I've had a GME position for a little while now. I got into. I'll tell you one. Well, it's loading. I'm looking at thinkorswim on the web base platform. Here we go. And then you can't search. Here we go. And then I'll just show you on the chart. I want like a three month something easier to see rid of all this stuff. All right. So we were in.

Right here and here these two spots. So the 20th, the first. And then the second as well. That's when this latest position's been on. But I've told you guys before Zach says my bad misunderstood video. Yeah. So the reason is is like when I'm doing stuff like this, I use an IRA account that has no money or no positions in it so that it's not messed up by all my positions. Because a lot of stuff that I have on, like it lights up like a Christmas tree and it gets really noisy and especially like when you're clicking into things. So a lot of times when I'm making really any video, I use this this account that I use for passing through money to other things. So that's why sometimes you'll see like the position thing there and sometimes not. So plus the other thing is I just don't like the idea of people trying to like follow what I'm doing.

I shared that with you in the Excel document in the chat. You can grab that. Scott says why is slapping the ask considered more bullish or is it necessarily it's considered bullish because it just means that you're trying to get in in a pressing amount of time or you want to get in at size. So you're not even trying to play the mid. You're just immediately going in and you're playing the offer and you're scooping it up for whatever they'll give it to you for. So it's like the same thing if you're trying to liquidate a position and you go through and start submitting a bunch of market orders that typically is is fairly telling the other thing is when you're analyzing options chains, whether we transact at the bitter offer is just informative in terms of telling us where",

Right. If you watch the GME video today, I use that exact tool because you can't tell like if I just go into this options chain and I look at the 24,519 calls here in GME at 25. Now because it's GME and I can make some inferences, I have some ideas is to whether or not these were bought or sold. But let's just pretend it's a different product, a different name. You can't tell if these 24,000 options were either bought to open or sold to open and based on that difference, you want something different to happen. If you bought to open, you want them to go up. If you sold to open for the option specifically, you want it to go down. So using things like analyzing where options are transacting at helps us understand. So for example, these 239,000 calls that transacted today in GameStop, they happened at the bid or below. You can't buy at the bid. You can sell at the bid. So this tells me that 37 of the volume today were people selling calls, which doesn't surprise me because if we take a",

These are people exiting options left and right to try and unwind their position because they're trying to salvage what value they can because it's the last day and most of them are going to expire worthless. So that's how you can kind of use that to understand what's happening with the transactions. All right, back up to the top. The chosen one, great name. What is the most important factors you should know before committing to a long options play like two, three months out? I have a video for you. And I actually made this video for specifically the GME folks, but it applies to anybody. It's just about buying call options smarter. I'm going to drop this in the chat for you, the chosen one. That video will walk you through the exact process. The reason why I'm giving you that video is because it's kind of a detailed answer. So there's not like an important factor in my opinion.

But beyond that, there's a million, not a million, that's dramatic. There's quite a few other factors that matter, but they're not, no one of them matters the most necessarily. They have a lot of different weighing factors, which if that's an example that you all want to go through, let me know. And we can, like we can go through an example of buying a call option. I'm completely down to do that. Ravish. Is there a good idea that someone may put how to manage risk if it goes against us? That's a great question. So there's nothing wrong inherently with selling naked puts. They have a place, but I think they need to be treated with respect. And I unfortunately think a lot of people on places like this on like fate again. I think these people just really, really miss out on a lot because they get too focused on selling options.

And they're being supported because they posted it in a community that wants to bolster this thought process. This is not because they bought options. This is a complete attribution error. This is not because they bought options. This is not because they sold options. Might have been the strategies they were using. That's not what results in this. You can buy an option or sell an option. And if the correct profit mechanism isn't there, you lose money. So in this example on the selling options, if they're selling puts in this scenario, they could buy calls and do this or better if they're buying calls smartly. Same thing on this side. If they're buying calls and it's not working, selling puts wouldn't magically fix this. So this is an attribution error. It's not as simple as this. So when I think about the process of selling naked short puts, it's completely okay. But you have to have a broader thing that that's aligned to. The process of just selling short puts doesn't, it doesn't matter, right? You need the profit mechanism first. So the way that I think about this exact process is I have a video on",

We have to, we have to might check ravish, see if ravish is here. So we can finish this example with him or her. I can't tell what the name ravish. It could be either or ravish.

So go back to 15 November 23. And we will look at Tampa, Tampa, I don't know, it's up to you guys.

Okay, now let's take a look at this example though. On the difference between selling calls or puts, because I think I do think that this is a good example. And since ravish left us, I am down and I need to make a series of assumptions for them. So let's say that we want to sell naked puts in here, because we think that this thing is going to go up. And let's say that we apply, uh, origin says go tasty works route, do the theta decay selling 45 close to 21 days. Yeah, that's, that's okay. We can simulate something like that here.

I really just want us to look at the prices. That's why I have this. It's a place for me to keep to keep both the prices while I move the time forward. So now let's fast forward. What? Two weeks. We'll give it two weeks. We had a bit of a pop. So we got in somewhere right around here. I actually already forgot where we entered exactly, but it went up that we know. So if we go to the analyze tab and we see where we originally transacted in these, right? So we have three 10 and then 64 cents.

It just doesn't want it to go down. So all the way back to the original question, is there anything wrong with selling puts? Absolutely not. I think that there needs to be a clear plan in place. Like if I'm trading something directionally, I'm not going to sell puts typically. And it's because I don't want to cap my profit. However, I much prefer to sell puts as part of trying to trade puts queue, trying to trade volatility versus with variance versus premium, trying to play earnings collapses, stuff like that. So there's nothing wrong at all with short puts. I like them, but they have to be bucketed at least in my opinion logically. So yeah, that's the way I think about that one personally. Rudebeg says they to people often say that selling is safer, maybe not naked. I mean, less risky. It's not. It's a completely misguided concept. And it's because they focus too much on win rate. And they don't focus on expected returns. So the reason why a lot of them would argue that it's safer is because they win more",

It doesn't matter necessarily how often you're correct. That's only part of a very important question, which is that of expected return. So yeah, good question, but not correct. Like not a correct way to focus that I should say. I back up to the top. Let's see what we got. Budget spinner says could you cover GameStop price action in the last two days and show how where market makers hedge and how it moves the price? I mean, there's not much movement here to show you. I would be down, but there's just not. It's been flat the last two days. I don't actually think the market makers are doing much, much hedging at all. I mean, look how light the volume is. The volume is like a neem at this point down to 13 mil. When it's more active, it's like 35 plus. So I don't actually think that this is a great example right now of like price action or where hedge or market makers might be hedging to be honest. It just looks kind of kind of flat. I think. Big",

So I'll use a smaller ratio to start for the sake of the example. So we'll do like fifteen. And then I am short. The nine I just rolled these today.

It's a leveraged bullish play. That's what I'm showing you. So here's kind of a breakdown of what you're looking at. You can see the equivalence of the position. Let's say there's no underlying for excess P. It's an index, but you can essentially use spy as a surrogate. So let's say you could buy shares of excess P fifteen lot gives you control over fifty fifteen hundred shares. And right now the well, you could do delta adjusted, but to not bother with that. The total position that it would take up to is eight hundred and two thousand five hundred bucks. The cost to put this position on is just the twenty five point seven times fifteen hundred.

I know that you're stoked on Sierra. I already told you, bro, I'll look at it. But that's not the purpose of the session today. We can look at it Monday. Exhibit patients back to this though on the question about the ratio diagonals. So why do I do it at a ratio? It's very specific. So if we look at an alternate universe where I do a one for one, in this case, it's a little nuance because I was really careful with the delta selection. Yada, yada, yada. So this doesn't have upside risk. But in a lot of standard diagonals. So let's just go in here and actually I think this has like a diagonal, diagonal thing, right? I never use these combined orders. Yeah, there you go. Better diagonal. Great. So this is like a standard diagonal. Notice what that looks like. It is completely completely different, completely different than what you see in the ratio called diagonal. So what happens with a standard diagonal is it's more of a play on volatility.

And you have both upside and downside risk. So the way that I'm trading diagonals is to give me leveraged upside potential that is uncapped, right? So notice how this almost looks like long stock, not quite, but almost. It's uncapped upside profit potential. I collect a bit of a credit with some short options against it. But this is the exact premise of the strategy. It is a leveraged directional play. And I actually have an entire playlist on the ratio diagonal strategies. I have a video coming out soon, specifically on ratio put diagonal strategies because people ask for a little more detail on those, which you know, I'm a man of the people. So that video will be out in the not so distant future. But that's the concept of diagonals. Obviously, I'm happy to dive further into detail.

Jawah says appreciate the streams. How much positive negative effects do weekends have on the Greeks? They have no negative effects. Remember, the Greeks simply are ways to view impacts of options due to different factors. So depending on what Greek you're referring to specifically, we'll have different impacts based on the weekend. One of the most commonly interest one people are interested in is they did a K. Markets are smart. Markets will adjust the pricing of options leading into a weekend so that a lot of the theta decay associated with the weekend actually comes out before the weekend. There's still theta decay over the weekend, but it is not a pure expression. So the weekends will impact things differently because things can move on the weekends, but it's generally a muted impact because unless there's something big that happens, the weekends tend to be pretty quiet.

Tampa says, explain to folks that if they buy a call option and want to exercise for shares and don't have the actual cash, you can have your broker do a cashless exercise without funding capital. You can only do that though if your option is showing enough profit. So yeah, the scenario that Buck is referring to is if you buy an option call specifically. And it shows enough of a profit to cover the cost of taking assignment, which your portfolio would already show that in terms of the net lick that you could take the position, then you can do a cashless exercise.

Would you ever be able to exercise enough options for the gamma of buying shares to cause an offset of the loss of action as a value? They're kind of different things. Yeah, I see your point. The probability of that happening though is very, very low. So yeah, it's an interesting idea, but it's unlikely. A Tampa Bay says, what is your version of one shot one kill on options flow? Gamma Vega long calls. I don't follow your question there. When looking at options flow for me, it's like it's very, very much a position that's built. It's stuff that you kind of build little pieces of the puzzle. It's like filling in a puzzle, I guess is the best way I can describe it. There's not really like a one, a one set thing. It says his position might have tested that 120k near term options. Yeah, that's a great question.

Because here's the other thing. If it's anything other than game stop, typically as you have options that are in the money, getting closer to expiration, the market makers hedging their position. So if you think about something like this, and let's say that you bought options that were 30 delta right here. And at the 85s, the 129, let's say you got them for 129. And they're 32 delta. Let's say then you get a big move in your favor. And now your options look more like these in here that are like 88 delta. The market maker is hedging their position as this is going in the money. They're not just watching it, hoping that it's going to go back out. They're going to have shares, especially as he gets close to expiration to cover this if it's in the money. Now it gets a little bit muddied when we look at the profit incentives for market makers and the way that they think about it. Tampa says this dude is hedging his way not yours. I don't follow.

But for a market maker, their primary profit modality is the bit ask spread. Their goal is to isolate that. So I don't know if your point there, Tampa is the scenarios where you can have market makers that are bending the rules. And that does happen with GME, which is what makes GME special to be very clear. Is what I'm talking about is general approach. The reason why I'm sticking with general approach is compared to talking about anomalous or anomalies in the markets is because you're a bull BSC bow. Well, I want whatever you've had to be honest.

He went through their whole program. And for them, I asked them about Roen Kitty's specifically. And when I looked at the position I asked them, I was like, what would happen here? What would you do? And he was saying that for that option position specifically, the 120,000 long calls, he said that he would be hedged. He would be fully hedged. The other thing he said is that if he thought that it was an informed trader, which we know market makers can do this, they can piggyback off the order flow.

Zack says, I'd in the money call options, if I closed out, it would be at a loss, his premium paid was six, 10. And as of today was 475, generally speaking, better off rolling them, preference is not to exercise. I would just reestablish the position. So if I was in that scenario, there's no reason to necessarily roll them at all.

There's literally 2000 OI. It looks like nothing's happening here. Do you mean like volume in the underlying? Is that what you meant? Even that looks dead. What Joseph, what were you looking at that felt like anomalous to you? It does have bigger call volume. That's for sure. But it's out in 16 August. And it's the 23s.

Anyways, when I look at this, there's really not much that I see going on. All right. Back up here. All right. Being gaming might be a stupid question. We love those. Man, we're always here for some questions. How does Stated to K work for longer length calls versus short term? Yeah. It's a great question. So the, we actually talked a little bit about that earlier. So I don't want to double tap too much. And I also go through this heavily in that video that I posted on buying call smarter. But the Clifnotes version is Thated to K is highest for at the money options and as you get closer to expiration. So Thated to K will expand as you get closer in. Now, there's a little bit of relativity that needs to come into play because you can have options that are further out in time with a moderate size Theta. And then you can compare that to something that zero DTE. And you can say, well, wait a minute, the Theta here is zero. But you said it gets higher as it gets in. Well, the",

So what ends up happening is as a percentage of the remaining premium Theta will be very high as you come in. But again, like you can look at this and you could say, well, wait a minute, this 17 Delta, it only has two Theta. Well, it's because there's just not much extrinsic value left to come out of those. Whereas if we look at, you know, again, a 17 Delta in here, which might still be about a two Theta as a percentage of the remaining premium is much smaller. So yeah, your instinct is correct. It is the punchline. Nice job. Paulus says, here's a trait of thought of placing when Tesla is around 180 short strangle 152 45 nine aug. It would be a precarious position today. How would you go about adjusting it? That's a great question. So first, let's take a look at Tesla and see what, see what the dealio is. Yeah. Okay. And when did you think of this? Earlier this week.

I think that that's nuts. This would be what we would call a terrible, terrible trait. But anyways, in this case, like to succinctly answer this question, I would close the position for a loss. Like you would just be getting murdered. So yeah, this is not what I would trade at all. I have, I had a position on in Tesla that I took off too early because I'm a paper handed pansy. I hate myself. But I ended up catching a really nice move in here, but I was trading it to the upside. So this is not something I would trade a short strangle. If I were to trade a short strangle, the hypothesis would be typically implied volatility trending over realized volatility, which is literally not what has happened since the first at all. If it got blown out, I would have predetermined P and L, P and L targets. So the way I would look at it as let's say that I put the trade on the first because I'm crazy.

The second thing is five delta is way too low in my opinion because you're not collecting enough for the risk that you're taking. You're essentially selling tail risk, which is a tough way to make business. You'll make money most of the time. But when you get caught, it will be murderous. And it will happen every so often, which funny enough, it's kind of happening here. I won't be able to fast forward through the week, right? Because it's just done and they don't have it in here yet.

So you did a 30 delta on this side and a five delta. Did I miss read? No, you said the 150s. You did a four delta. You're a madman. I would love to go to Vegas with you because I can only imagine the kind of bets you'd be placing out there. It would be something, something magical. But in this case, I would model this trade. I would say I stand to make 800 bucks. Here's my risk profile. When does this start to lose too much money relative to what I can make? If I go all the way out to the break evens of the trade, I run a specific risk. And the reason why I run a risk here is because even though this position would be fully profitable here, I technically would potentially lose just 3. If I don't hold to expiration, the unrealized PL, if it moved there in the near term, would be almost 1,600, 1,700. Roy Titty says Tampa needs to be kicked out of here. I really try not to do that. I don't like to do that. You run a risk because people think you are FOS. That's okay. Yeah, that's okay. I think Buck guy is fine. I would just leave them alone. Let them",

I don't like censoring people and I don't like pushing people away unless they're like, egregiously obnoxious or disrespectful. But I think we're getting close, but we're not there yet. So I would avoid, look to avoid it. See if we can get through the next 10 minutes amicably. That would be my hope here. But back over to this, I would say maybe here. Let's say that I stand to make 800. I'm okay if I lose 16,000. Whatever that is. So in this case, that would take me to 253. Then down here, it would take me much lower. Actually, I forgot because the Delta is just so skewed. Okay. Sorry, Buck. That's no bono. So we're going to kill that. And then we're going to do that. So unfortunately, because I forgot, I don't even know who we tried to insult, but I don't deal with that. So sorry, brother, we're not playing that game.

Yeah, in a way, that's the Louis go. That's hilarious. So yeah, back to this, what I would do in this case is just set a range. It would be something like this. It would be to the 253 and then something down here, let's just call to the 134.

It doesn't need to go in the money to make money. Right. So this position, let's replicate it. The 816 you said so here and the 15, which I actually like that by. It's at 80 delta. That's a that's a good trade. And it looks like this trade would have went on semi recently. I actually, I think I've told you guys this already, but I started in a failure relationship with unusual whales because they have like a kind of a slick platform for this kind of stuff that's a little more user friendly than what I do. So there's a discount code in the video description for folks that are interested. But let's take a look. And what is this? The 15? So if we grab the 15 strike. Thor, leave yourself alone. At the old McDonald's, sorry, you guys know what goes. And so I'm looking at essentially the last. Oh, that's not what I meant last month. Oh, interesting.

This is this isn't interesting trade. So what I'm looking at right now is the size of the positions that are going on, which is here. I'm looking at the frequency. So when they went on. So it looks like a lot of these are multi-leg, which I don't feel as strongly about. The trade was to open as determined by the size. Only trades that can be positive identify and marked as such. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's interesting accumulation. For sure. So there's a couple other things now that I would look at. Let me get this out of the way for now. And let's take a look at some other stuff. I get this out of the way. So the open interest is not exciting at all. The open interest indicates a pretty big balance between calls and puts. The interesting position really is this one that went on that we were just talking about those 15s. These are like sad little. This is so funny. So what I'm right now doing is kind of assessing the volatility smile. And these are interesting because the put side is heavy, which I would expect,",

This and this. So these are two two studies you guys should look at. This one is fascinating. What this is highlighting is that there is absolutely an observable abundance of this kind of activity where people that have insider information, you don't have to look any further than Nancy Pelosi for that joking, but not joking. We'll use options. And it's because they're more efficient. So you can see that this is really interesting. That 25 of takeovers have abnormal positive values short dated out of the money calls. That's expectation of big move. Right. So if you know a company you're in has the potential of being taken over, buying out of the money calls is a great move.

All right. See what else you guys got? Crypteto says what would be the most beginner friendly book to start with? The most beginner friendly book to start with would be this one probably options as a strategic investment, I believe. That's why I recommend it to most people. That's why it's kind of the standard go to book. It's because it gives you enough to go off of. It's a decent summary of a lot of high level topics. I like this book a lot.

However, you're going to also experience not like you need a pretty big move here, but you'll move dollar for dollar, which is good. So in that sense, that's all good. I like the 16-og way better. And the reason why I like the 16-og way better, even though it's a little more expensive, a little more extrinsic value, the trade has some time to work. Now, if you tell me that your thesis is something is going to fly off the handle in the next like in the next week and that's part of your hypothesis, then yeah, I think being closer makes sense. I also like that you use the primary explorations. I like that you didn't use any of these weird little half strikes that the weaklies have or anything like that because they're less liquid.

I heard this somewhere that the market tends to drop or month or two before election day. Is that rumors? Or do you try to trade it by placing longer shorter days' aspirations? A great question.

I do have a data set that could tell me so that's something I can follow up on for sure in the discord. I'll take a note on that right now. That's a really easy one. That'll take me like straight up just a couple minutes. But we'll take a look at market behavior. Five days. Two days. And one day. Pre and post election. And we can break that out too by like who's elected and that kind of stuff which is typically useful. So yeah, definitely. I",

The other thing we could do realistically and I bet that there's something on it already is this. Let me take a look quick look. This is our end stock market election year. Yeah. Most of this stuff has been researched to some degree. I am a little bit of a data control freak. I like understanding what I'm using. So I typically look at my own stuff and essentially only my own stuff. But I always will look for what exists already. So here's one right here that we can look through together very quickly. Okay, never mind. This one is from good old Bangladesh which I actually am less interested in. Let's test this one. That's Nigeria. It's good. Maybe we have to do like in the US. Here's another one we can take a look at real quick. Before I abandon ship. What country are you from? They use commas in their decimal points. Let's see. I don't really like this so far what I'm reading. The United States, exact day every even year. Here you go. Positive drift starts as soon as the",

The United States, exact day every even year. Here you go. Positive drift starts as soon as the fifth day before the election ends at the day of election with almost 2.5 performance on average. There you go. And obviously you'd want to do a bunch more research about the quality, the distribution, like those kinds of things. But yeah, there's at least a pre-limancer before I have a chance to look at it myself which I again will do because I prefer to look at my own shit. Beach dreaming says dang I never catch these on time. Thanks for all you're doing great at teaching. That's awesome. I love I literally love teaching. It's teaching. It's funny because like it's not just teaching this stuff. It's teaching anything that I have a skill set in. I really, really value the process of teaching. A big reason behind that I try to give people like the motivations for stuff and like I grew up with a single mom and I knew my dad and I love my dad but it was a weird relationship and it wasn't super healthy. Long story short, the way that I learned how to become like a man and learn things is from a lot of different people. I had people teach",

Long story short, the way that I learned how to become like a man and learn things is from a lot of different people. I had people teach me about cars. I had people teach me about basketball. I had people teach me about cooking steaks. And it's all these different dudes that help teach me a bunch of different things. So I derived a tremendous amount of value from that and I think that's why I'm so passionate about teaching is for that exact reason. Crypteto, thank you so much. I hope you have a killer rest of your evening and weekend and I'll see you during the market prep session on Sunday. Thank you very much, man. Back up the John says I'm fairly new. Would you say there's a certain time of year when stocks perform the best like summers. Uh, yes and no, there are broad answers you could apply to that but the very situation dependent. So there is absolutely a seasonality to a lot of different things that you can observe. But it's there's enough variance in it that it makes sense to learn the variance I would say. Captain says does it make sense to exercise these close to expiration because some sort of movement towards earnings or something I'm unsure typically not if you're talking about your options typically it's",

Captain says does it make sense to exercise these close to expiration because some sort of movement towards earnings or something I'm unsure typically not if you're talking about your options typically it's most logical. Just trade them. Reese says I know what a standard deviation implies but how is that number calculated. So there's a few different ways you can think about. Standard deviation specifically with respect to volatility which is essentially that but it's use it uses the square root. Of the variance from a mean and the reason why you do well it's technically the variance squared then you do the square root of that and that just creates positive integers for everything and then it magnifies it a little bit when you square it and then you square root it to get back to the unilateral base metric. So yeah that's kind of it. One key rep says how come my question's gone I didn't see it if you have one they'll feel free to drop it in I'm about to hop off in a minute because my B does just got here but I am happy to take a look.

Okay let me get through these last two orange says BBB why yeah so the problem with stuff like this is I don't think you can apply standard technical analysis is what it boils down to like products like this are really anomalous their floats behave very differently. And also my charts not loading it so little bit of an uneventful but this doesn't. This typically doesn't follow standard rules is really the way I would boil that down. Alpha says I have a stocks related question should I trade my shares in BDSM of stocks for something more recent. I think you should do whatever you want I'm really I have no opinion or vested interest in what individual traders do with their positions and I don't say that to defer or to not answer your question but it's to force you to answer your own question I think that that's that's why. And it's because like trading is going to be based on your own thought where if you like whatever stock you have and you want to continue holding it do that if whatever stock you have isn't doing what you want it to do anymore then don't hold it get rid of something else.

Prior patterns and stuff like this is because they're so anomalous it's actually very difficult like to screely attribute them to things. So. All right you guys that officially sums me up I think this is the longest one we've done this over two hours but I had a blast with you guys I'm going to go stuff my fat face and then walk my dog but I will see you guys in the discord over the weekend be an outlier I'll see you guys for part six next Friday catch you later.",
