    "text": "starting out i was actually thinking about turning this into a little bit of a mini series kind of you know like a monologue with my younger self because i see a lot of young traders on reddit and in the discord groups i'm a part of and i i just see so much of myself because we most of us are very similar if we're trading there's a lot of similarities in what we're doing and i think that we can seriously stand to learn so much from one another um and kind of enhance the process looking back i have been super fortunate in kind of the risk that i've taken and where i've been able to navigate myself to and if i can impart some of that to folks so that they don't have to take the steps back that i did man like they're you could be super successful really early if you still benefit from the education side of things without having to pay for it so that's really my goal with this you know self monologue thing but anyways as always let me know if there's anything that you want to see me talk about in particular happy to do it and i will catch everybody later",
