    "text": "hey everyone eric here with part three of the small stack segment and this one i want to outline my strategies kind of what i'm looking to employ here so nothing new it's going to be cash secured puts to covered calls to cache secured strangles diagonals and maybe some verticals so let's walk through what i'm looking at the cast secured put covered call coverage strangle i bucket those all together because they're very defined this is going to be essentially my staple strategy for the put side i'm going to be looking at 0.2 to 0.3 deltas and it's because i want to balance probability of being assigned i want to avoid assignment but i also don't want to roll that much so to work around that that's why i'm looking at 0.2.3 deltas i would like to add to this make sure that i'm getting at least one percent return on invested capital and once i am assigned for the covered calls i i'm gonna make sure that the short strike is above my basis period so if there's a point where i can't sell calls above my basis i'm just gonna hold unless it hits my downside management which is going to be anything greater than a 10 drop would be a candidate to sell i will take a look at it if i still have strong convictions then i will likely hold on to the product longer term but once i hit 10 percent draw",
