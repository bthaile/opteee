    "text": "Do you want to be right or do you want to make money? I asked myself that frequently because as a trader, you don't need to know everything. So the understanding every single interdependency and relationship actually takes a ton of effort and it's not a great return on your capital or your time. You can be curious about things, no problem, but always focus first on making money and then if you have a passion interest in the markets and economics, sure, go ahead and learn about it. But differentiate the two, because you don't need to know that one tag headline that the news media attempts to bubble everything up to every day in a convenient narrative in order to make money, it's just noise, being not a LSEL leader.",

I started trading in 2007 and have spent over 30,000 hours honing my skillset. I\u2019ve no secret tricks or \"easy money\" strategies. However, I carefully studied, created strategies, tracked results, and optimized my performance. I became a multi-millionaire before 32 as a result. I actively trade derivatives and invest in residential and commercial real estate as well as startups. My goal is to share quality information without the BS.\n\nThe Outlier Community is built to connect you with other driven people who are pursuing or have achieved financial outlier status.
