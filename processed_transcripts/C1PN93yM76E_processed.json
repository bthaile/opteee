You can be curious about things, no problem, but always focus first on making money and then if you have a passion interest in the markets and economics, sure, go ahead and learn about it. But differentiate the two, because you don't need to know that one tag headline that the news media attempts to bubble everything up to every day in a convenient narrative in order to make money, it's just noise, being not a LSEL leader.",
