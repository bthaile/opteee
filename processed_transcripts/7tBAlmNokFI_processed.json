Unfortunately, Newton was busy today, which I mean, the man as a family is stuff to do, I totally understand. But he and I were going to connect back up next weekend. So for this session today, what I wanted to do is use it as a little bit more of a learning session for me. And hopefully to understand more of what you guys are looking at, how you're receiving and thinking about the information. And then obviously if there's questions that you guys have, one, I would do my best, especially if it's options related and stuff, yeah, I can handle that, no problem. But if there's questions that you guys have or ideas that I don't know about, I'm going to keep it a buck with you and I'll tell you I have no idea. And then, but what I can do is keep those in my back pocket for when we have this session with Newton next weekend, because he and I, we, we text most days a little bit here and there at least. So I can always run some of the stuff by him as well and ask him to cover some of the questions and want his videos. He's awesome, right? So I just wanted to be super, super clear that I have a",

So I just wanted to be super, super clear that I have a very limited knowledge about the subject, the goal for today is to learn more about it. And also to hang out with you guys, I find the more I hang around the ape community, the really that the happy RIM, I think overall, I have to be honest, I've been in markets for a while and I've already mentioned this before, but it's not super, it's not super frequent where I come across elements of markets that are like generally foreign to me. And this is that in a lot of ways. A lot of the things that you all are looking at are highly, highly unique to the ape community, to the game stock community, which is very cool to me because I've said this before. If you look at other kinds of market participants and you ask them like, Hey, explain to me what a FTD is or explain to me the concept of an ETF creation and redemption cycle. Like they won't know that. Most people don't know that stuff. And that's been one of the cool things from my perspective is I'm getting an opportunity to learn more about that stuff with you guys.

So I would ask that if there are like specific resources, specific Reddit posts, anything like that that you think is useful for us to take a look at or for me just to help me understand more about the story. I would love it. And please throw that in the chat. So the first thing I want to start with though is just taking a closer look at the Andrew left case and Citroen research. Then I want to take a look specifically at there is a video brought up to me by Rowan Kitty about like a spreadsheet that he uses like his tools. I think it was in this. Yeah. So they mentioned that he has like this really intricate series of tools that he uses. So I want to take a look at that.

So if I'm trying to finish a puzzle, I can get a couple pieces from this, one a couple pieces from this, one a couple pieces from this one. And that's literally just because not only is the system highly complicated, which I think we've talked about, but there's an even bigger reason than that. And it stems a lot from the fact that we're dealing with a system where people don't follow the rules. And again, like we can clearly see that. And the reason why that matters is because that's happening, how can you solve a problem set like that with standard analysis per se? And you know that you're kind of playing a game where the other counterparties aren't really following the rules. So it makes it really complex, I think. So the short synopsis of that specifically your question, Zach, I think a lot of it is very believable. I think almost every piece of DD on there has tons of great data and believable components to it, no doubt. Do I think that they are fully comprehensive and fully depict what we're looking at? No, I don't. And more over than that, and I talk to Newton about this actually, because there's another thing I think is going on, which is who doesn't want",

And more over than that, and I talk to Newton about this actually, because there's another thing I think is going on, which is who doesn't want to be the one to get it right. Because I think that that incentivizes people on places like Superstong or GameStop. And that's actually another question I have for you guys. I'm trying to understand more about the differentiation between these communities. Because I actually don't fully grasp that. And again, I'm coming at this from an outsider perspective. I'm trying to learn. So if I say anything in the process of this that is offensive or sounds ignorant, it is because I'm highly ignorant on the topic. But I don't actually understand this. Like why are these two different places not like joined? Because everything that I can see from Superstong seems to be about GameStop. And I see that that's in the description here. And I think Newton explained a little bit about the breakoff between Superstong from Walls Street bats. So that part I get to a degree, I think. But this one I don't fully understand. And the other thing is I don't actually know who came first. I guess is there a way for me to see that here? So Ruta Biggest says divergencies.

Eric says usually people ban from Superstong head over to GME. Okay, got it. That's helpful. So and then Gravitt Terris says I've noticed Superstong is a bit more hardcore. Interesting. I also wouldn't have guessed that. So that's really helpful context for me. So I appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah, I was just trying to understand how these two communities operated in conjunction with one another because they both have really interesting data sets. What I like to do in here when I'm trying to learn more about this stuff is I just go on to the top posts of all time and see what we have. So this is, that's interesting. And this is another interesting component that I find is that like there is just a universal hate towards this homey, which makes sense to be clear that that also doesn't surprise me at all. Zach says there's also one called DFV. I've seen the DFV one. That one looks to be a little bit different in tone, at least as far as I could tell.

Like literally this, the top handful of posts are from the homey DFV and then we just immediately go to essentially hating this dude, which is awesome. I love that. And that's another thing that I was talking to about with Newton is I think it's awesome that there's just this very distinct common enemy. I always love me a good common enemy. It's the greatest when people with all different backgrounds can unite and just hate one person or one thing that objectively probably is not super great. It's awesome. Big fan. So yeah, this is one of the things I was noticing. All right. So back up to Zach, I think that was as much of the question as at least as far as I can think of right now. Jonathan says, have you seen a single deep dive pan out? That was actually a question I was going to have for you guys because I personally have not.

And what that means is if you're trying to do that, it becomes like how many darts can you throw out the dart board and how many of them will stick, right? And I made a comment about that in the GME video I did yesterday where people are incentivized to guess a lot because I can tell you what will happen is as soon as one person guesses a meaningful portion of this correct, that's all that they will care about. And the preceding track record of, you know, X number of missed guesses doesn't matter anymore. And I'm not saying whether it should or shouldn't, but it's just how kind of the human brain works with stuff like this, which I can't help but find kind of kind of interesting. I'm just catching up on the chat to see if there's anything else. Mike says, hi, what up, Mike, it's you. All right, let me get back up here. MoneyTing says Ken Griffin is a fraud.

So one of the things I notice about, well, first let me, actually we can do that. So there's two things I want to share with you guys. If you guys haven't seen it, there's a video that I was going to share. This one is, it's kind of long, but it's a, it's a really, really good video that I think is worth your time, which is this one. This one is about FTDs. If you guys haven't seen this, I assume pretty much, I'm probably the last person on Earth to have come across this with you guys. But if, if that's not the case, I think you guys should take a look at this because this dude does just an absolutely fantastic job of describing this process of FTDs, naked short selling and stuff like that. If you guys want to go through this in a little bit, I am very, very happy to do that. So let's focus on a couple starting points here. I guess one of the things that I wanted to do was actually start with one of these older, roaring kitty videos because this was shot",

    "text": "go through this in a little bit, I am very, very happy to do that. So let's focus on a couple starting points here. I guess one of the things that I wanted to do was actually start with one of these older, roaring kitty videos because this was shot in quite a bit earlier. And I think, so I was going through his old videos. And one of the things that I find fantastic and super disenfranchising at the same time is that he has 85 videos and like a million subscribers, which is, I mean, it's a joke, it's awesome. The dude is awesome. And he should have every single one of those. Well, I'm not subscribed. We just got to turn that off. Anyways, we, I love this. And one of the funny things is when I look at this stuff, it's like, I was looking at the views and I can see this stuff that you guys cared a lot about. And then the things that didn't really hit the Richter scale, which I also found that pretty interesting. I wanted to ask about some of this. But anyways, this is the video I wanted to start with. So I'm going to, I'm only going to show you, I'm going to pause this. I'm going to make sure that you guys can hear it through here. A quick admin note, YouTube sometimes can be really weird about copyright infringement, which I don't care. Like if that",

But anyways, all that is to say that the, that I think YouTube looks at this stuff really carefully. So if the stream cuts, I essentially just have to turn this off and then they'll turn the stream back on. I've had that happen with during the Apple Vision Pro thing, I was looking at it. And essentially that happened. So if we cut out for a second, that's what's going on, just a quick heads up. But I want to watch through some of this. For you guys, if there's specific pieces in here or elements of this that you want us to focus on, let me know.

And when I look at this, I can see how that starts. But then he talked about some of this stuff in here about his movement from value investing, which I thought was super interesting. So I typically listen to things at two times speed. I think that that might be a little too fast for some people for the uninitiated. It might sound just like gibberish. So maybe I'll do like one and a half and see how you guys feel about one and a half. Because obviously it's a two hour video. We're not going to get through the whole thing. I want to kind of find through a couple of different spots. Are you the main ones? Okay. So the three, let's see if I can show each one quickly without diving into each one.

It's actually kind of similar to what I do, but it's a different approach. But he has kind of individual data components. It seems that he's aggregating up to a very specific view that he wants to co-late and have data in one spot. Super efficient makes it ton of sense. So that's why you're always going to have a few on the universe. It's only taking a latest version. It's going to be good to get yours.

Okay, so let's go to the submit tab. The submit tab is where I'll submit to the database. So let's say so when I first of all, anything below this black line, right?

Although, as I just get this really fun random pain that starts shooting around, it's kind of like a fun game. I like to see where it goes and how debilitating it is. Which is moderately so.

Like people that end up generally herniating discs are if they're not in good shape and they actually don't bend over their back and stuff and they become too rigid.

So the fact that my boy is decked out in this white kit is inspiring to me. Another type of spreadsheet that is like six or seven of them, in fact I found a report time, like a one, two, three, four, five, six of these types of spreadsheets where I analyze fundamentals, okay? And that's what this spreadsheet is. And I'll show you this one, this is where I'm analyzing the business and historical profitability and trying to realize everything to inform me. I don't have estimate values. I could do that where it might be. I put together some formulas and forecasts where the value could be. I sell them for you. It doesn't matter. And then there's the universal spreadsheet. In the universe spreadsheet, a little bit less exciting. It's kind of like maintenance stuff. And I submitted it to my DB and I take notes on it.

And I thought that that was really interesting for two reasons. One, with his background, and I honestly, I don't know how old he is at this point is four years ago. He looks super young, but I also just aged terribly. So that he might be the same ages as me. I have no idea. But the, I don't know how old he is and I don't know how long he's been in markets, but I know that he's savvy. Even at this point, this four years end point, and I can tell by a lot of what he's doing, obviously. The reason why I say that is because it surprises me to hear the evolution in his thoughts of value investing, essentially between this timeframe. I mean, I just took that as somewhat noteworthy. I thought it was interesting. Coffee Donut says, is it a service connected injury? It's a great question. I, he's talking about my back.

Because I think it recently changed. So let's take a look at XRT holdings. Because let me see. I have to download all the holdings. That's what I'm grabbing right now for you guys. Cool. And then I'm just opening up the excel sheet. Cool. All right. So this is as of 25 July. So let's see what's in this bad boy. First let's check out what GME holding it has. How much? So right now it's holding. I assume this is shares. Yeah, okay. The 164,000 shares. So it's just really not that much. So in this case, big A saying should have pulled guard. That is like the most offensive thing I've ever heard in my life. Oh God. And you know that too. You know that that's going to piss me off. I can't even deal with that.

I can't even deal with that. Now it wouldn't surprise me though if we see Craig Jones pull guard with Gabi Garcia. I think that would be hilarious. But anyways, so this is holding a relatively small amount of GameStop. So it's like 1.12 of the ETF. It's I'm using this as like a line for you guys so you could see. And then the other question is is Siri in here and Siri is not in here. I didn't think so. So no, Siri obviously would be in other ETFs. But oh shit, Siri is now listening to me. That's sketchy bro. My phone literally started listening in. Obviously it's already already listening. But yeah, okay, so I don't see that here. Fun fact. Adam says IWB, we can take a look. Holdings. Detailed holdings. IWB. It's funny. I literally have all these downloaded already, but I don't know where they are. All right, let's see. Jimmy. Damn it. Back up to the top. I hate that. So I'm just expanding all these so that I can see like what it actually is. Wait, actually, I guess we literally could just filter by up here. That would be kind of nice because this way we can see both of them side by side. So let's",

All right, so let's go back in here and let's grab just Jimmy this time for real. And then let's grab C of series in here. It is. So, okay, now I'm confused. How is this the case? So this is telling me that it's zero weight, notional values. How is it zero weight? Does it just miss and does most here? It'll me that Batman. How does that make sense? I mean, I get that it would be so small, right? So right now I'm looking at the holdings on this here. And obviously it shows the weight, but it just doesn't make sense because the weight on this is 0.01. There should be a third or fourth decimal, right? Because the market value here is 2.4 versus 1.6. That's not that far apart. So they should have a third decimal or fourth decimal if they need, but they just cut it at 2. So the cliff notes of that is they're both in here for sure, but this is obviously so, so, so, so light weighted that they didn't",

I wish they did. And GameStop is also very, very small. GameStop is 0.01. So Scott Copeland says I guess it's weighted as a 0, 0, x, yeah, but like I thought they would at least, because when I downloaded it from the website, it says that this is like the detailed holdings, right? So like where's the fucking detail? I would like to be able to see the, I'd like to be able to see it. Ryan O'Ducks says 0.00 is tiny. Yeah, definitely. Well, it's okay, that's actually incorrect. So it's, that means it's tiny as it relates to the underlying. But when you're talking about products like this, I'm just differentiating, right? Like I don't think you should draw the conclusion that linearly, although I think in this case, it's not wrong. So in this case, though, because like for example, let me just give you a null. The null example here is what if the, the ETF that it's in is massive, absolutely massive. You can have something that's weighted really lightly, but still represent a large gross position.",

This is like they need to combine it. So we need to edit this and it needs to be an inspired combined. Ryan O'Ducks. Except maybe I need to spell combined right. That might help. Well, that's a yo-grino. All right. Let's see. I didn't spell right. That was my fault. Let's see. League says, can you advise on my fantasy football team? I know jack shit. Whoa. Fantasy football.

Now back to this ETF thing. There's a reality behind this ETF redemption and creation cycle. So this is something that Newton has been starting to track more and more and more. If you guys don't know, Newton has this absolutely crazy, crazy GME sheet where he's tracking essentially everything. So I mean, I imagine all of you are familiar with this, but if you're not, it's literally accessible to everybody. And there's just a ton of great resources in here. It takes a while to even figure out how to read it to be completely honest with you, but it's worth, it's definitely worth your time if you're following this at all.

Now again, this is a thing that he and I actually look at together quite often. And one of the things that I notice people do is they, they focus too much on positive identification and not enough on total correlation analysis. So what I've been doing is downloading the sheet so that I can run in a broader data set. And I'm looking at things like FTDs, I'm looking at redemption cycles. And I'm trying to understand like the actual correlations. It's important in my opinion to be as objectively is humanly, is objective is humanly possible. So what I mean by that is like some of the issues I see are like, there are a lot of instances where there's like these weird off cycle movements, meaning we might think that there's a tailwind of some sort or there might be some sort of crazy pop in ETF volume or something. But then it doesn't translate to anything. So sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. And that's one of the really the anomalies that continues to go in with this. So we take a look, we, and I again, when I say we, it's I am nothing in this story. It's almost all Newton.

Ukraine says back to the topic, bro, what topic is this not, we're talking about GameStop. Ukraine, what should we be talking about? But so he's starting to build out this here. So we're trying to get a sense for all of these different ETFs and the FTD cycles. This is creation and redemption over here. So when I look at creation and redemption, this is another relatively new piece of the puzzle. Again, Newton has a lot, a lot of detail on this as is. But there does seem to be some interesting correlations here. But again, the issue that we have is that there are a lot of non flag events as well that happened. So I want to be, yeah, I want to be really clear about that because as I'm analyzing these larger data sets, there's instances where you see like massive, massive creation and redemption. But the other problem behind this is there's, it's not just limited to GameStop, right?

I think just out of curiosity. But I also don't think, yeah, I don't necessarily, I think there's a lot of noise is the way I should say that. Let me see. Markets says, can you talk about the upcoming 16-OGGME options who are back holding? Yeah, definitely. I can absolutely do that. That is, I'm way, way more well versed in that. Before we take a look at that though, Marquette, really quick. I just wanted to share a few studies with you guys. This one is really cool. So let me throw this in here. So these are all different papers. I shared a ton with Newton to include on like short squeezes, gamma squeezes. This is how I analyze information is I'm looking for broad objective data sets that I can then integrate into my own data set and try to learn. If you don't like reading white papers, this will be terribly annoying for you. I recommend just dropping it into chat GPT. But when you do that stuff with chat GPT, always ask it for what are the limitations of this research. Don't just say, what are the takeaways?",

But when you do that stuff with chat GPT, always ask it for what are the limitations of this research. Don't just say, what are the takeaways? Because if you just get the takeaways and you don't understand the limitations of the research, you're getting a highly skewed picture that I don't think is the best use of your time and effort. So yeah, anyways, I wanted to share those with you guys before we moved on. Okay, so now following up with Marquette asking about 16 all GME options. Yes, we can do that. I guess maybe we could start with just a quick broad overview. I'll do a lot of this in the in kind of like my standard video update tomorrow. So we don't have to go super far in depth. Also this is a Arnold Palmer. Absolutely fantastic, big fan. But right now, right now as I look at the stock, it's behaving strangely to me is what I think. And the reason why I say that is because the way that I'm noticing the volume coming through and the percentage of sale to buy volume and the price behavior of the underlying is very weird. So what I mean by that is let me get my ugly face out of your way so that you can see the volume down here clearly.",

So what I mean by that is let me get my ugly face out of your way so that you can see the volume down here clearly. And a few things stick out to me. One of them is notice all of the sale volume over the last, essentially from the 17th of July. We did have one slightly favorable day on the 22nd and then one more on the 23rd. But other than that, mostly sale volume. So sale volume on the 18th on the 19th, it was almost all sale volume, the overwhelming majority of volume that we saw that day literally was sale volume. And then we see on the 24th, majority sale volume yet again, and then also here on the 26th. So the reason why I think that's weird is because price isn't necessarily cratering as much as I would expect it to given that amount of sale volume. Now the total average volume is also being siphoned out heavily. And there's somebody sent me a theory that I think we should take a look at in a few minutes that I actually think is really, really important because they're starting at least out some of the things that I was told or I haven't looked at it yet.

But some of the things that I think are in there will be slightly informative as we look at this. Punchline I see on a chart highly, highly range bound. And we are not necessarily, we're not making great headway here. I think we're at a bit of an inflection point here. And the reason why I think we're at a bit of an inflection point is because we're seeing a series of higher lows. And thankfully we pivoted here. Otherwise we would have broke down into a downtrend like a fully confirmed downtrend. But this isn't too, this doesn't look great still. And it's because we have the lower low here, higher lows, higher lows, we kind of hit a term high here. And it came back down. It essentially started testing previous lower lows. And it's still hovering down here. So what I'm highlighting is just in standard technical analysis, typically when something is in an uptrend, you'll see both higher highs and higher lows. You're going to expect to see lows, that's normal, but they're typically higher if something is in an uptrend. This is starting to look to me something that's in very much a sideways trend. Like we are just grinding sideways here. So I think in this",

So I think in this case, the price behavior is strange is really the summary of that. Now if we take a look at the options, there's a bunch that sticks out to me. The first thing, I mean, just take a look at the OI after expiration. After expiration on Friday, we lost a ton of options as you would expect. But the call OI right now is 569, gigity. And the put OI is at 347. So from like an OI skew perspective, I don't actually love this. And the reason why I don't love this is because in my opinion, this is something that is very, very much starting now to trend sideways. And the options are also, they're backing that idea, which I don't love here. The reason why I say that is because I'm just, I'm not seeing the massive option skew that we typically see when GME is really poised to start moving higher. So when I see these almost at a one to one, that is fairly anomalous to what this looks. And I mean, let's take the time, right? Like we're in a livestream. Let's take a look at it together.

I don't know if I would make those comparisons personally. I could see why somebody might do that, but I don't think it actually makes a lot of sense. We can talk about it, but I wouldn't personally make that comparison. But this is what I wanted to show you guys. When GME stopped starting to get like really poised to move higher, take a look at the disposition and the options before the move started. So this is still when it was down grinding lower. It created this short term base at about 10. And then it was grinding a little bit higher, but it hasn't even made that breakout move yet to the upside. The initial leg up. It hasn't made that yet. And if you take a look at the options, there's 414,000 calls to 106,000 puts.",

And if you take a look at the options, there's 414,000 calls to 106,000 puts. So it's literally almost four times calls to puts. And this is before that move. This is why options are so informative. You can see a lot of information and options. It's how I caught this most recent move. It's how I traded the squeeze back in 2021 is through identifying stuff like this. So anyways, what I'm highlighting to you is before the move even started. And even if you include roaring kiddie's position in here, which was 120,000, right? Take those 120,000 out of this. It's still three times calls to puts. So massive, massive calls to you when this thing started wanting to make some pretty, pretty meaningful movements up. When I look at it now, right, there's a, there's much denser options, but there are also much more balanced. It's not even two to one at this point calls to puts. It's contracted quite a lot. So now looking out at the expiration cycle of choice, which is 16 aug. And the reason why I think it's important to look out at 16 aug because two aug is really quiet. Nine aug is even more quiet still. 16 aug is the first chance we get a",

Nine aug is even more quiet still. 16 aug is the first chance we get a look at something that even offers something active. And I say this a lot to remind people because the monthly explorations are almost always going to be busier than the other explorations available to us. And it's specifically from a liquidity perspective. This is very, very common behavior. This is not anomalous in any stretch of the imagination. So I think it's just important to know that this is overall, I would consider it like generally standard fare, essentially. It has very lime, spin drift, big fan. I got to stop drinking on the onal Palmer because it's black tea. It's got caffeine and we're coming up on 6 p.m. We're not about to be, we're not about that life. So when I look at 16 aug, I see a few things. I see the very standard, massive, massive build out of options here at the 125. And I continue to see this every single cycle. This is actually something that I try and trade myself, not the 125s, but the mispricing of the 125s and the rush of volume.

These look like the 40s. Yep. These look like 25s. Yes, these look like 20s. Yes. These look like 50s. What I'm highlighting is that this is standard human behavior where we pick the round numbers. Right. So there's a 15 to 16 to 17 and 18 19, 20, 20. So yeah, I can count, believe it or not. I got to check. Do you see that? You see that shit counted right there? No problem. Can do it. And so when I look at this though, I can still see that that's where most people are really centralizing their options. My ham says 125 can't be retail. They did the mistake once, twice, three times. What else could it be? Oh no, I definitely think it's largely retail. Yeah. I wouldn't say that it's all retail.

So it just in order to build any sort of size that they would want. So yeah, I don't really think, yeah, I don't really think it's not retail. I think it's a mix of retail and institutions for sure. But I would 100 argue back that it can be retail. There's probably a lot of them in there actually is based on the purchasing behaviors that I see, which we can actually validate a little bit.

And I don't want to go into this whole fucking story of my background. But like unequivocally has changed my life. I grew up poor. And now because of trading, I'm at a completely different echelon in my life. I literally retired my mom because I figured out how to do this shit. And it's a really powerful skill set once it's understood. The problem is so many instances people start trading like myself with really terrible terrible understanding of what they're getting into and expectations. And then it leads to people just losing tons of money unnecessarily. So one of my big objectives there is to try to put stuff out to slow people down from doing that. Like that's there's a video that I have here and I'll I'll share it in here. Literally every single time I have an opportunity to share this video, I do.

And that's literally exactly what it's called. It's a 16 minute video about this exact thing. So that video goes into structuring trades at least what I would consider to be smarter. So that it's not necessarily just lighting money on fire continually. But anyways, back to this. So we're going to get rid of the bids. We're going to look at the 125s specifically so we can kill the puts. And then we need to look specifically for people that are gaining exposure in 18 or I'm sorry, 16 and then let's do strike price minimum 125, which is also the maximum. So we don't have to put into. So let's see. So for the past week, there's and again, this is limiting by size, right? This is not tracking all of the transactions. This is looking at the larger transactions. That's what these platforms do. I have another platform. Well, really, it's a data source opera that I can pull all of the data for if we wanted. But really, I just want to highlight the fact that a lot of these positions in general are being entered in much smaller size. Right? So like the total premium for this trade is a thousand bucks.

So more often than not, there's again, like this isn't probably an institution building some sort of position. They would have to do a lot of this. And you can look the way it's deconflicted by time. That's probably not the case. Like these look like smaller traders or it could be, you know, smaller institutions. It's not all institutions are huge. But still, the idea there that I'm just trying to highlight for you guys is that it absolutely looks like there's a mix of activity going on there. I think that's kind of the general synopsis on that. Let me see. I'd rather be seeing saying, I'd rather be skiing is saying, yep, I'm trying to learn proper options so I can stop doing straight equity all the time. Yeah. What I think about trading is options are a tool and they have their place. They're not inherently better than a bunch of other tools, but they do afford a lot of opportunities that are not afforded by things like equity. So that is a reality behind these products.

So what, what, like, what is the link you guys see? Maybe we can start there. So Adam, could you outline for me the way that you see, like the correlation? Because here's one of the things to be aware of. If you're looking at just the way that price performs. But yeah, I mean, let's just take a look.

Three day correlation, 60 five day correlation, negative 5, 10 day correlation, 53 30 day correlation, 3 like this is not a product that's correlated, at least in terms of price behavior.

But like as I look at this and try to identify that pattern you're seeing, it's just not here. Now I want to be again, also very clear. It doesn't mean that there's no, no overlap. Of course there's overlap. They operate in similar communities to one another. But beyond that, I just don't, I just don't see the broader correlation that you're seeing here. Yeah, even down from like a volume perspective, I don't see it. There's some overlap zero doubt 100 agree with that point. But they do not like going back to the original point.

That is an objective fallacy. They are correlated in different instances in different degrees, but not the same. Rudabegas says why would two completely different stocks correlate? Well, a bunch of different reasons, like they're, they can be part of some of the same ETFs. They can be part of similar industries. So I don't know much about costs. So I mean, let's take a quick look and specifically just take a look at what industry and like what they do. Consumer discretionary for costs. So there's your first overlap just from a very high perspective. They're both in consumer discretionary, straight from the jump. So one of the questions Rudabegas, who's why would they correlate a bunch of different reasons, stocks can correlate if they're in similar industries, even if they're not having similar experiences. So you'll see this in the financial sectors all the time and you'll see this across the airlines all the time. You'll find things that operate in similar industries like this that move generally similarly to other things. So Max says, cost makes headphones and audio gear. They are not the same, but there are several instances where costs had jumps right before GME moved. Yeah, I could see why people will say that and I'm not saying it didn't",

The reason why I have that exasperated response is because I think in issue, like again, like let's let's look at it. I wear in this chart over the last six months that cost moved before GME. I see some of the similar price movements on the same days, but I don't actually see where costs moved before GME. Kate, Kate Kresher says we're new today. Today was Newton's union break. He's off today, but he will be back with us next week. And then, yeah, because we definitely need the Oracle here with all the back of the scribe, I should say. The GME scribe that's got all this information down pat. But yeah, like I don't even see the reference there to be completely honest. I see like the third cost went up, but so did GME. I see costs went up ever so slightly here on the 23rd, but so did GME. So that's kind of the problem, right?

If I were to deduce what I think is going on in terms of the general correlation, I would see two things. I would see the first thing is they literally are in the same sector, right? They're both consumer discretionary. That in and of itself will lead them to behave slightly similarly. After that, they, if depending on how much overlap for those ETFs, I absolutely could see the redemption and creation cycle impacting this and the FTD cycle impacting this through the ETFs.

So first, let's dissect this idea of the same algo, quote unquote. And I don't think that that's accurate because that's not even how the algorithms for high frequency traders in high frequency trading firms work. Would they be looked at and traded against one another in different baskets and stuff by different algorithms? Of course, absolutely. And I would expect them to be. But like again, if I look across this over the last six months and I compare this to the GME chart for the past six months, they're different. They are different things. That's what I see. Does that mean that they have no overlap or no correlation? Of course not. They still seem to have that. But it's they're different. And like I can see that they're different.

    "text": "what's the avid? Again, I think that's one of the problems that plagues the community is that people just say stuff. And maybe this person has great due diligence. I just haven't seen it. So first, from your perspective, running DGen, what's the theory? What's the thesis behind it? And why what makes you believe that? Because I don't necessarily, like from what you say there, it essentially doesn't mean anything to me. If you have a post about anything that they've talked about or like their ideas, happy to look at it. But based on that comment alone, I can't really do anything with it because it doesn't have any data for me to look at. Speaking of DD though, this one's interesting. So this one got sent over to me. And I think this one is interesting because it apparently looks to speculate on the relationship between GME and Chewie, which you can help find it interesting, right? Because there is a reality here where Rory and Kitty, who to be very clear, is not a cat as indicated by this tick box here, very important for everybody to understand not a cat, has 9 million or access to 9 million 1000 shares. So that's actually one of the first things we need to analyze here is when filing a 13 D, do options count. And then as always, I prefer to go to the horse's mouth. Should shares that an issue were repurchased to fund a stock",

Then a 13 D or G sells a security short does the beneficial ownership change. The same analysis applies to the pledge of an or the writing of call options. So what I want to what I'm trying to like, discreetly identify because I thought the answer was yes, but I want to actually get to the bottom of it is do options? Are they part of this? Both says checkout James Rowland. But if, Bo, if you have something from James that we should look at, put it in here. I don't, I don't go chasing like individual ideas because there's so many of them. But if you guys have access or if you guys have come across some that again, like look like they have good due diligence, let's take a look at it. Like that's the whole point of these sessions. But if the due diligence is, you know, quote unquote, the melt up with a rocket ship, that's, that's not due diligence to me. That's just a hope, which I do hope that it works out for whoever wants that to happen. But that's personally not what I go",

That's just a hope, which I do hope that it works out for whoever wants that to happen. But that's personally not what I go off of or anything that I would consider to be like efficacious or like usable information for me. But back to this, I really am curious because so let me take a step back and let me explain to you why I care about this. So the reason why this matters is because if you can do this with options, you do not need anywhere near the same amount of money that you need if it is not options. So for example, it looks like the purchase happened on June 24. So if we go to Chewy and we look at 24 June, which lines up, right, there's a ton of buy volume. And let's say on 24 June, let's give them even an advantageous price. Let's say it's like towards the bottom. Let's say it gets in at like 25.5. These other trades do tend to seem to be like towards the morning. So I imagine it would be close. So let's call it like 2529 or 2538, 25.3. I literally just typed in 25.6 as I said, 25.3 because I'm an idiot. So 9 million 1000 shares. He needs 227 million, 725,300. So what I'm going to do",

Let's literally look at this on that day. Let's go to 24 June in Chewie and we'll go back in time. Welcome to the time machine. June 24 Monday. Let's see. So what I can tell you is that it didn't happen very first thing on the open at least as of yet because I do not see any meaningful volume coming in. Although it is starting to drift up indicating to me some level of some level of buying and then just so you know right now it's pre-buffering. That's why we're just chilling. James says, oh, that's funny. James Barrett says James Rowland is saying stuff about weekly and monthly triggers. I don't know what that means, but it would be interested. Yeah.

I advise RK to come back YouTube weekly or perhaps we're a suit. That's funny. Let me see. I'm just curious if I can get this to work. Like I'm actually kind of fascinated right now. If not, we can use current options. It's not a big deal. It just won't be quite as accurate as I would like it to be. What's happening here? Let me try another ticker. Let's try like Apple. We'll let that run for a second. Anyways, back to this in the general hypothesis. The reason why I care about this is because if you can use options when filling in a 13G, so does a 13G apply to options. The reason why this matters is because if you can use options, you can put this position on much more cheaply than before. So this says yes. This is from this, whatever this is. This says 13G of Securities Act 1934 applies to cash settled options that use, okay, so that's actually helpful because this says cash settled options, which is not these. This includes derivatives that are not offered sold, originated with the issuer. It's a 6 to form to include the description, so it would have to be in here. It would have to be in item 6, where's item",

But yeah, anyways, this looks like, this looks like shares to me based on that, based on that quick cursory overview. The reason why that matters is because in order for that to have happened, again, going back to that comment, I left up above for a reference, he needs 227,725,300. What we do know is that he doesn't have that much money in the account as of 13 June, meaning to be able to do both positions at once. Now there's some people speculating, and Newton and I, we went through an exercise, this is just not working up here. We went through an exercise where we analyzed, one of his ideas was, could he have traded enough options with the residual cash here, the 6.3 million, to essentially get another 200 million in the time frame from this update, which was the 13th of June until the trade was reported in July. And again, I'm very against speaking definitively about things that may or may not be true, but what I can say is the probability that he turned that 6 million into the requisite 227 million while completely maintaining this",

So then it goes back to the idea of begging the question of where does that 227 million come from. So I don't know. I really don't know. The simplest answer in my opinion aligns actually with what this, I think this person is talking about, we have to go through this really quick because somebody was talking about this post they sent it to me and I wanted to look through.

It's possible that he has a lot of cash sitting in that account, but it's just pure speculation. Yeah, and I think it's okay to guess, right? But the way I look at it at least is I just go off of what he's saying. And could there be something else? Sure. Actually, let's see. Yeah, so I see because here's my guess with fidelity. My guess is that his prior employment is through there. My guess is that's like a retirement account because he used to work at a financial institution and I'm sure that he probably got a 401k through them. So my guess is that's probably a retirement account. If I had to guess, that's a pretty standard provider for those, especially for financial companies and stuff. So yeah. Anyways, again, a matchin to your point, you could be completely cracked. There could be another account and he goes in there and checks it out or it could be a bunch of cash could be absolutely could be. It also, again, in my opinion, could be just a retirement account. That's my guess. But we have no idea. Could be either or. Banana says retirement account. LOL, but yeah, could be.

I played not this move, but this end into this. And then I played from this down to this. I played from this down. I played this up. I played this down. I actually got stopped out on this one. And then this is for like options plays. I've had long shares in GameStop for a while now. I just kind of hold them. But the options plays are completely different. Like the options plays are really designed to take advantage of momentum and movement. So every time that I see these larger moves, I'm playing them.

So I think, yeah, I mean, that's the general idea is I'm trying to capture the most movement that I can. And specifically with options, the movement that's one of the cool parts about options is I get to trade movement to two different directions up and down and sideways. So like right now, the positions I'm using are I have long shares. I don't have any long options anymore. I'm completely out of them. But I have short options against some of my shares, meaning sold calls against some of the shares. And it's literally to just make it easier to hold those shares as the underlying is trending sideways. But I already started phasing out of my long share position as well. I paired it down quite a lot because of these two moves. And then this is also where I exited essentially all of the remaining long options that I had.

But if you do that with something like options, you will be holding dust because they go away. You can't just hold them. Otherwise you will be holding nothing. Black Swan says, what made you exit the set call position? The stock wasn't accommodating. Yeah. I mean, that's really what it boils down to. That position was put on to attempt to capitalize on an upward price movement. There was not a corresponding upward price movement. So again, for me, the calculus literally is quite that simple, right? Like if I'm trading long calls, I want something to go up. If it's not going up, I don't have the right position on. That's essentially the basis. Jacob says, if you know it's going to dump at market open, would you risk selling at open when it's volatile? Sure. But if you have long calls selling when it's volatile is good anyways. That expansion and volatility helps the long calls.

    "text": "market open, would you risk selling at open when it's volatile? Sure. But if you have long calls selling when it's volatile is good anyways. That expansion and volatility helps the long calls. If you have long calls and volatility starts to decay out, your long calls will decline in premium as will all other options as volatility starts to bleed out. So the problem you'll have in that instance is depending on the expiration of the long calls is how illiquid they are. That's one of the reasons why I took my options positions that I'm buying to the upside. My long calls further out in time because one of the problems you're going to have, and we went through an example of this before and if on-demand works, I'd love to show you again, because it's a good message to share with you guys. Because one of the issues that you'll have is if there is a big accommodating move, even if it's in your favor, liquidity is going to widen out in something like GameStop massively. So then it's really difficult to get out of your options at a fair price. It's actually kind of a giant problem. So that's also why I use a mix of options and shares because I don't want to get stuck if liquidity dries up too much and I can't get a decent fill. That would be really annoying if you get a good price moving your favor, but then the",

Hey, hey, hey, hey, there we go. It worked. Beautiful. So, yeah, let's take a look at an example. Oh, this makes me super excited. The chart doesn't work, but who cares? We don't really need the chart. I do need to go back and pick a day though. So let's pick one May and then let's pick, I guess we could do the 14th. That doesn't even have to be the 14th, but we could use the 14th, 14th May. Now let's take a look at a quick example together. So if I go to 1 May, 1 May, let me go to the options. If this works, that would be absolutely fantastic. That would be a giant fan. And there we go. Cool. This is great. So now let's pick something like, let's take a look at this 17 May and let's pretend that we want to buy this at the money.

And then let's take a look at something closer to what I would put on, which would be something like this. Yeah, something like that. All right. Now let's fast forward to 14 May. What I want to do is show you what the liquidity looks like on these different contracts. Right now you can see that there, you know, maybe 30 cents wide, 32 cents wide, something like that for these tens, right? So just remember the, let me get out of your way. The bin asked spread there. I think my, I got an alert from, oh, perfect. My door dashes on the way. So now take a look at the width here. Let me get out of the way.

I want to make sure that if that point makes sense to you guys. The idea that as things become more volatile, the premium of options will increase, but the liquidity of options will also widen out to a degree. It leads to a bit of a problem.

When did he put that those stream of emojis out? When did that happen? Do you guys know? You guys probably know better than me. Afonso says I checked there's no fidelity tab on his live stream.

The problem in my opinion is well, a few things like the dog here. Would I have guessed that he was projecting out in time from the 15th of May that on the 20 what was it the 24th? Is that right? Let me see. We don't need this anymore. This June 24. So do I think that this here is him flagging on the 15th of May that on the 24th of June that he's going to buy chewy? I personally don't see that. Personally. And the reason being is because I and he could have done that. I want to be very clear like this is just my guess. He could have done that. But my guess is against that specifically because he's he can't know what Chewy's going to look like on that day at that point. And there's a really, really good chance",

But my guess is against that specifically because he's he can't know what Chewy's going to look like on that day at that point. And there's a really, really good chance that if things didn't look right for some reason or if new information was injected into this series before it happened, that that probably wouldn't have happened. Right. So I think yeah, to me, I just think that he might be trolling a little bit grabbing this from a Missy Elliott song, which is hilarious. And I think he also knows that people really, really look into things. And my guess is he probably has some fun with that. So if we take a look, I want to show you guys this interview really quick with Ryan Cohen. And there was a really funny part in this interview that I saw. I think it was maybe a podcast. This year. So I'm going to you guys should be able to hear the volume and stuff, but there's there's one in particular we need to look at. For go for it. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Good shorts. This one. And while this is playing, I'm actually going to grab my dog real quick.

All right, Virginia. It's a photo of you in a game stop store. May 12, 2021. I think that's pretty self explanatory. I think there was an article that came out that claimed you were ghost shopping.

Yeah, more recently, I have a harder to do. Okay. Okay. Now, when I wrote about this on our website, I noted what was in your hand. And we spent a lot of time trying to figure out we thought it was a scooter, an electric scooter. Yes, it was not an electric scooter though, but it was a scooter. Just a non electric scooter.

And I think this is a good reminder of sometimes that there it's just it's just not meant to be you know necessarily something that in depth in that the games weren't associated in a specific manner. You know, nothing like that. So yeah, back to the emojis thing, I just I have a hard time seeing it personally. That's not like of course a bunch of this stuff could line up with different things that that's the nature of something like emojis is that they're so simple and open ended that you can look at these things in a million different ways. So it makes them highly applicable. It's like the same thing that you'll find with a lot of bullshit internet stock gurus who they'll say shit like blah blah blah blah. Could be support or could be resistance. Well, so well, no shit Sherlock like price can move. Thank you for that revelation. But the point being is it's just it's just a broad statement so that if something happens even closely aligned to what that person said then they get to say like oh well, it means this which that's probably not what they meant at the point of saying it. So the lag says but the Larry Chang aspect is a direct vision for the future of the company that's all I need. Yeah, I agree. I think Larry Chang",

I think Larry Chang from what I've read is he seems like a really cool dude. I'd love to talk to him and just learn a little bit more about how he views all this stuff because it's very interesting to me. Now let's keep going with this. The idea here is that he's trying to reenact 2021 and why would he use chewy over game stop. It talks about it being heavily shorted that the buyback pulled away liquidity and enormous buy and triggered a VWOP order to settle the trade. This I need to learn more about the way that you guys think about VWOP orders because it's it looks like the way you guys might think about them. Might differ a bit from the way I would think about it. But anyways, the biggest holding of XRT shorted 300 yep that makes sense Sanworm is approaching. There is no way this trade settled okay okay so far this looks reasonable to me. DFE sold 225 million worth of game stop. To buy chewy. Yeah, I think I mean I think that that makes sense. I probably would assume the same thing there I think that's okay. Oh, I get why that's",

Yeah, no so to be clear like I know what they are I'm just trying to understand the way that you guys think about it in terms of like why that would be so impactful here a VWOP order why not a different kind of order why not any other order type why specifically a VWOP order. But the reason why I asked that question is I'm gaining context about how the community in this in this context interpolates the the tool itself because again like there's a million other order types that could occur here. So I'm trying to understand that emphasis specifically on a VWOP order from like a standard practitioner standpoint I totally understand why like for somebody like Newton I could see why he would like a VWOP order because it's essentially putting you in where a lot of other people like something so yeah I from a from Newton standpoint I get it but from something like this I don't fully get it and that's what I'm trying to understand.

So from like my interpolation of this is that it's expected that there's some some sort of. There's an expectation that funds use VWOPs specifically. And because funds and other entities use VWOPs as conditional buying circumstances that it would lend efficacy behind if he buys moving into other VWOP resting VWOP or penning resting VWOP order types that it would cause a big move like that's my guess. But I don't know and that's exactly why I'm asking the question to see if you guys are looking at this in the context of some sort of value idea if it's some sort of technical component like I'm talking about in terms of.

    "text": "the fuck did you say can you explain it to me can you explain it as if we eat crayons. That's so funny. How do I think that's so funny I love that response so much. Let me think about it so there's a there are different order types that mean things to different entities there's things like T Wops and VWOPs T Wops or time weighted average price VWOP is volume weighted average price. So they mean slightly different things but when you look at big institutions they're incentivized to try and manage entry price that's essentially why we have things like dark pools is it is the effort of those entities to manage their entry prices to avoid being pushed around or people front running the orders and moving things. So like a great example of this is the flash crash in 2010 that was essentially a messed up order entry where they used VWOP instead of T WOP which would have helped their exposure and it would have moved completely different. So they'll use those kinds of order types to fill positions while trying to be more sensitive to entry price and to not be front ran this is again like institutional side of things so when I think about this theory in general that's what I would personally take away that it's predicated on that behavior but I didn't know from your guys perspective like what this looks like or what I'm going to do.

So let me know if that makes sense as if you e crayons the summary of that is institutions might want to use these and it's to try and be more price sensitive I think that's the best guess. So anyways back to this this makes sense to me and then this also makes sense right like because I know and this is something that Newton is brought up and we've had good conversations about it I'm still unsure because from Newton sheet it shows that essentially R K is never decreased his position size one of the problems with Newton sheets is that he has so much stuff. So often here that's difficult to find. Did I pass it already. Over here there it is over to the right is a cheeky over to the right so what Newton showed me is that he's never decreased his shares now again I see Newton's point but the way I look at it is. I am not convinced that R K is maintained static positions essentially from the time that he's added each of these we know this probably not to be true with the most recent trade in chewy like it",

So I don't know maybe you guys have seen him sell calls before like in some of his other updates I just haven't seen that yet and it doesn't necessarily fully seem to align with the positions that I've seen him share with us because he could have sold calls at a bunch of different points here.

Let's finish going through this before a hop off and if there's anything else you guys want to hit quick before I bounce feel free to start throwing those in now so that I don't leave you hanging. This makes sense essentially saying that he probably. Exited and he's just providing you know basis for it. This is looking at potentially when he sold it looks like which I could see right that's a lot of volume down volume. Purchased 9 million 25 to 25 up that lines up selling price 27 and a half a point to yep I could see this. Alright so what's the plan. So he thinks the move is going to be in chewy.

Right like I can predict where I think the stock market is going to go in two years and with something like positive drift I know it's pretty fair certainty that it will be higher. I'm going to know about Michael Burry in the big short though is he missed time to his entry terribly and he almost went insolvent he almost had to close the fund he had to go to extremes essentially disallowing people from pulling their money out because if they did he wouldn't have been able to hold the position long enough in order for it to potentially pay out. So the first thing is Michael Burry's position was predicated on really hard data observable data that can you literally can draw very logical conclusions from the idea that with those kinds of positions and seeing essentially the way that MBS securities were being built that like his conclusion was very very much. And the other thing I would offer with just context for Burry is that if you watch the rest of his calls he's been wrong a ton and that's not to cast rocks I'm wrong a ton myself we're all wrong a lot.

And the other thing I would offer with just context for Burry is that if you watch the rest of his calls he's been wrong a ton and that's not to cast rocks I'm wrong a ton myself we're all wrong a lot. But that's the nature of predictions right is Michael Burry is really remembered for that one that he got right in a really big way because of how harrowing of a story that was. The kind of over shadows all the other times that were completely wrong and that's essentially some of what you see there so yeah I think. Yeah I think it's important because it's completely reasonable to make predictions and it's part of the process of being a trader but it's a difficult game I think. Payton says the flag emoji Mike emoji and then music L S XM plus Siri. I don't know I again like I don't really mess with the emoji change too much I just I just struggle way too much to believe that he would again like even that right there right if he made that post on 15 May. I just do not see him essentially forecasting the creation of those three emojis to mean 16 aug calls like I just I don't see that. So yeah I mean to me I don't really I don't see much there. Payton says what do you think about. No he is in the 16 aug calls",

Payton says what do you think about. No he is in the 16 aug calls now that's from saying is like I don't see I don't see the connection there Payton you're saying that. He knew that yeah so here's the deal that merger has been on the table for a long time I think people are really really mistaken about this the Siri merger. This has been announced for literally since December of 2023. So what he did not know is when this merger would gain any semblance of traction because it's been underway for so long. Mergers take a long time so what I'm saying is of course you knew about the merger we all knew about the merger literally from last year we knew about the we knew about the merger. So what I'm a fonds of says first emoji was not on the 15th but the 12th if it matters thanks for thanks for the correction at least it doesn't matter in the context that I'm talking about it but it's useful and I'd rather have the correct date anyway so I appreciate it. But what I'm highlighting here is like this merger is not new and when he made that post specifically on the 12th then I don't think that",

So again I want to go all the way back could that have been the case it could it could like technically it could but I just view that is a highly low probability event personally. So. Pains is what do you think of the chain. He could be anybody could be yeah so the thing is is like I have no idea what we're in kiddie is trading I have no idea but it there's a lot of activity in here anything that's going through the process of a merger or acquisition it's going to be super active because people are going to speculate on whatever they believe the terminal value of the product is going to be a lot of activity in here.

So here's the deal there's the original rumor of a buyout right stock shoots up on the buyout news hangs out then news of the buyout starts to get digested it looks like it's complicated looks like it might get blocked and it starts to decline then it looks like there's better news about the buyout higher probability price drifts up towards the buyout price. Then it essentially falls through Elon starts seeing all these shit about fake accounts starts trying to back out of the buyout and then all of a sudden Twitter falls back down to pre buyout levels hangs out hangs out hangs out until it starts looking like buyout probability is going to start going up and then you can see when the probability of the buyout became near terminal with this giant skyrocketing price and then post price drift this is when the market became more certain",

And it eventually happened what on 28 October something like that is that right. Jordan is it I don't remember no not October I forgot exactly when the buyout happened but the cash merger this says 1028 so in this case anyways what I'm highlighting is you're seeing something that from the literally April out until November was going through the cycle of trying to understand this buyout opportunity it's the anything that's going through a merger acquisition goes through a similar path because there's a lot of hurdles they have to get over some of them are still happening that you've heard of before with really big companies. So yeah all I'm saying is that this the buyout with serious nothing new the information there is nothing new it's been digested for a long time and the options chains being active in something like Siri is completely predictable because of the merger news people like me will trade that all the time now something like this you can come up with a lot of interesting ideas based on where you see most of the activity.
