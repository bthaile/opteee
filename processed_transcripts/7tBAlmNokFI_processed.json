I'm trying to learn So if I say anything in the process of this that is offensive or um sounds ignorant It is because I'm highly ignorant on the topic I don't actually understand this like why are these two different places not like Joined because everything that I can see From Superstong Seems to be about GameStop and I see that that's in the description here And I think Newton explained a little bit about the breakoff between Superstong From Wall Street bats so that part I get to a degree I think But this one I don't fully understand And the other thing is I don't actually know who came first.

Okay, so it's just slightly different slightly slightly different perspectives on what they can focus on Eric what up Eric Eric says usually people banned from Superstong head over to GME okay got it That's helpful so And then gravittarius says I've noticed Superstong is a bit more hardcore interesting I also wouldn't have guessed that So that's really helpful context for me. So I appreciate it. Thank you Yeah, I was just trying to understand how these two communities operated in conjunction with one another Because they both have really interesting data sets what I like to do in here what I'm trying to like learn more about this stuff as I just go into the top post of all time and see What we have So this is That's interesting And this is another interesting component that I find is that like there is just a universal hate towards this homie which makes sense to be clear that that also doesn't surprise me at all Zack says there's also one called D.F.V.

It's not limited to just to just This specific entity. So it's something to look at it's something to try to bake into the picture I think just out of curiosity, but I also don't think um, yeah, I don't necessarily I think there's a lot of noise is the way I should say that Um Let me see Markets says can you talk about the upcoming 16 all GME options who are bag holding yeah definitely I Can absolutely do that that is I'm way way more well versed in that Before we take a look at that though Marquette really quick. I just wanted to share a few studies with you guys this one is really cool So Let me throw this in here. So these are all different papers Share to ton with newton to",

So these are all different papers Share to ton with newton to include on like short squeezes gamma squeezes This is how I analyze information is I'm looking for broad objective data sets that I can then integrate into my own data set And try to learn if you don't like reading white papers. This will be terribly annoying for you I recommend just dropping it into chat gpt But when you do that stuff with chat gpt always ask it for what are the limitations of this research Don't just say what what are the takeaways because if you just get the takeaways and you don't understand the limitations of the research You're getting a highly skewed picture that I don't think is the best use of your time and effort. So yeah anyways I wanted to share those with you guys before we moved on. Okay, so now following up with Marquette asking about 16 all GME options. Yes, we can do that I guess maybe we could start with just a quick broad overview. I'll do a lot of this in the in kind of like my standard video update tomorrow So we don't have to go super far in depth Also, this is a Arnold Palmer absolutely fantastic",

I could see why somebody might do that But I don't think it actually makes a lot of sense We can talk about it, but I wouldn't personally make that comparison But this is what I wanted to show you guys When games stop starting to get like really poised to move higher Take a look at the disposition and the options before the move started So this is this is still When it was down grinding lower it created this Look like short-term base at about 10 And then it was grinding a little bit higher But it hasn't even made that breakout move yet to the upside the initial leg up It hasn't made that yet And if you take a look at the options There's 414,000 calls To 106,000 puts So it's it's literally almost four times calls to puts And this is before that move. This is why options are so informative You can see a lot of information and options. It's how I caught this most recent move. It's how I traded the squeeze Back in 2021 is through identifying stuff like this So anyways What I'm highlighting to you is before the move even started and even if you include Roaring kiddie's position in here, which was 120,000 right Take those 120,000 out of this it's still three times Calls",

They did the mistake once trace three times. What else could it be? Oh no I definitely think it's largely retail. Yeah I wouldn't say that It's all retail This is also a place for institutions to get cheap hedging depending on what kind of trades they're putting on But This is yeah, I mean, it's pretty clear that like this is absolutely a mix of retail The reason why it's so clear to me is because if you look at the transactions so many of them are one lots And again like institutions They're not going to use one lot. It's just so grossly inefficient for them to try to place those trades So it just in order to build any sort of size that they would want So Yeah, I don't really think Yeah, like I don't really think It's not retail.

I literally retired my mom because I figured out how to do this shit And it's a really powerful skill set once it's understood the problem is So many instances people start trading like myself with really terrible terrible understanding of what they're getting into And expectations and then it leads to people just losing tons of money unnecessarily so one of my Big objectives there is to try to put stuff out to slow people down from doing that like that's There's a video that I have here and I'll I'll share it in here Literally every single time I have an opportunity to share this video. I do and The video is about buying call options smarter and that's literally exactly what it's called It's a 16-minute video about this exact thing so that video Goes into structuring trades at least what I would consider to be smarter So that it's not necessarily just lighting money on fire continually. But anyways back to this So we're gonna get rid of the bids. We're gonna look at the 125s specifically so we can kill the puts And then we need to look specifically for people that are gaining exposure in 18 Sure, I'm sorry 16 Oh and then let's do strike price minimum 125 which is also the maximum so we don't have to put into So",

This is not tracking all of the transactions This is looking at the larger transactions. That's what these platforms do I have another platform Well, really it's a data source opera that I can pull all of the data for if we wanted But really I just want to highlight the fact that a lot of these positions in general Are being entered in much smaller size right? So like the total premium for this trade is a thousand bucks This one right here. So it's just there's just not much size going on here So more often than not there's Again, like this isn't probably an institution building some sort of position They would have to do a lot of this and you can look the way it's deconflected by time That's probably not the case Like these look like smaller traders or it could be you know smaller institutions.

Yeah the way that I think about Trading is options are a tool and they They have their place They're not inherently better than a bunch of other tools But they do afford a lot of opportunities that are not afforded by things like equity So that that is a reality behind these products and I absolutely think that that's something to be aware of for people Because it's there's they offer a lot of opportunity is what it boils down to I Adam says don't understand why there's zero interest in two stocks that have almost perfect correlation Uh, I didn't see your talk.

Let's say it's like towards the bottom Let's say he gets in at like 255 his other trades do tend to seem to be like towards the morning So I imagine it would be close. So let's call it like 2529 or 253 25.3 I literally just typed in 25.6 as I said 25.3 because I'm an idiot So 9 million 1000 shares He needs 227 million 725,300 So what I'm going to do is drop that in the chat here so I keep track of that number.

Let's literally look at this on that day. Let's go to 24 June In Chewy and we'll go back in time. Welcome to the time machine June 24 Monday Let's see So what I can tell you Is that it didn't happen very first thing on the open at least as of yet Because I do not see any meaningful volume coming in although it is starting to drift up indicating to me some level of Some level of buying And then just so you know right now it's pre-buffering. That's why we're just chilling James says That's funny James Barrett says James Rowland is saying stuff about weekly and monthly triggers I don't know what that means, but it would be interested.

Anyways, back to this in the general hypothesis. So The reason why I care about this is because if you can use options when filling in a 13G so does a 13G Apply to options The reason why this matters because if you can use options you can put this position on much more cheaply than before so This says yes. This is from This whatever this is This says 13G of Securities Act 1934 applies to cash settled options That use okay, so that's actually helpful because this says cash settled options, which is not these This includes derivatives that are not offered sold originate with the issuer Uh Item six to form to include the description.

I'm completely out of them But I have short options against some of my shares Meaning sold calls against some of the shares And it's literally to just make it easier to hold those shares as the underlying is trending sideways But I already started phasing out of my long share position as well. I paired it down quite a lot Because of these two moves And then this is also where I exited essentially all of the remaining long options that",

Yeah, I mean that's really what it boils down to the that position was put on To attempt to capitalize on an upward price movement There was not a corresponding upward price movement. So again for me the calculus literally is quite that simple right like If I'm trading long calls. I want something to go up if it's not going up. I don't have the right position on That's essentially the basis Uh, Jacob says if you know it's going to dump at market open would you risk selling at open when it's volatile sure Because if you have long calls selling when it's volatile is good anyways that expansion and volatility helps your helps the long calls If",

Yeah, definitely so Yeah, I totally get that Nightham says what the fuck did you say can you explain it to me? Can you explain it as if we eat crayons? Oh, that's so funny Um How do I think that's so funny. I love that response so much Um Yeah, let me think about it. So there's a there are different order types that mean things to different entities There's things like T-wops and VWOPs T-wops are time weighted average price VWOP is volume weighted average price So they mean slightly different things But when you look at big institutions they're incentivized to try and manage entry price That's essentially why we have things like dark pools is it is the effort of those entities to manage their entry prices to avoid being pushed around or people front running the orders and moving things so Like a great example of this is the flash crash in 2010 that was essentially a A messed up Order entry where they used VWOP instead of T-wop which would have helped their exposure and it would have moved completely different So they'll use those kinds of order types to fill positions while trying to be more sensitive to entry price and To",

I'm wrong a ton myself. We're all wrong a lot But that's the nature of predictions right is Michael Burry is really remembered for that one that he got right in a really big way Because of how harrowing of a story that was The kind of overshadows all the other times that were completely wrong and that's essentially some of what you see there So yeah, I think Yeah, I think it's important because it's completely reasonable to make predictions and it's part of the process of being a traitor But it's a difficult game I think Uh, Peyton says the flag emoji mic emoji and then music ls xm plus Siri Uh, I don't know I again like I don't really mess with the emoji change too much.
