    "text": "Why do people trade options? It really boils down to the fact that they are tactical investments. They allow you to create things that are very specific. One of those things is they provide a lot of leverage. So if we take a look at buying 100 shares of Tesla at 317, that essentially would take up 31,000 to put the position on. If Tesla goes up by 15, you would make 47-61, 4761 bucks. Good day. Whereas if you put on the equivalent size position using long-dated options, your position would be up 15,800 for the same amount of money. That's leverage. Now, leverage gives, leverage takes. There's drawbacks to this, such as if Tesla doesn't move, then you might start losing some of the value of your options. Now, again, you can mitigate that by going further out in time, and really buy a series of steps to buy options. Smarter. I have a video that talks about that that I will share with you below. But options can provide leverage among other things. You know, I'll be later.",
