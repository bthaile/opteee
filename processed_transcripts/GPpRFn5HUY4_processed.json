    "text": "Man, oh man, what a busy week for this guy. You guys have sent me so much material to take a look at asking me to explore these different thesis and hypothesis and cycles that people think may or may not be happening. And I've been spending dozens of hours consuming and trying to understand and synthesize the data set. So I was watching the video from Biggie Smalls from Reddit. I've been watching a bunch of different Richard Noons video. I got one pulled up right now. And man, how fun is the puzzle? I'm having a blast from somebody like me that's been in markets for so long. I'm in my 17th year of trading. Finding really interesting things like this to try to dissect is very entertaining for me. It's just a cool thought exercise to run through. So what I'm working on now is actually a model that takes the different rulesets that they're outlining in terms of their assessment of when a cycle kicks off and some of the different things that might emerge over the course of a cycle and seeing if we can project forward any of it. Because the guys are doing a great job, specifically trying to stay as objective as possible. Nobody's like pontificating this is what's happening. Most of them are saying things like if this is the case, if this is true, which is massive. That's really important for you people that watch the videos because what you",

That's really important for you people that watch the videos because what you don't need are people that are skewing the way you receive information as you can tell them very against that. I want you guys to be able to make your own inferences based on the data that we can find and they're doing a great job at that. So I'm hopeful that maybe I can help pitch in in a really small way, but I'm mostly learning from them in terms of these theories. They're incredible. Now I'm not ready to dive into any of that yet. It's way too early. I need to collect a much larger data sample. I did a bunch of different money, Carlos simulations to get an idea of what this could look like using some historic data to shape the model. But it's way too early. I don't want to throw noise out there when we're really trying to solve a puzzle. So until I have something a little more concrete, I'm going to continue sticking to what I know to do, which is looking at options, markets, looking at markets in general and seeing what's going on. And today is the 23rd of June and we are back at another interesting weekend. So",

And today is the 23rd of June and we are back at another interesting weekend. So what I'm doing now is comparing the options chain from 21 June to 23 June. And I'm looking at a few different things. I'm tracking this expansion of volatility for each expiration cycle across all of them, essentially going all the way out the full options chain. And I want to see what the variance or the delta and volatility is between the 21st and the 23rd. I want to see how they're calculating that on a vol per day remaining. And I'm kind of building this out in parallel because one of my ideas is market makers are pretty smart. So if this is something that we on the retail side are starting to get a glimpse at, my hypothesis is the market makers already know all of this. I have to make that assumption because they get to see all this data. We're piecing it together from all these other pieces. And yet they already have the picture because they're pretty much the ones executing it. And especially in biggie small idea in terms of them internalizing orders. There's a lot of questions I have with that just in terms of the sourcing of the shares and stuff",

There's a lot of questions I have with that just in terms of the sourcing of the shares and stuff like that. But again, I'm not looking to add a bunch of conjecture out there. I'm just looking to understand right now, right? Just like our boy, what was it? Seven habits of highly successful people seek first to understand then to be understood. So I'm very much in that first phase seeking to understand now when I look across the options chains. The very first thing I'm noticing is that the absolute gross variance in volatility per day is essentially happening 19 July and in because that takes us even to 20 or 0.2 vol variance on a per day basis going out 2060 to and then it really starts to drop off precipitously beyond that. So what that tells me is that we're still seeing relatively more action in these near term explorations, which is very common. That's nothing super novel with options in general. The front explorations to rivetives really across the board. We'll see way more activity in the front explorations are going to be more liquid and more active stuff like that. So nothing in here screaming at me as strange. What is strange to me though is looking at the variance variance in volatility",

So nothing in here screaming at me as strange. What is strange to me though is looking at the variance variance in volatility between this coming week and the next week. This is very big. So the change that we've seen so far in volatility from the 21st to the 23rd for this 28 June expiration cycle is not insignificant. So 27.7 point variance in vol, which is 5.55 vol per day as compared to everything else which is sub 1. So again, this goes back to kind of this standard game of hypothesizing what's going on. And one of the things I noticed right out of the gate, let's look at the out of the monies is that we're seeing the same massive call implied volatility skew. So again, the reason why I put the cursor here is so that you can see where it caps out on the put side, which is right now like 4748 something like that. And on the call side, we have vols all the way out at the 128s. That's like 580. And again, we can confirm it by going out here. We could pop out to those 128s. Take a look at the current vault 580 right on the nose. So a few things going on here, the first one, there's a lot of activity",

So a few things going on here, the first one, there's a lot of activity in these really far out of the monies. And this is probably a lot of people throwing their money away, genuinely speaking. And I don't want to see that. And I say it that way because I made a video that a link in the description below for you to check out on how to buy call options specifically and things like GameStop smarter. Because what's happening is the market makers are juicing up these really far out of the money premiums. And again, this isn't necessarily to like screw it to the retail traders. It's because if they assess risk, that's where they're going to try and cover their risk. And what that means is as they're trying to make a market way out here in the nose bleeds, they have to carry this crazy inventory that again for something like GameStop, there's always the puncher's chance that this thing just flies off the handle and you don't know when yet waiting to see how much headway we can make on these different cycle hypothesis.

And I actually one of the things one of the reasons why I'm tracking volatility like this is I actually think we might be able to see the market makers pricing it in if they know it's going to happen before it happens. Now it's kind of difficult because sometimes with these really far out of the money strikes, there will be kind of flash orders that could send out there by the market makers. And that's because they don't want to expose their volatility calculations if there's no market being made right now. So essentially what that means is they'll rest orders at a wall that they don't actually think it is right now. But if people start coming in to kind of trade on the market, they would update their orders. And this is more of competition between market makers as compared to you versus them. But anyway, you should know that that's a thing as well. So when I am looking at this chain, I'm seeing a ton of really far out of the money options. Now this becomes really, really important. If big if if GameStop starts rising like crazy, if GameStop starts flying up, this creates massive buying demand from market makers",

If big if if GameStop starts rising like crazy, if GameStop starts flying up, this creates massive buying demand from market makers because here's the deal right now, even for these right here. For example, there's 14,600 volume at the 30s it looks like. And there are only a 21 delta. So right now, the market makers aren't super incentivized to carry a full hedge. They probably maybe uses a bettics the way that they do their businesses, obviously, discrete to them. I don't know. But we know kind of the general approaches that they will take. What we do know is that there's no incentive for them to have 100 shares in their account to cover this 21 delta position. We know that. The reason why it becomes really interesting if there's a big price increase is because as these get closer to at the money, the market makers need to accumulate more shares unless they can internalize the order, meaning provide from their own inventory. That creates buying pressure. The more that that happens, the more that they have to hedge. This is exactly what a gamma squeeze is. That's the primary differentiator between a gamma squeeze and a short squeeze is a gamma squeeze is driven by market maker activities. They're just trying to hedge their position to capture",

They're just trying to hedge their position to capture the bid-asks, spread and go home with the money that they made on the spread. But in order to do that, they need to get rid of and scrub off the excess risk. Because the thing is for options that are further in the money, especially like 60 delta plus, they already have most of the position if not all of it hedged, especially as it gets closer to expiration. But for these out of the money, they're not at that point because they're more likely than not going to expire out of the money. But if for whatever reason, there's a catalyst that starts driving price, then they're forced to start hedging these in a really short term time frame. That is where things start to get very interesting. Does that mean that's going to happen this week? We have no idea yet. We literally have no idea yet.

There could be a theory that the market was trying to scrub the price below the 24 handle. Why would they want to do that? Because then the 24s then expire worthless. And that's close enough, but that's not outside the realm of possibility. Now, especially with something that had really low relative volume, there's 28 million shares on the 21st. So going into this week, what I'm really wanting to keep a close eye on is how does the front wall play? I want to keep an eye on this smile because my expectation if this week follows anything like last week is the put side is going to start jacking up, which again for options traders, that's a tradable event. You can trade the expansion and put side wall compared on a relative basis to the call side wall. Or both of them in conjunction, which is probably even more likely the case in this scenario because we saw both the put and call side wall for the far out of the money is jack up into the expiration this past week.
