    "text": "What's up outliers? Today we are going to talk about the exact process I would follow if I were to start learning about options again. Now, I already have a couple of videos about how to start trading options and things like that. I'll link to those in the notes below, but I want to actually zoom it up one level because I think if you're anything like me, you probably just started learning about options in trying things where you can and kind of hoping that you can piece it together. And I actually think this is a giant mistake that we all make. So the goal of this video is to walk you through four big guiding concepts that I think you should keep in mind as you go through this process of learning to trade options. And the funny part is, is you're going to notice a lot of it isn't even about options specifically, and I'll explain why. What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the outliers. Let's get right back into this. So the first of our four steps is define profit mechanism. And this is plural. You can have multiple profit mechanisms. Why would I start with this? If I'm talking about learning to trade options, why am I even bothering with a profit mechanism, why am I not diving directly into what calls are, what puts are and things like that? Well, it's because options are simply vehicles to express an opinion. There's no",

If I'm talking about learning to trade options, why am I even bothering with a profit mechanism, why am I not diving directly into what calls are, what puts are and things like that? Well, it's because options are simply vehicles to express an opinion. There's no magic in an option. There's leverage, which is kind of magical. There's volatility, also pretty sick, but there's nothing that inherently makes them profitable. And if you're anything like me, when we first start trading options, we start learning all these intricate details about charm, vanna. We want to know about the velocity of gamma. We want to know about theta decay. We want to know about expiration cycles, earnings releases, all these kinds of things, which are important to know, we'll get to that in a little bit. But none of that matters if you don't actually know what you're trying to trade to make money. This is something we almost always all universally overlook. So what I offer is a way to break down this broader problem set into a simpler one. And whether or not you want to trade directionally for price up or down, if you want to trade volatility direction, if you want to trade structural volatility, there's lots of different profit mechanisms that are out there. And if you spend some time digging around SSRN, you'll find tons of them. And if you're in the Patreon, I have an entire archive of hundreds of",

And if you spend some time digging around SSRN, you'll find tons of them. And if you're in the Patreon, I have an entire archive of hundreds of studies that essentially talk about all these different kinds of things. But it doesn't matter if you know all of the intricate details about selling a strangle, if you sell a strangle in something that's exhibiting a breakout, you're wrong. You're going to lose money, no matter how well you understand those options. So this is the very first step to learning how to trade options is understanding something that makes money. So for example, if we grab the platform and we take a look at Tiva, just kind of picking a random one here, but it exhibits two things side by side. I can show you a price direction breakout here that was fueled by good earnings that then turned into positive drift and momentum over the next quarter. This is representative of a phenomenon called Pied, post earnings announcement drift. It's that is a profit mechanism. So whether you have a system to trade these breakouts, whether you have a system to trade the subsequent drift, whatever it is, whatever the profit mechanism is, doesn't matter, but you need a profit mechanism. So what I'm not worried about with that is, am I going to trade a vertical",

So what I'm not worried about with that is, am I going to trade a vertical haul spread or am I going to trade a bold put spread? None of it matters. What matters up front is understanding how you make money. This is the first step unequivocally. So another example here of structural volatility is this concept of variance risk premiums. And if you're unfamiliar with what that is and what IV is, how all that works, I have another video. I will link to down below for you to check out. But essentially, we know that in general, the market over prices implied volatility relative to historic volatility. And the way to visualize that here is the yellow lines or implied volatility. The white lines are historic volatility. Notice how in general, the yellow lines are above the white lines. That just tells us what we already know and it visualizes it for you. That implied volatility tends to be overstated relative to historic volatility. That's another profit mechanism. So again, it doesn't matter in this scenario. If you know all of the intricate details about the new name option strategy, the flying dragon spitting lizard, it doesn't matter. This is ultimately what matters is how can you find things that make money and",

If you know all of the intricate details about the new name option strategy, the flying dragon spitting lizard, it doesn't matter. This is ultimately what matters is how can you find things that make money and then how can you measure it? Because whether you're good at trading directly up or down, whether you're good at trading volatility is going to come down to your ability to identify reliably, somewhat, those circumstances. And to find signals that help you see them before it happens because obviously in this scenario, it's so easy to look back and say, yeah, post earnings announcement drift, crushed it on earnings and then it drifted up over time. Yeah, I can see that historically. But the name of the game is, if we're looking at the stock market here, can we make that same inference? So the whole idea is once we define these different profit mechanisms that we want to trade and this is not exhaustive, there's tons more. We then need to measure them, understand how they work and then we need to figure out how to find them. So how do we identify different signals that correspond to them and then create scans that help us find them? So for example, if I go into my platform, I built a scan here that helps me look over variance risk premiums. And then I have a tool here that",

So for example, if I go into my platform, I built a scan here that helps me look over variance risk premiums. And then I have a tool here that then helps me sort by stocks that exhibit the most variance risk premiums. So if we take a look at BYND and we pull up in this, you're gonna see those yellow lines way ahead of the white lines. That's variance risk premiums. I can see them, I can look for them. So this is the next step in your process. Notice how I haven't even said the word options yet because again, it doesn't matter if you know everything about options, if you cannot find the conditions to trade them in, which is what most of us do. We jump into this next stage, which is now you get to learn about options. Now is the point where you get to start getting into all the details, your options 101, how they work, how they behave, what basic structures exist. This is where we learn about options. This is where you learn about the Greeks. This is where you pull up the outlier trading, options trading for beginner series, which has been going on every Friday for the past 12 Fridays and learn about options.

Then after we get through this stage of learning about options, we build strategies. And I have a video that goes in depth on how to build trading strategies. So if we look at this in a nutshell, when we're going through these two stages, outlining fitting structures that match the profit mechanism and then building strategies, this is where you start using tools like this, like the trading plan that I offer. Again, this is for the Patreon folks, but I've done videos on this. I'll link to them in the notes below that you can make your own. You can follow along in that video completely for free and do your own. And then if you're in the Patreon, you can just grab an example from here. But this is where we start codifying what we're trying to do.

So now you might be saying, well, how do I actually learn about options? It's a great question. Once you get to this step, I would recommend hop over to my website. Again, you can go into the Resources tab here and then literally just go to this, the Outlier Options Trading Beginners Guide. You'll see that it takes a second to load because it's kind of a big file, but it'll load within the window here if you're so inclined. I literally provide you a syllabus. I tell you the things that I think make sense to learn in what order, what we should try to learn in each of them. And then I give you some reading materials that I think make sense to read as you go along. And then again, what I offer down at the bottom, if you go to this next page is literally a syllabus or each and every one of those topics with sub topics that I think make sense. This is available to everybody for free. You can go check this out and you can start learning in an organized fashion. But before you even start this process here, we",

And that's not going to bowed well. So this is exactly what I would do.
