We've connected pretty much every quarter, like pretty consistently for a couple of years now. And I would love first to just start with a quick recap of 24 because when we connected in the beginning of 2024, you had an expectation of this really strong rally, the melt up and then leading eventually into the global bus. And originally, we were thinking that that might be happening towards the tail end of last year. Obviously, circumstances continue to change. That's actually a follow up question I have for you for a little bit. But I would love to just get an overview from you on 2024. What were the key themes that stuck out to you? Yeah, well, certainly, yeah, we had bought, we had had a pretty good correction going into the fall of 23 came out of that in October early November of 23. And it took until I think February, if I remember right before we started taking off, maybe that was just the medals. But I had raised my target 7,000, I think in January of 24. And we had a run and we had a correction, another run. And then August yet, and we had the big probably the biggest story of of 24 was the Japanese Yankei trade unwind. It didn't take very long, but",

And then August yet, and we had the big probably the biggest story of of 24 was the Japanese Yankei trade unwind. It didn't take very long, but it was pretty, pretty sharp and scared a lot of people and a lot of people turned to bear us there. And yet it bottomed in early August, you know, it was almost a one day sell off. There was some weakness leading up to it, but the biggest sell off was a one or two day deal. And then we basically had a pretty good run into the election and the week after the election. And then another kind of holiday run after Thanksgiving or into Thanksgiving and beyond. And then we thought we were going to have a year in rally and really from mid December and for the Russell early December, we had topped and corrected right into your end. So it surprised people, I think a little because everybody assumed we'd have a year in rally, but that's the market. You know, when everybody assumes something, you're going to probably get the opposite. And, you know, we're starting off this year kind of choppy. So what has been amazing is it has rebuilt the Wall of War. You know, it doesn't take a lot to have people, they got on board because of what the market",

Also, yeah, everybody raised it, you know, their numbers for 2025. They're there. You're in 25 Wall Street strategist year and 25 estimates all jumped up, you know, 6,500, 6,600, a couple of more at 7,000 or 7,100. And this was from a crowd that, you know, a group of people who had fought the rally all the way up from 3,500. You know, they just didn't think they had legs and kept moving. They were skeptical the whole way until, you know, really the last, you know, just leading at the election beyond. And then just as we get that and they climb on board, the bull bandwagon, we get this correction. And I think, you know, for the SP it was a less than 5 correction for the Nasdaq 6 or 6,500. And for the Russell it was over 10. But it's amazing to see that once you lose that momentum, and I had said this ahead of time, yeah, they're bullish, but they're bullish without any conviction.

They're bullish because they're going with the momentum of the tape. You lose that momentum and they're right back on the bearer side or at least skeptical side. And that's what you've seen here very recently. And so if you look at individual sentiment, because I just saw this number, the balls are down to like 20, I think 24, the bears are up to 40. And that had been the opposite, you know, just a few weeks ago. So it's amazing how quickly, you know, a little bit of a pullback can cause sentiment change. Absolutely. And it's one of the things I wanted to follow up there with is your original expectation of a meltup, meaning a really sharp parabolic move up. How does this change in sentiment feed into that? Because it does seem like things have stalled quite a lot. And exactly to your point, I actually found it generally interesting where essentially from December, it just seemed like the market was kind of waiting for the shoot to drop, which I surprised me a little bit because if we're expecting this really big rally, right, it seems like it would have to be supported by a ton of capital of some sort coming in.

So two questions there. The first one is, what do you think about the current marketing condition and how does that feed into the meltup concept? Yeah. Well, first of all, just to kind of clarify, meltup and parabolic meltup are two different things. Okay, sorry. The meltup, we've really had a meltup. You could argue, depending on how, why do you want to make the, how, why the perspective you want to have, if you broaden the market out to 20 year charts, you'd see the market's pretty vertical from 2022 from the lows in October 2022. And now some people think that was not that whole thing of the meltup, but we did, we did have a pretty long correction in the summer into the fall of 23. And then bottomed in October 23. So I, I really think the meltup is from my, that October 23 until now is we're in the meltup. The parabolic part of the meltup is that last stage into the top. And I had thought it was starting, I had thought it had started after the election. I said, at least possibly, you know, that 5 run in the week of the election. If it sustained itself was a",

So in sideways to down. So, so that wasn't the beginning of the parabolic. I think the parabolic just ahead of us. And I, you know, I think you could cover 30 in the S.A.P. in a matter of two or three months. Maybe it'll take longer, maybe it'll take four or five. But that's a lot of return in a hurry. Huge. And so that just to clarify those two, then, then if you could refresh my memory on your questions. I'm curious how the current market behavior feeds into that broader theory. Yeah. I mean, I view it as we're in that process. You know, we're so spoiled because we haven't had big pullbacks. We're, you know, we're getting these two, three, four, five percent pullbacks. And those seem now to be big pullbacks or not. And, you know, historically, we just haven't had this kind of a straight up market.

Now, if we get a four or five percent correction, people are saying, what's wrong with the market? I mean, this is just the market refreshes itself, you know, to stir set process. And each time it pulls back, it causes a sentiment, vericentment to increase. Obviously, investors act on that sentiment a lot of the time. So that means they're getting more defensive, they're raising more cash. It's rebuilding the skepticism that you need to keep going higher. What you have to worry about is when sentiment gets so bullish that everybody's in agreement that this thing's going so much higher. That means they've acted on that and you're already at the top. So that's coming, but we're not there all now. Leads to an interesting follow on based on your comment around perception around pullbacks and like severity. What I find really interesting is on some of these exactly to your point, lighter pullbacks, we're actually seeing the VIX spike not crazily, but pretty meaningfully. And what does that mean to you then? Is it like just broader institutional support of that theory where we've become so complacent where a 4 5 pullback is seen as VIX needs to",

Is it like just broader institutional support of that theory where we've become so complacent where a 4 5 pullback is seen as VIX needs to go to 25 now because of this small pullback, which we typically wouldn't necessarily see to that degree. Yeah, I can't remember when that last spike was where the VIX went up above 30, I think, or got to 30. Yeah, it looks like that happened on the 18th of December and the VIX hit a high of 2832. And then the last time it was above 30 was during that August pullback where everything kind of rolled over a little bit. Yeah, the August one, for sure, was people panicked and that was people were so sure that we were heading straight down. They had a lot of estimates of big drops. It thought that was just the start of something much bigger. So that was a high of, sorry, I was just going to throw out their VIX hit a high of 65. Yeah, yeah.

And I can't remember what the news event was. Do you remember I can't it's funny. Yeah, that's what there had to be something there. Yeah, it may have been, it may have been the pop in interest rates. Because interest rates had gone up from 360 up to three to, yeah, to four 20 or 430 and then started to come back down maybe even up to four 40 started to come back down. And then I think we might have gotten a bad CPI report. Or, yeah, that's what I think it was. It was inflation. And that spooked everybody and yields went from three, you know, they had come back down from three 40 to I think three 20. Next thing you know, they were at 360 on their way to three 80, 10 year.

I was just like the market is crashing on him essentially saying the same thing. Yeah, it was, you know, he's basically telling you we cut rates in September. We cut again in November and December. And we may have to sit for a little while and wait for the data that tells what to do next. I thought we knew that going in. Why is everybody panicking? But that was the story. So again, there's a case where right around there going into that, you had was one people were giving you their year in 2025 numbers. You know, the striges on the street are telling you about the next year and starting to give you the year end numbers. And so they had they had raised all their numbers right before that.

You know, and and that inflation was ticking up. So even though none of that concerned me, it's your concern the street leads to a follow on. This is one that continues to confound me. I just wrapped up my 18th year of trading, which I mentioned to you because it's funnier than anything. You've been in markets more than double that. But I find it so interesting because my my general expectation is that institutions are pretty smart. They probably have people that are close to Powell. In some capacity, you know, they're probably hearing things being talked about here and there not to go so far as insider information necessarily, but probably not off the table.

You can probably understand this even better than I can being a trader. It's all about positioning. In short term sentiment. In short term positioning too. I mean, they're they're going in with and traders are by definition more fickle, right? You know, they're they can have one opinion one day and a totally different opinion next day, whereas my opinions haven't changed much in two years, you know, so or maybe five years. But so it's a lot of it is they're looking they're parsing every word. They're looking at everything for any potential change and whether any of them want to admit it or not, they're driven by the tape. So if he had said the same thing and the tape had gone the other way, that wouldn't have been anything they would look at it. It's the combination of their positioning and what then soon begins to happen at the margin. If it starts, then they say, Oh, yeah, his rhetoric seemingly is indicating we might be done with cuts",

I got to get out, you know, and and then once you drove yield so fast, it's booked the market. I see. Interesting. Now, another thing I noticed with like near term positioning to to follow along on that and continue putting you out of your comfort zone talking about short term stuff. I find it so interesting that it seems like the market is digesting any sort of inflation level data. And it seems like it's like high-percentive to the downside. But it's not really showing that to the upside, right? Like when we got the the slightly lighter CPI yesterday, the market went up, but it's not like flying up. Whereas it seems like if that came in a little hot, the probability of my mind is that the market was probably going to show up a pretty big hand to the downside. So what do you think about like that general function right now as it sits? Yeah, that's good insight because I do think it's indicative of the nervousness that's still built into this market. It confirms for me. It's certainly not, you know, it's not where I spend most of my, I",

Because typically, when I think of the, the actual melt up portion of this where things start to get more parabolic in nature at some point, I continue to go back to like, I'm curious what the catalyst then would be. And it looks like the next Fed rate cut isn't really priced in until the summer. It's like June, and it's only like just over 50. So it's real, real light at this point. So then I'm thinking that's coming up, but not until summer. So then does that impact the timeline that you would expect for this melt up? Or is there another catalyst that could contribute here? Could be in other cows, but I don't even think it's another catalyst. I think that's, that's, that's the narrative today that can change to the narrative that causes us to go. In other words, if people are, if people are now convinced that there's no cuts coming for six months.

Again, I don't know this, but I saw something today where PC, PCE and people can take CPI, PPI, I don't do it. But somebody can just claim they can pretty much give you what PCE will be.

I don't worry about that, but it is, it is part of measuring a narrative, which, you know, where it's a narrative, two cuts of the four, whatever, but, but personally, I think the bigger story is going to be that this economy is going to slow faster than people expect. Maybe, maybe, maybe in recession much sooner than people expect. And then from there, you know, see even worse thing from that. And, and the inflation is actually, we may be finally getting to the point where, because shelter was a, a net, help this, this time around in terms of inflation lower, I think came in below expectations.

I have said for a long time, I think the much more likely way we get to a top is weakness in the economy, not strength. You know, I think, I think the likelihood is that the the narrative that we have as we move to the top is going to be weak software economy. I don't, I don't mean it's bust, but software economy, maybe even recession nearby, lower inflation and fed ease. You know, fed is back on the ease story.

And this is as long as I filed the Fed, which is 50 years, that has been part of how Wall Street sees things. True ease is the money supply is the fed's balance sheet. The fed's been tightening. Even now, they've been tricking in the balance sheet. So, you know, true ease is when they're printing money, when they're expanding their balance sheet again, we're not, we're not seeing that at all. So the fed is still tight and tightening. And yes, rates have come down, but that's not ease, although, you know, in Wall Street language it's ease, but it's really, the rates are following the market down. What do you make of the relationship still between small cap and large cap? I thought it was noteworthy seeing the Russell contract as heavily as it did in December. And as compared to things like large cap, which has started at least a little bit, maybe it's just a relief rally because it still looks like it's in a downtrend again from a trader's perspective.

Is that the main thing that you would see for the Russell specifically? Or does it follow the broader narrative that you're talking about before? Yeah, it's basically for the whole market. I think I think you're going to have lower interest rates, weaker dollar. And of course, the Russell is also more financials. I think they will benefit from all of that. And so we'll domestic and I talk less about it because it's not really the macro story, but having Trump come in as of next Monday and pushing a pro capitalists, pro US policy is very much very much favors the Russell. I see. Literally a beautiful segue too. So we saw an initial rally, obviously, when Trump won the election itself. Do you think that there's going to be a sympathetic follow-up through when he actually takes office?

So I think you had that initials per right after the election when he won and then really in a little bit more into December, but then after that it's been all negative. So not because of him so much, but more focus on, well, there is a narrative that has been a negative narrative for Trump and that regarding Trump. That was the idea that tariffs are inflationary. The idea that his policies, CBO and various Wall Street economists are all pushing this idea that he, you know, relevant happened before the election or against it back then, but that his policies were more inflationary and would cause higher deficits than Kamala's would and certainly more in Biden's. And I disagree with all of that. The problem is that most of those that score these policies hate supply side economics don't believe in supply side economics.

Do all of this stuff in a static model, meaning they don't give you any credit for lower tax rates leading to higher growth and higher growth leading to higher tax revenues. It's been proven. It was proven in the Reagan tax cuts. It was proven in the first Trump tax cuts. When you do large tax cuts across the board like they did, it does boost the economy. All things being equal. The problem is, you know, at the end of the Trump administration, all things were equal. We had a pandemic. And so, you know, we had the early stages of having the prime pump and push all kinds of new fiscal money out the door. So it kind of short circuited what would have been growing revenues and lower spending or not, you know, not bigger spending. But the problem in deficits is spending. Our problem is not tax cuts. If you cut taxes, you're going to get higher revenues. And so, but partially because they don't believe in them, partially because they don't, you know, partially because I think a lot of these people scoring have TDS. You know, I think the combination of those two things, you end up with assumptions that are, I think, very faulty. And so my belief is, is policies will not lead to higher inflation,",

That all being said, you know, my forecast, which is that we are going to have much higher inflation after the bust because of the, you know, the massive money that gets put into the system, not just here, but around the globe. But that's not because of Trump policy. So, so the initial response, I think, once you get selected, is that you are going to get another, you know, big boost to the market. Do you think the conversations he's having around increasing tariffs with big trade partners like Canada, Mexico, also him trying to increase just domestic production because you know all this way better than I do. But my expectation of some of those policies, depending on how they're implemented, in my mind, I was expecting short term pain that might lead to longer term relief. But it sounds like you're thinking when you're talking about not being super inflationary. What, what timeframe is, are you using for that? And then do you see any short term issues based on some of those policies that would then alleviate longer term? Do you think that there would be essentially none right",

So, so I have to talk about reality versus, you know, what, what I think will happen in the real world versus what I think the narrative is going to be. So in other words, under my bust forecast, it's not a given, it's my forecast, right? Where I say we're going to have the biggest downturn in the post-war or two era, we're going to have the biggest financial crisis, maybe ever, globally. And leading to maybe 20 trillion in Fed expansion. And likewise, proportionally around the world, that jump starts in inflation cycle like no other. You know, we'll see a, we'll see 25 in my opinion, I've said this to you before, we'll see 25 inflation by early next decade if I'm right about that. So I'm not saying Trump isn't going to be living, you know, that we're not going to be seeing inflation in the balance of this decade. I think we're going to see deflation first. And the response to that deflation is going to cause inflation. But that's, that's a macro story that that's a thing to do with Trump's policies. So, and we don't know that that's",

So they're not going to be, they're not going to be focused on, because it won't even be evident at that time, they're not going to be focused on a global bus and a response to the bus is going to be a stationary.

And as I say, the reason I'm going for a bus is because we've got massive leverage on that system, much bigger than 2008-09. That's really the story of why it turns a recession, you know, an ordinary recession, it's simply worse. But the first step is to get into that recession. I see.

So let's start with oil. Oil's had this run from, you know, the mid-60s to the high-70s and the less, I don't know what, a couple months. I think that run should be over or very close to over. It ticked down today, but who knows. I'm still in the belief that we're heading for 60. It's not unusual to have a run. You know, we came down from 130 back in 22, came all the way down to the 60s and then back up into the 80s, mid-80s, I think. And then back down to the mid-60s again and now up to the high-70s, I think it's part of that stair step, you know, it plays out over many months, but it's what I think is going on. I think the next step is another run down to even lower lows than the mid-60s. So probably, you know, 60 or high-50s and that coincides with the economy getting softer as we move",

Again, the next set of data points I'm not trying to tell you happens in the next two weeks, you know, or three weeks or four weeks, but over the course of this first half of this year, I think we're going to see a softer economy lower demand. And of course, where it was, Germany's in negative GDP now, China's in deflation now. So you're going to see where it went demand for oil, I think, continues to slip. At the same time, Trump's coming in and talking about, you know, drill-by-be drill right from day one. So how fast that all plays out, I think it's in the narrative right away, that oil supply is going up and my belief is oil demand is coming, I'm going to continue to soften that leads to weaker prices. So that's what I think the next several months is. And then I've said in the bus, if I'm right, the bus happens later this year in the bus next, but oiled with a 30. So I think we've pretty much seen the high water mark or close to the high water mark in oil. You know, watch it next",

And I think it just begins a downtrend from there. Before we go into metals for the oil component just at a curiosity, do you think softening demand would then lead to production slowing? Or do you think that we would start storing, I'm just wondering how those two different things come together? Well, yeah, my guess is, and I don't know this obviously, but my guess is Trump's other mind to get oil up, right? He's not saying, he's not trying to predict the oil price in the next six months. He's just looking and saying, yeah, if I were president the last four years, we would have had even more supply and we got to get oil up. And he's focused really on us being totally independent of supply coming in from our adversaries or anybody that we are self-sufficient in oil. So he's looking at it as lower oil prices, lower gasping prices, helps the economy, helps the consumer. Higher oil production helps Pennsylvania helps oil companies, etc. So I think he's not going to be all focused on what's",

So so I think the likelihood is at least for the next several months, he's going to be encouraging more drilling. Now what the oil companies do in terms of their focus, they may be a little more focused on, you know, we want to hold back some of that supply because, you know, the market's weakening. So it's not, you know, his policy may not go one-for-one right into a big increase in supply because it's got to be done by the companies themselves. But I think in general, the narrative of the next six months is going to be towards higher supply or towards, you know, more drilling. I see, got it. Okay, cool.

I mean, gold is coming out of a consolidation of the last several months where if you look, particularly if you're looking at them monthly, you know, kind of came into a wedge, technically, and it's breaking out of that wedge, as we speak. So we're not far from highs. I think we'll push through the old high, you know, last year. And, you know, my target is 3,400. And I think I'm very comfortable with 3,400. If it exceeds 3,400, it won't surprise me. And that's, again, first half of this year, probably, could spill over from there. But I think it's most of its first half. Silver has been the laggard of the two, particularly the miners of silver. But I think silver is also showing it's coming out of consolidation. You know, it got up to 35 and a half. I think it's, you know, run early on last year, whatever towards the end of last year. And it's corrected down to, you know, bulk up just below 30.

But my guess is it's the next month. And on its way to the mid 40s. And then from the mid 40s, I have a target 75. So again, it's coming from farther back. So it might take longer in terms of it may take more than six months, but it can also get going fast. It could be, most of them could happen in the next six months. So that's a hell of a move. If we go from 30 here, or 3031 here to 75, and that's kind of what I expect. By the way, the gold silver ratio, which had rolled over last year because silver did pretty well for a while. And gold that, you know, could tolerate some of their run. Silver just goes faster when it goes. It's percentage wise, most faster. So in the bull run, we had brought the gold silver ratio down from 80 or 85, 90. I don't remember where it topped out there.

So what that means is as that ratio drops that favor silver, means silver is up performing gold. And that's exactly what you get in bull markets in the metals.

You know, they look like they're lifting out of a consolidation and they stop it correct again. And I think that's just discouraged the miner investors. And so they're more shown the investors.

Yeah, I'm not saying we didn't lose some investors that used to be traditional metals investors to Bitcoin. I'm sure there are people think it's, you know, it's digital gold or whatever. Right. So I'm not saying that hasn't happened at the micro level on a macro basis. What we're seeing in gold and silver is gold and silver's own problems, you know, or particularly silver own problems. It's not. I think Bitcoin has little to do with any of it. And I'm not going to hold back gold and silver now or post bust. You know, my target on gold is 20,000 by early next decade. My target on silver is 500. So clearly I'm not thinking Bitcoin's an issue. And I don't know what Bitcoin isn't that. You know, maybe it flies to or maybe it doesn't go. I, you know, it could",

I, you know, it could be, you know, I have no opinion of what Bitcoin's going to look like after the bust or frankly, it's got to prove itself in the bus before you kind of have any idea what's going to look like what it does. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. One last question before I let you run. The when I think about a lot of the technology that's coming out, there's expansion of artificial intelligence, general robotics, we're now starting to talk about quantum computing, although that still seems like it's a bit of a ways done done the path here. Do you think from a commodities, metals, perspective that there could be some sort of larger production of some of the materials that ultimately feed into those broader systems? So things like lithium, for example, kind of going to like the battery side of things, just thinking that from a commodities perspective, if there's going to be this really big technological revolution, it needs to be supported by, you know, an underlying hardware infrastructure of some sort. Do you see any specific commodities, anything like that that is more friendly, more likely poised to benefit from that movement? Yeah, for sure. I think",

Do you see any specific commodities, anything like that that is more friendly, more likely poised to benefit from that movement? Yeah, for sure. I think a silver is a good one that being solder obviously in the EV, in solar panels, in lots of technology areas, it's increasing the need for silver and the demand for silver. So I think yes, lithium, silver, some of those metals are going to see increase demand because of technology. And we're going to obviously see increased power needs because of technology. So, you know, benefits oil later on down the road. So yeah, I think for sure, on the other hand, what I would say, this isn't really a question, but post-bust, if the environment is what I think it's going to be, which is unlike the last 42 years where interest rates ratchet it down from 15 or 20 down to almost zero, the next cycle post-bust, they're going to ratchet up from zero to 20 higher. That is not an environment for growth stocks. So there will be growth stocks that can outpace that kind of move in interest rates and the effect has on PE multiples, etc. There'll be things probably in the AI field and maybe quantum physics, etc. But generally, whereas growth was the name of the game for many, you know, for",

It's going to be commodities because there's going to be a real scarcity, partly for what you just asked about, you know, that feeds into that same thing where demand is going to far outstrip supply. And there's only one way for prices to go if demand outstrip supply by the amount it's going to, and that's straight up. Got it. Okay. One last question I promised I lied to you before. I was just thinking about the scissors talking. Nuclear energy. Do you think that that starts to take a larger role in providing energy at this point? Do you think that there's a feeder opportunity there? I think so. I mean, you definitely have improved the technology and they've rethought it. So it's no longer these greenfield plants that take 15 years in the planning. And so the supply comes online 20 years from now or 18 years from now. And it's not realistic. So now you have these smaller nuclear plants that can be built pretty quickly and you know, don't have to cross so many regulatory hurdles. And",

So for sure, we're going to have a shortage of energy. There's no question. That's just like commodities. Energy is going to be a commodity that demands far outstripping supply. You know, we've constrained supply in all those areas in energy and all our commodities. And then all of a sudden you have this huge, massive fiscal is in monetary pump stimulus. 20 trillion from our fed, something 15 or 20 trillion from our government in terms of new fiscal all that. And the same thing going around around the world, you're just going to have this huge spike in demand for things. You know, here it's going to be the story's going to be we're reshoring, we're building a plan equipment. You know, we're bringing our capacity back on shore. And that demands a lot of commodities elsewhere. There's going to be stories around the world. Why? Why? There's a need for all these resources. But the story is that there's going to be this massive demand. And energy is definitely one of them. You know, electricity is definitely one of them. So I think, and I also think the next four",

This is not going to be windmills. You know, it's not going to be, you know, some solar, it's not that those things are going away. But I think Trump is going to be much more about, yeah, we need to go where we can get the biggest bang for our buck and where it makes much more sense economically. And that's nuclear. As well as you're going to continue to see fossil fuels. And they're not going away. They're going the other way. I think the next, you know, between now and the end of the decade, fossil fuels are going to be expanding big time, not shrinking. Makes it fun of sense. If we had a different president, and that wouldn't be the story, but under Trump, that's where we're headed.
