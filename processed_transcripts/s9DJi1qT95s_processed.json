    "text": "What's up outliers? Quick GameStop update as promised I'm on a weekly cadence now. We'll take a look at this. And really the main thing I want to talk about today is where GameStop currently sits. And it's because from a technical perspective, it's at a very interesting level. As you can tell, all of these lines have been on the chart. You've seen them before. So I want to talk about how prices reacting to these different thresholds and what we might expect. But before that, as per usual, let's get a quick recap from the Saturday stream. In case you weren't able to make it. And I actually want to talk about this specifically because we also hit a landmark this last Saturday. So we had episode 31, that is 31 Saturdays in a row where I've been spending at least an hour upwards of two and a half hours live streaming with you all looking at the GameStop saga. And we are this wrapped up part 13 of reviewing the top theories and due diligence that exists. Now we've been going through the DD library for this 13 part sub series. And we actually just wrapped up the diamond handbook. It's over 800 pages of due diligence that's been consolidated down along with AMAs and things like that. So I wanted to take a second and actually won just share that fact with you because that's crazy to me. That's really interesting that we looked at that",

So I wanted to take a second and actually won just share that fact with you because that's crazy to me. That's really interesting that we looked at that much information together is all of you know, hopefully by now, my goal is not to spread hype or fudge genuinely. I am just curious about the world around me. I like learning things. I like exploring. So that means I don't really take what people say as law. I like to look at source documents and actually see the things for myself. And that's what we've been doing here is having a chance to actually look at things with our own eyes versus hearing somebody say something about something and then thinking that we know about that topic, which typically might be partial truths. I like to know the details. So I want to summarize a couple of the key themes that I came across as I was doing the series. The first theme is that the DD library has a glorious mix of varying levels of due diligence. There are a lot of things in there that I would objectively summarize as you know, people that are trying, but not really anything you can objectively point at and say we found something objective here. Like a lot of it is people sharing their opinions, their thoughts and things",

That's actually a really important process in our path to exploring things as to postulate ideas. So just want to be clear, I'm not talking bad against that. There's just a lot of that in there. And then there's actually the section of DD that I have to be honest, I am most interested in. And there are pieces in there that are really, really high quality research that source documents are cited. And there are a lot of dots being connected. Those are my favorites because it removes the inobjectiveness of our opinions. And we're looking at objective facts reality as it sits. And there are a number of issues that were raised that I saw in the DD library that I think are worth recapping for everybody. And I want to be clear, none of this I don't think is going to be new news to you. I think it's going to be mostly recapping. But the first thing is the key issues that we came across in the DD library, things like naked shorting, things like FTDs, things like conflicts of interest, there are varying degrees of all of those.",

And also I should say not in transparent lack of transparent markets and reporting, that's a big one actually, that would be the fourth one I would list. And of those things, something that really stuck out to me that is partially disheartening, but also partially not shocking is a lot of the issues that the DD library, specifically the diamond handbook that was going back to explore, they a lot of these were written back in 2021 and they're citing documents from, you know, the prior decade, almost two decades before that. There was a video that we came across that was talking about Wall Street and a lot of the issues with Wall Street. And there was a section in there with Dr. Susan Trimbath. And she's talking about naked shorting. The sad part about this is that part of the video was shot in like the early 2000s. She was talking about something that she was in the video, citing something back like 10 years. So that takes us back to 1990s into the 2000s as different versions of these videos were made, talking about naked shorting. And it's still a conversation point. It's still a thing",

The reason why that's so important to identify is because that tells us very clearly with the powers that be the various conflicts of interest that exist and the current incentive structure. There is a lack of incentive to actually institute change. And it's important remember that because the only way then to eventually make that happen is by maintaining steady pressure on the issue, which the GameStop community has done incredible job doing to be completely honest because it's been a long time. And the same drum continues to be beat. Now to highlight one of these conflicts of interest, we have our fan favorite, which the purple here looks dashing. But Janet Yellen is you guys know she was the Federal Reserve Chair. And she disclosed a list of more than 50 paid speaking events. This is all old news, by the way. But I want you to look at the firms that she's speaking at. Oldman Sachs, Barclays, Citadel. There's a lot of these places that people who are in government positions. And I also want to be clear, this is for the Federal Reserve, right? Like this isn't the SEC. But what I'm highlighting is",

But what I'm highlighting is I imagine pretty much everybody in those kinds of government positions has this to deal with because here's the reality. You have people that spend their entire career building up their their proficiency. Then they go into government. She didn't make bad money in government. But let's also be realistic. You don't make great money in government. Most people that are going into government to go in to try and build a report. They try to build experience a resume that then is in demand by the civilian slash corporate world afterwards. People in the military do this too. And the reason is because you spend your entire career building skills and then you work in a place like the government that doesn't fully reward them again. I had not seen that they get paid terribly. But if you're looking at the kind of caliber of people that are rising to these roles, they're exceedingly smart. These are the kind of people that would be making a killing in the civilian world. So they're in these positions. And then they're making decisions based on what they are trying to do.

The fact that they're going to say, I'm going to go work in government for a bit. I'm not going to make what I'm worth at this point. But I can supplement that by going doing speaking engagement, that Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Citadel, and so on and so forth. So then I can supplement essentially what I'm trying to make. This is the conflict of interest. Because if I'm the Federal Reserve Chair and again, I'm not getting paid what I think I'm worth. And I can go speak to Citadel and make 292,500 from a single speech. That's a lot of money. So unless you come across people who are completely impervious to money, which most of us aren't. Let's keep it real. If a lot of us were in the same scenario, it would be a tough trade-off. And who knows what decisions we all would make. We don't know. We're not in the position. So I'm not sitting here judging her or anybody else directly. I'm simply talking about the facts and the reality as it is. The fact is this being part of this absolutely would create a conflict",

Because then when you're in these kinds of positions, the things you do are slightly slightly integrated thinking of what impact might it have on my ability to do these things for these kinds of people. So the takeaway here is that not that the system is so fully corrupt and nothing can be done, right? That is that getting to that level of dismay is always sad. Because then it's essentially just throwing our hands up and quitting. And I don't really believe in that. But there is a reality that this kind of thing is going to take a while. And it's going to continue taking a while. Now, Reg show just got an update that's actually kind of cool. That's going to start requiring funds that are over, I think it was 100 million. I forgot the exact amount to start reporting their shorts. So things like that, I think are good. It's slow.

So all of that came really to the forefront of this whole thing. So that stuff aside, we have now the rest of the DD library to go through, which I'm really, really stoked to do. But there's so much more to explore because the story continues to unfold. One of the things is the change for Cohen shares from RC ventures to his personal name. And we spent a while hypothesizing about that. We even recruited chat GPT to help us war game and think of different scenarios. Why this might happen? Why this might make sense. So there's a lot to unravel here and it continues to be interesting to me. So all of that aside, I want to take a quick look at GameStop where we sit today because I do think we're at a very important level and I mentioned this a couple times. So when we see stocks downtrend like this, and when we see them breaking out of the downtrends like this here, this initial downtrend that you can see drawn, it's really important what it does in this next section.

And unfortunately, a lot of this coalesced with the terror of conversation that was happening on Friday, then the subsequent gap down that happened on the third. So right now, GameStop seems to be following a lot of the broader market beta. But we are now at what I consider to be a essentially critical level. The reason why I think this 20 and a half, 25 and a half level is so critical is because below this, there has been very few transactions. That means not a lot of people are transacting in GameStop at these prices until you get all the way down here to 2226. So for me, I also remember have that coverage strangle position at an options trade that I've been sharing with you in GameStop. So this also matters to me because again, I'm a trader. So I already told you I unwound some of the shares not too long ago. And the reason for unwinding some of the shares was because for a trader lens, I can't make money holding stock if it's going down. That's one of the big things, right? And I know that that's like, well, yeah, no shit Sherlock. But the reason why that matters is because it informs short term positioning. So for me,",

So for me, if we start to see meaningful breaking down below this level, I probably will lighten up even more shares and continue to trade at via cash secure puts to take advantage of the downside volatility. The volatility in here has been absolutely massive. Take a look at the yellow line here and take a look at the gap that you see between the yellow line and the gray line. That's representing historic variance risk premiums, which are still very significant. So I took a stroll through the option chain as per usual to see if anything stuck out to me. So the first thing we can take a look at together is literally just to see what the overall tenor is of movement. And it's lightning up. Everything that I see here is very, very much lightning up. So what I mean by that is if you take a look at the overall call volume and put volume, it's been contracting since essentially the end of last week. There was a slight uptick and then it rolled back over. So really, really light overall trading activity that we see in GameStop from an options perspective. I didn't see any big",

If we sort this by premium over the last week, the biggest raise for 36,000 and that's on the call side, which is good. But yeah, just really, really light. Now, if we take a look at the options chain itself, we can still see it's maintaining heavy call skew over the put side. And that continues to be an important data point because I monitored the relationship between here, which has been about steady. Ponds of calls traded today against the puts. So the activity on a daily basis still continues to be very, very call heavy. And it's not people just buying or selling. It's kind of like split, right? Because you can see 32 of the volume today was at the bid or below and 33 was at the offer or above. So these are people kind of doing both things.
