Yeah, absolutely. I know. Yeah, we've had a we've been on my podcast a couple times. We've had a couple conversations that we wish we had turned into a podcast. And so it's always good talking to you and talk about our approaches and this might be my first video podcast. So this will be interesting for me. Yeah, cool man. Glad to be here. You look great. And I always feel like I feel like I provide like a good benchmark, right? Like I'm the ugly friend. So I always make other people look better. Yeah, you're welcome. I'm doing. Okay, thanks. I always thought I had a face for radio, which is why my my shows always audio. Yeah, I mean, I don't disagree with you, but I definitely also have a worse face. So now, man, jokes aside, it's great to catch up. So I thought with you to kind of dive a little bit into your background and we'll get into more recent stuff. But I think it would be useful context for people that may not be familiar with who you are, what your background is,",

So from a background standpoint, I don't have any sort of financial background. How far do you want to go back? You want me to start wherever you started with derivatives? If that's rewound post. I'll go back a little bit further because so when I went to college here in Florida, I started out as a math major. And I ended up changing to education and taught like middle school, math, like algebra, that type of thing. And I did that for a few years. I was a musician. I was a percussionist and marching band type guy. I played drums at Disney around that time. And so this was this was the early 90s in Florida. And in case you didn't know, I think Orlando was like the rave capital of the world. So for a few years, I got into DJing and music and I had this drumming background. I ended up going back to school",

But they were kind of counting as a college and they were going to teach you all the other fancy strategies, but. But I think, you know, credit spreads is kind of what I sort of remember a lot about because they did a pretty good job of explaining in. And option terms, what, you know, what it is and, and you know, bearish neutral and you don't, you don't have to be all the way right. You just can't be really wrong and those, those type of things. And that kind of appealed me at the time. I think it appeals to a lot of beginners still because. Because it's, you know, a way to def, you know, it's defined risk, you know, exactly how much you can lose in case something goes wrong. But you don't always have to be 100 right. So that kind of stuck with me for a while. And then as I got more into technical analysis, I kind of threw the options out of was more. Not through the options job, but I, I focused less on the option and selection was more like, OK, I'm trading a 30 minute chart. I'm going to buy an option that's 30 days out and look for like swing trades and stuff. So. So yeah, I think, I think from that period",

Some of that makes sense. But it does. Yeah, well, I mean, to your point, if you're using something like a credit spread, you'll always see a better return on invested capital. And yeah, it's, yeah, your capital efficiencies is exactly as good. Yeah, yeah, it provides a little bit of a different, a little bit of a different risk profile. But they're, they're very, very capital efficient, obviously.

The one thing I like about the credit spreads is that they are capital efficient, and when you can increase your frequency with and continue a similar win rate risk reward, you can trade smaller and therefore more consistently. So that's kind of where I've ended up over the years and why I typically just trade SPX at this point. And two questions, the first follow up is in the early days, what was your original goal with trading, what were you trying to accomplish other than the fact make money, right, that's pretty clear, but beyond that, did you have any specific goals, like be we're trying to return a certain percent, were you trying to limit drawdown, how did that look?

Well I think you hit on a bunch of super important points though the first one. Is even though you didn't necessarily have the the road map you know on Friday that like Sunday i'm going to leave right the fact is as you still had put enough. For thought into building the origin of the plan that you had built a runway into skill set that you could reasonably lean on and it was time to activate that I again I just highlight that for other people because a lot of my audience they're used to my way of doing things hearing me talk about my way of doing things which is. Everything is very planned like essentially everything and I think it's really cool to hear so many elements of your story that stem from having a general plan but not necessarily you know the same approach that I technically take and it's still worked out well for you. So. The other thing that I want to highlight as I heard you kind of talking about that path though and the important point is that you would build enough of a skill set that you felt confident in making at least the crack at this.

You don't always win and there are periods of time where you either lose or maybe you don't have strategies for because the market's not doing what your normal strategy is. Or you know like like when we're talking the market sort of pulling back i'm not really doing a lot of trades right now because most of my strategies are kind of. Bullish things so i'm kind of on the sidelines and in a lot but i'm I think. um. It it it just goes back to you know risk reward and cash flow and you know zero dte was coming more in play at that time.

I don't look at IV I don't typically try to roll or I don't I don't sell Delta five anything I used to so what I've kind of gotten into is like a sort of a fixed risk reward of at the money stuff and it's either going to win or it's going to lose.

I had to adjust and roll because um because that's what the market was going straight up but I think um. My the strategies I end up focusing on I think fallen line with what the market typically does and typically the market goes up over time and some people call it positive drift or whatever and so one thing I like to tell people is I trade a lot of put credits spreads mainly because the market tends to go up the market goes up slower than it goes down.

    "text": "it. I like just fascinated by the math part and just markets in general. So if you know the whole finance piece is definitely interesting and how learning about how the world works. I think that is what kept me interested because you're like oh whether you win or lose in the market did something crazy. You're like well why would the market go up if there's bad economic reports and then you realize oh well the Fed prints money and that's like I never knew anything like I don't have any finance to go. I've just kind of learned this stuff over the years. And so you know you just have to have an interest and and be persistent with something and what I normally would tell someone the beginning is. Just if you're going to trade options. Find one thing one ticker maybe two or three you know one option structure maybe that's credit spreads or condors or whatever. eight and just and just yeah just one set up I think starting with verticals is best because it's the low lower risk and. And it kind of makes sense you can you can you know trade it directionally and then you can flip you know you do a verticals debit spread. And it's kind of a directional you buy a call spread and you want to go up and then you eventually get to you flip that to a credit spread where you just don't want it to",

And it's kind of a directional you buy a call spread and you want to go up and then you eventually get to you flip that to a credit spread where you just don't want it to go down kind of thing. And I think timeframe is it is important that you should try to focus on one timeframe so if you're working a day job you probably want to watch the daily chart maybe a four hour chart but don't come up with some strategy on a five minute chart because you won't be able to execute that consistently. And then you're going to want to and you know at some point you have to say no i'm not going to take this trade and if you've sent if he's spent two hours in front of the computer. And you've and you've been able to say no i'm not going to take this trade that that that means you're good but most people. After two hours on the computer what will I got to do something and then they just take it or they they you know jump the gun or whatever. So I think your time frame is important and your duration so if you're I think most people probably end up in the tasty trade world of 30 to 45 days and I think that's a good place to start.

It's boring to put the trade on the exciting part is is this one going to work once it's on you know you don't know till after so but not doing anything about it. So yeah that's kind of where I do. Yeah that's awesome well I always tell people the exciting part is figuring out where you're going to spend all the money you make you know you can be excited somewhere else take the money and go go do go do something fun with it but.

Some of the other stuff that you've really developed maybe get into the details more on.
