Miramar is right down, not that close, but close enough. I go to the gym there sometimes. What are the other things? Lauren says, I'm still trying to figure it out. That's a fair response. Well, okay. Let's go to the tape and joking side. Let's actually take a look at some of the things people say other places. So let's grab Andy Dandy. Reddit, one of my favorite places for stuff like this. H says the anatomy of how options function and what mechanisms you want to profit from. Cream says, don't risk what you can't afford to lose. I actually like that one so far. None of these are what I would necessarily go with, but I think cream is very close. To where I probably would take it. Jordan says find the right fit options are not always it. That is good. That is good advice. I definitely think that that's something a lot of people skip over. So I'm glad that you mentioned that one as well. When I think about the most important concept for an options trader, the very first thing, because I get people to ask me all the time, a lot of my friends will ask me things like, Eric, how do I",

Can you teach me what you do? And as much as I would love to say yes to those kinds of people, I know the reality of things. And we're going to talk about what the reality of things actually is. And in order to do this whole thing, we need to again go back to what the point of the session today is. And the point of the session today is to give us an orientation on this world of trading and to give us a starting point to have a conversation. So let's do that. What I'm going to do is go on to theta gang and options. And we're literally just going to pull through. We're going to see I literally typed in the word start. And I'm just seeing what advice people give other people when they're looking to start trading options. I haven't looked at this yet. I just grabbed a bunch from right before we started.

So first comment here, bit advanced. That's fair. There's specific about selling options. Theta gang makes sense. It's fun. I like it. Understand what you're doing. Understanding the basics is important. Start off paper trading. That's good advice. Starting off paper trading. Trying to sell a call, sell a putt singular. Do it again. Something not too expensive from aggressive. Those four plays. So this, this feedback as I just eyeball over it. I think this is way too tactical of a starting point for somebody that says, I'm interested in getting started with investing. I think this is way too tactical. And we'll talk about why that is. Let's click another one. This one says, this is also Theta gang. We'll just poke through this new here. Haven't found any introductory material pins. Basics about options. They're looking to familiarize themselves with trading. This person says, read this book. I don't know what this is, but I'm not clicking it. Tasty trade option alpha. Great beginner material.

My guess is this person simply recommending it just to recommend it because they've heard other people recommend it. And they think that you are supposed to recommend it. Otherwise, you're not really an option trader. I, again, I like options pricing and volatility. It's a good book. But I don't inherently think that you have to have it. I think if you are a serious trader, like looking to do this professionally, you definitely should read it.

That's the effective foundation for a new options trader. It is nothing to do with options. It has everything to do with understanding this broader scope of the landscape we play in. And we'll talk more about that in a second. One of the things I will say I have changed my mind on is the courses thing. I still have not taken one. I've taken free ones through MIT open course, where in places like that. But one of my friends, Benjamin, from the Benjamin YouTube channel, he and I keep in touch. And I always told him that the courses are kind of bullshit. And he expressed a few courses that he's taken that he's actually gotten significant value out of. So my opinion on it is changing to the degree that I can absolutely see value in a good course emphasis on good course. I think the overwhelming majority of courses that exist are straight trash. And I think that for anybody that's a new option trader, you don't need to pay for a course. You can literally get a good course through MIT open course, where for free.

But when I was talking to Benjamin about it, I understood his perspective and I can adopt that as part of my paradigm now.

Like you can start with 0 in paper trade. So I don't really care about the dollar amount. I do still think that the more money you can start with provided that you have a good foundation, the safer you actually can be because your portfolio isn't inherently in a compromised position. But starting with more money is risky because a lot of people start before they're ready and blow up their money. So by starting with a smaller amount of money, you really manage your maximum drawdown potential. So it's kind of pick your poison in that sense. I actually think starting with more capital, but after a longer period, paper trading is probably slightly more efficacious than this. A couple more. 50,000 savings start trading options safely. I don't want to use all 50 for options, which strategy is better for safe trades. Again, by the phrasing of this, this person needs the paper trade. They're not even ready to start trading for a quote unquote safe trade. So I want to target average to return 2 return on risk monthly. That's actually a good caveat. I like that they said 2",

    "text": "trades. Again, by the phrasing of this, this person needs the paper trade. They're not even ready to start trading for a quote unquote safe trade. So I want to target average to return 2 return on risk monthly. That's actually a good caveat. I like that they said 2 return on risk because that's actually way more achievable, especially for a new trader. 2 return on your risk is not crazy for a new trader to be returning 2 on the portfolio every month. They'd still doable, but for a new trader's probably not going to happen. But for return on risk, it's much more doable. But let's see, there's no such thing as safe options. I actually disagree with that. I think there absolutely are. Getting 2 is very, very unachievable in my opinion. If it was all hedge fund managers would be doing it, these are the worst comparisons on earth. So this is again, somebody that knows a little bit, but really is missing a lot. The concept of if it was all hedge fund managers would be doing it is kind of silly. And it's just because I agree with their broader point of returning 2 and safely, depending on what safely means, they don't really go along with one another. However, this they're talking about 2 compounded month over month. And the compounding calculation, I actually like that. But the issue is they're applying a lot of like bullshit interpolation.

And the compounding calculation, I actually like that. But the issue is they're applying a lot of like bullshit interpolation. This is one thing I've learned from just interacting online is everybody is lazy as an interactor. They lazily express their ideas strictly from their own paradigm without taking any time to consider what the other people might read. And then when we're reading other people's stuff, we then lazily interpolate it in our own paradigm without taking the time to understand where the other person is coming from. Why do I say that here? This says, safely, this person is now drawing safely equals risk free. They didn't say without risk. They said safely. They're two different things. But this person just kind of like reading what they want. The other thing that they're reading is 2 compounded on the portfolio. The point is this is the exact kind of advice. This is the common shit people are going to see when they're trying to figure out where to start. This is if you could start over what you would what would you do different buying options sold them? I don't hate that. That one's okay. Allocation 5 of my account on any single trade. I don't like that advice. Work on trading completely divorce from emotion as a priority from day one.",

These still aren't really what matters for a new option straighter in my opinion. This is about specific risk management protocols for a specific strategy. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but it's very specific. The idea of being completely divorced from emotion is bullshit. You cannot be. So this immediately is giving somebody a task that is quite literally unachievable. You cannot be completely divorced from emotion. What your job is as a trader and this is something we spend a lot of time in the military working on is managing emotions. That's not suppressing. That's not ignoring. That's not pretending it doesn't exist. That's not divorcing from them. It's understanding them. And then when they come managing them, mitigating them, that's a completely different thing. The reason why this is the wrong scenario is because let's say you actually follow this advice and then you got emotional during a trade. You notice some sort of emotionality. Then you sit there and you start saying to yourself things like, well, fuck, I can't get rid of this emotion. I'm supposed to be a robot. I'm supposed",

Listen to everyone on here that says, start with long-term stocks. Open a paper-training account and use that to learn options. That's pretty fucking solid, be honest. When you say, fuck all that good advice, I'm going to trade options anyway. That's fucking accurate. Start by selling options, not buying them. I don't love that. Learn basic credit and put spreads. Call credit spreads, iron condors. Don't get greedy. 4 return per week would be great. What the fuck? We've gone off the rails. We've gone entirely off the rails.

And I noticed that a lot, especially with coaching clients and stuff like that, where people feel like they're far behind. And then they're trying to do stuff quickly to get caught back up. That's a terrible mentality to approach the world of trading from, which we're actually going to talk a little bit more about mentality. But to summarize all of what we looked at, this is what people are receiving from other people when they're asking the question of effectively, how should I start? How should I start trading? And what should I do? What should I do to start with? And again, it's a mixed bag, but I would say on balance, it's not really great here. And the reason is because a lot of these kinds of people that are giving this advice, they are the group that typically are at a point where they should be focusing more on learning themselves versus trying to instruct and teach other people.

I don't, I think that's don't even start by even worrying about options as somebody already directly pointed out in the chat, which I do agree with, if you're at that point in the stages, start thinking about stuff like profit mechanisms before you even concern yourself with what option strategy, whether I buy or sell. It's a little too off kilter for the beginning because again, you have to remember by even starting this, we're skipping some really, really important stuff, which we're going to talk about. So the first thing here is let's talk about the landscape of trading. The landscape of financial markets in general, let's say, is that they're highly complex, super competitive.

You're now a money manager, which is always interesting to me, because if I am sick, I definitely do my best to do my own research. But then I typically try to find somebody that is more knowledgeable than I am to then figure out what's actually wrong with me and maybe what I should be doing. It's the same thing what happened with my hernated disc. I literally flew out to Florida across the fucking country to go see somebody that I respected and think is a better information source on that injury. So the openness becomes a lot of people's downfalls, because there really isn't a lot of structure out there. So it is something to pay attention to. And it's something that you should really, really guard against. So what I mean by that is it's guarding against the impulse to just start doing shit by taking the time to take a step back and thinking through what you're trying to do and then building at least a rudimentary plan on how to get there is going to work a lot better.

But I want to linger on this point of the stock market landscape a little bit more. And specifically this one. So if we look across the different entities and markets and stuff, there's a lot of them. And this isn't even close to a comprehensive list. This is literally just to give an idea of what's out there. And one of the most important things to draw from as you look at this list of different participants and what the participants might be doing. That's where you are, by the way, in the little retail trader space here. And you can see how much money these other institutions put into doing to literally playing in the same landscape that we do. This is what happens when you go to the Olympics. What countries typically win the Olympics? It's kind of the fucking same ones. And if you look at the countries that tend to win the Olympics, they tend to be countries that have pretty good resourcing. So when you have these other countries that don't inherently have the same resourcing that are dealing with a smaller population, trying to put out their best and be as competitive as they can be, it's much more challenging.

But they're competing in the same landscape as these other entities that can spend tons of money on their Olympic programs. The analogy there is designed to try and give you a little bit of context about like we are the third world countries that are just eating rice because it's accessible. And we're running the de-Cathalon against other countries that have near unlimited resources. Just about give or take. So you start from a disadvantaged position and it's really, really important to know and accept that. So now let's take a look at the starting point for traders. Most traders come into the market desperate because they want to make money. They're hopeful that they might make money. They're misguided in what they've heard their friends say about that one stock that they bought in a doubled in two days. They don't know what they don't know. So they're ignorant. Like we all are when we start something new and most of us are impatient. Just like that example you saw in that how to start look at just 4 per week. Don't be greedy. Don't be greedy.

Greedy is bad but you know target something more humble like a 4 weekly return compounded. And the polarity of that is it's a 669 return. That's what that humble return of 4 per week is. So again we're starting this from the exact wrong spot. So let's take a break right now. And let's think about what we've covered so far from the broad landscape. We know that markets are complex. They're competitive and it's not the fast easy money that you thought it was going to be. We know that our starting point tends to be skewed from a bunch of different factors. So now the question becomes what is a good starting point? What is a good place to start? And this is again about options trading. But in this level of the conversation there's not a lot to talk about with respect to options. It really isn't because we are focusing on the foundation. What actually will create a sustainable thing? When I approach these conversations about trading you have to remember I have seen hundreds of people come and go. Hundreds. I mean thousands even. I don't pay attention quite that close to thousands but definitely hundreds that I've actually followed along with either known directly or slightly and directly. And",

I don't pay attention quite that close to thousands but definitely hundreds that I've actually followed along with either known directly or slightly and directly. And I've seen them come and go. And it's because of a lot of these other factors are all misplaced. The very first thing I think is a good starting point or an aspiring options trader is to talk about these expectations. What do you think is going to happen? For that person that says that they want to start trading safely. What's that mean? Maybe it's possible. Maybe it's not. But we need to understand the expectations. As we go through outlining our expectations as a new trader it's going to add a lot of clarity around what we're doing. What I mean really what we hope to do. So here is what I typically tell people with respect to how to set good expectations. One to two years, greater than zero. This equals rock star. Literally nobody likes hearing that because it is about as unsexy as it can get. Don't lose money. And you think like man two years what the fuck. I'm going to sit here and just try to not lose money for two years. Yeah. Definitely. And I always go back to the landscape. You are competing in the adult arena. There's no kiddie starting",

And I always go back to the landscape. You are competing in the adult arena. There's no kiddie starting place. There is no training wheels. You are out there in the open with everybody else. So again, going back to the Olympics conversation. You as a brand new trader just going out there trying to trade and get this really big return is literally the same as maybe a high school athlete attempting to compete directly in the Olympics. And winning. Some might be able to. There are physical phenomena like that every once in a great while. I'm not really sure how many high school people compete at like a high level and do well. I'm not that familiar with the Olympics. But I would imagine it would be infrequent. However, when we're first starting options trading, the reason why your expectations should be greater than zero is because this is not your focus in terms of how much money you're making. How much money you're making is a new options trader literally doesn't matter yet. It doesn't. It sounds crazy to say it, but it doesn't.

There's a bunch I can think of, but let's see what you have. And it can be really anything. Just think of the lens from a brand new options trader. What are some of the things that you have to pick up the Greeks? That's correct. We already saw on the other one, we need to pick up return potential.

I just didn't video on that. I'll throw a link into the notes for you guys. The reason why reading an options chain is funny because it's also timely is because one of the like reading an options chain was a 16-minute video that I made a 17 video that is designed to cut out all of the ancillary stuff and to give you a to Z everything to at least have a starting understanding.

The reason why I'm harping on that is because most content style videos like instructional and stuff like that are like eight minutes. But that's me cutting stuff out trying to make it digestible. So in order to read an options chain, you have to understand what a bit is, what an offer is. You have to know what a strike is. You have to know what an expiration is. You have to know what a midpoint is. You have to know what size is with respect to what's offered. You have to know what a premium is in how to read a premium. So if we're talking about something zooming into something like how to read a premium, this is now where we get into multipliers. You also need to be able to read things like delta. And I'm not talking at a mastery level. This is like a rudimentary understanding level. Delta, gamma, data, Vega. So as you click into something like delta, for example, we now understand that there's in the money out of the money, at the money. This is a completely foreign concept that you have to learn. And it's also inverse for calls and puts. We also know that delta has a different behavior over time. Because if we plot a time series, I guess delta can't be",

You have to get all of this other stuff down first before you're even remotely concerned with how much money you might make because you need to learn the tools of what you're doing.

By the way, it's a great genuinely is a great decision. But when you go to compete, your your target is to submit everybody to win all of your matches through via submission. Again, guess what probably ain't happening even remotely that if somebody that's new to jujitsu asks me like, Hey Eric, you recommend going to a competition early. Why is that? It's for the experience and it's to get it out of the way to get your first competition jitters out of the way doing it as a white belt. There's no expectations of you.

The reality of that white belt going to that jujitsu competition and subbing anybody let alone everybody is about zero.

They straight up don't matter. The results of your first few years of trading really don't matter because you are laying the groundwork for something that's way more important.

So if you have an action where you oversize the trade, undersize the trade, whatever it is, if you have a good process and you can ingest that outcome and objectively identify what the fuck happened, then you can make logical refinements that eventually will literally walk you onto target eventually. It's not about being able to trade like a robot. What ends up happening is if you can adopt this process driven mindset, you inherently stop caring about the outcome of any one individual trade. You now are already innately managing your emotions because you're not hyper focused on the outcome. You care more about your application of a process. So in my opinion, the most important thing for a new trader to keep in mind for laying a healthy foundation is setting good expectations. If you can set good expectations, it's literally what leads to the rest of this cycle. That eventually is what we expect to lead to the ultimate success of the trader. But the funny thing is if traders actually adopted this kind of thing, the entertaining part to me is all of the questions start to shed, meaning should I buy options or should I sell options? Should I go 60 days out? Should I go 40 days out? All of those questions start to go away. If you conduct an action, observe the outcome, analyze it",

This is actually like a really frustrating problem to try to deal with without a doubt. Like I truly truly believe that. So I don't envy the the difficulty that's baked into this because it is absolutely challenging. That being said, it is absolutely manageable. And it is something that you can work your way through. So I'm going to take a pause on all of that. And I just want to have a conversation with you guys. And I want to understand, especially for the newer traders on where are you right now in your options trading career, meaning do you feel like you're starting to get it? Are you brand new? And then the second question I want to know is what are you working on right now? My goal by asking this is literally to spend another 15 minutes with you guys talking about your specific scenario and trying to give you some direct feedback on based on where you're at and what you're trying to work on. If what you're working on may or may not make sense in some different ways to think about what you're working on. So now we have an open chat style conversation that is intent for the rest of the stream. Ayo, Cryptado, thank you so much for the dinner supply. We haven't figured out what we're doing for dinner",

Ayo, Cryptado, thank you so much for the dinner supply. We haven't figured out what we're doing for dinner yet. So if you guys have any recommendations, let me know. I don't really know what I'm feeling. I'll have to have to manifest off to think on it, figure out what what I literally have no idea what I would want for dinner. We'll see. So for those, especially for those newer traders, I definitely want to know what you're trying to work on right now so that literally we can talk about it. And hopefully see if we can have some breakthroughs. That's what I would love to do. Let me get caught up. Roryntady says, Charm, what the fuck is that? That's a great question. That's a fantastic question. So if we take a look at our handy bandied man, this, this PowerPoint thing is getting kind of crazy. Good lord this. So Charm, as you can tell, is a second order Greek. Essentially we refer to it as Delta decay. It's the rate of change of Delta due to the passage of time. If I were to think about some of the more important second order Greeks, really it's these three. Gamma, Charm and Vanna. Volga can matter if you're trading a lot of like really",

H says getting practice in adding options to my buy and hold portfolio. Lots of practicing, selling calls to get a hold of short premium strategies, moving to short strangles, been using a small percent for long calls. Trying to optimize credit received on the short trades versus the risk and learning to get better at managing feels like I do too much when I should do nothing and not enough when I should act. That's a fascinating, that's a fascinating analysis. There's a couple of things that I think of. The first question I would have for you H is what is the goal of adding options to your buy and hold portfolio? As you know, I am a really big fan of beginning with the end in mind. So by clearly defining what we're trying to achieve through in this case adding options to the buy and hold portfolio, we can actually gain a lot of clarity around what we're trying to do. Because I think there's quite a lot to pull away from there. So I'm happy to dive into that a little bit with you. But that's my first question for you.

Or you're trying to use options to amplify an existing buy and hold position. There's like a million things that you could conceivably do. I was literally talking with a friend earlier today about a position that they have. And they're holding shares of a stock that they really like. And they ended up selling a string of calls over the last few weeks. And it's like, they're all pretty deep in the money now. And I was asking how many calls did you sell against the shares? And they said, well, they're all covered because they were learning about a covered call. And then I asked, I was like, oh, interesting. I was like, so are you like trying to get rid of your shares? And they said, no, I don't want to get rid of my shares. So then I'm sitting there thinking to myself, that's kind of backwards.

So H says the goal is to reduce drawdown slash generate income on top of my holdings. The income being to size up and eventually leverage the position via timing, rotating in and out of options and equity. Okay, that makes sense. So then when we think about reducing drawdown in generating income, those two things are slightly counter opposing. So then the next question for you is which one of those matters more. And then by going through this kind of exercise, you can very clearly literally dial in exactly what makes the most sense.

So let's start with this portfolio fit idea. Let's use literally what the portfolio looked like earlier this week. It's a fantastic example because it's very current. So I had recently gotten back from traveling last week, I think. I don't remember. I think it was last week. And before I go to travel, I typically have a generally blank slate, not blank slate in that all my trades come off, but I pretty much just keep my course stuff on.

    "text": "imperative when I looked at the portfolio was I need risk. Okay, that doesn't help me much, but it does tell me that I need to use some money. So then the next thing I need to figure out is what do I think about the broad market? What is my current broad market assumption? And based on this, I essentially need to overlay all of those other details. So for example, this really starts from this stage here where we're thinking about how something will fit into the portfolio based on the broad market assumption. So here, essentially, I would say before you begin the scanning process in this stage, we need to assess market. I guess it's really not even assess, it's just analyze. So this would be analyze the market, create a hypothesis, then we would begin the scanning process and ask, how does this trade fit with the portfolio? I like that. So after I looked at the portfolio and I say, I need risk, I conduct that market analysis. And as I'm looking at the market, I'm saying, well, short term price up, short term price is going up, longer term, there's a lot of pressure. So I don't really have an opinion, but I favor the downside right now. So what does that tell me? Well, as I look at the overall portfolio, I'm long beta-weighted delta's to spy. So I'm overall long, but that kind of contradicts my longer term idea here. So",

Well, as I look at the overall portfolio, I'm long beta-weighted delta's to spy. So I'm overall long, but that kind of contradicts my longer term idea here. So then what I start doing is I start looking for other kinds of things that fit the broad portfolio based on this idea. So by clearly defining upfront, not by going out looking at the market, I do that anyways, but by literally starting the process from a point of what does the portfolio need based on my current overall market assessment and the current portfolio construction, I can naturally back myself into different things. So like, for example, am I going to go out there and sell puts on spy? No, I know that. Am I going to go out there and start selling short puts or long calls on any of the mag seven? No. And it's because I'm already exposed to them via SSO T triple cues, which is the bulk of the portfolio that I'm sharing with you guys right now, the model coverage triangle portfolio. So that risk is already there. So I already know I need to look in other places. So when you clearly define these things, it literally naturally starts limiting some of your selection criteria.

It's a really common misconception. People say like, oh, sell calls to reduce the risk on the portfolio. And it's not wrong in the sense that it can help. But it's not like this. It's really not the primary purpose of what that is. So let's take a look at a company. Let's take a look at Nvidia. And let's go back in time. Let's go back to the 14th of April. And let's take a look at this scenario operationalized. We're going to go to 14 Feb. And let's say that we wanted to buy shares. And we'll track them in here for the sake of this example. Now this one's good. This really doesn't have anything. So let's say we have whatever size portfolio. Let's say that you have 100,000 portfolio. That's our go-to.

Which again is not fully wrong. But how far to the downside does this actually help you? Well, you can literally just effectively take this off from whatever your basis is. And that's when you're going to start to be in trouble. So if you take a look at where your break even is here, that like 132, 36 ish, right? So literally all we're doing is taking our cost basis less the overall premium received. So our cost basis is 136. We know that we're going to get protection in this case down to 132.

For a retail trader to even give a shit about hedging a 3.4 downside move is completely folly. So this is not to talk out against short calls, short calls and covered calls and ratio covered calls are great. But again, this goes back to setting good expectations and clearly defining what the fuck we're trying to do. And the use case for short calls in this context, sure, it does absolutely scrub a little bit of downside, but it scrubs so little downside that it effectively doesn't even register that it's scrubbing downside. It doesn't fucking matter because the time that you need this protection is not when the stock is down 3.4. It's when it's down 15 fucking percent. So let's take a look at what happens as we go forward. And we'll just go to like March 25th because I like that number. And the stock is now at 120. So what's happened here? Well, pretty simple.

Fucking awesome. Right. So if we look at this as a percentage, you're still down pretty big. And again, if we just compare the difference between these, you'll find this as the variance between those. So that's kind of the funny thing about this idea of short calls as some sort of downside hedge. They're really not. They're the reason why people do that is because they want to make them out to be again, it's Goldilocks analysis. People want to be able to say things like, Oh, well, I get to hold a stock that I like and I get to sell something and collect money for it. And it hedges me to the downside. Sounds sick. But kind of again, not really representative of reality. Reese says not on topic, but have you ever overcome not taking losses personally? I've had a remind myself it should hurt a little. I mean, honestly, it doesn't hurt. It really doesn't hurt. I don't care. The concept of wins and losses for somebody like me as a trader is, it is all about the system.

Lauren says I lost one K of 5K last month, almost built it back, but very chaotic. Like a cow trying to ice skate. Well, Lauren, I think you're also in that scenario where you're still probably just bouncing around and not like my guess is if I ask you if you have a written trading plan and a developed trading log. Again, I don't know. You can correct me if I'm wrong, but my guess is you would say no, that would be my guess. And the reason is because that kind of drawdown doesn't necessarily that doesn't happen that naturally. It's not like a terrible drawdown like you're fine. But the that kind of drawdown with otherwise where you likely are at shouldn't necessarily be that frequent unless it was some sort of risk that you knowingly took, knowingly accepted, and then chose to still say, okay, like this is a big risk or whatever, but I'm comfortable with it. And I'm going to take it anyways for whatever reason. That's a bit of a different scenario on a comparative basis. But the way that we simplify that learning process",

And by entirely focusing on the process, your approach as a trader. If you do that, that will naturally lead to you starting to size down your trades because you don't need to put on a big trade because of the 5,000 account, it literally doesn't matter. Lauren says, I have a log, but it's written in a notebook. I'm basically a boomer. That's good. And I'm actually glad that you like that's still better than nothing. But unfortunately, that isn't really going to serve the purpose that you need it to because the whole point of having a log is to be able to conduct like data analysis. If you go back to one of the recent points in that little slide show that I made for you guys, objectivity is very important.

So putting it in a notebook, honestly, is good. I'm actually happy to hear that you're doing that. But it's still really not enough. And it's specifically for that reason.

And my vision for this one is to talk to you about things like how to actually make money as a trader, how to build an options portfolio, how to manage risk. So the next step in this is actually building the building blocks and the approach that we intend to take as a trader. And then after that we'll talk about the actual execution of those things. And then we'll talk about how to continually iterate so that we can ingest new information about what we're doing and optimize. The biggest takeaway for today that I want to make sure you walk away with is that as an options trader, you are in a very competitive space that's complex. You are the captain of your own ship. You have to align yourself internally to avoid these very common starting points for traders, moderate your expectations, figuring out what to focus on and when and again, if you have no idea, you can go to my website.

    "text": "to align yourself internally to avoid these very common starting points for traders, moderate your expectations, figuring out what to focus on and when and again, if you have no idea, you can go to my website. There's that options trading guide. And then after that, you can go to again, things like MIT OpenCourseWare and grab a course on their options trading. You can grab options as a strategic investment. Before you do anything else, you should do one of those three things. And for those that are like, well, I like to learn this way or I'm more of a practical learner, you're not. You're not going to magically be a practical learner in the option space. It's just not how it works. You have to understand some of the concepts of it first. So before you do anything else, that education has to come here. And then you start working on the rest of your requirements as a trader organization. This is the basis for iteration, tracking, and analysis. That process that we talked about is how you ingest everything and then always remembering that you absolutely have to be able to objectively analyze what you're doing, otherwise this feedback loop becomes completely meaningless. So that's what I got. That's what's in store for next Friday. Tomorrow we have the GME live stream. And then on Sunday, we have the pro trading prep live stream. So I hope you guys enjoy your weekend. I'll see you all",
