    "text": "what's up everyone quick update on GameStop simply because we're at the end of the week we have earnings coming up and some interesting Behavior today so the last time we spoke we were talking about how I was really digging that it looks like it's consolidating up kind of in this mid to high 20 handle which is fantastic and what I found of interest is I'm keeping a really close eye on the volume and what I want to detect is how price behav as volume is moving around and one of the things I noticed even on today is that it had a very very low low um open close range right it opened at 2788 closed at 2742 so like a140 range really really small range but look at the volume it contracted quite a lot we've gone from a 5-day average volume of 112 mil 20-day average volume of about 12 mil down to 8 mil so volume is Contracting and what I like about this is that even though volume is Contracting it's still hanging up in the 20s now I know a lot of people were hopeful that we would crack above 30 it looked like it was genuinely a potential but it definitely seems like things slow down a little bit and today was a little bit of a lighter expiration we obviously had decent exposure here in 22 no but it wasn't crazy right so it was 93,000 options against 15,879",
