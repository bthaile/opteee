    "text": "What's up outliers, quick market update? I want to talk about two things. The first thing is just some general broad market updates and flow as we're getting into this next interesting period next week of the Fed rate cuts expected on 18 September. And then I want to talk a little bit about game stop just because we came up on another expiration. So I'm going to get us prepped up for our game stop live stream tomorrow at 5 PM. So let's get right in. What's going on in the market? A pretty big turnaround. That's what I noticed this week, writ large. So if we take a look across the different sectors, we can see that the SP 500 is now kind of hovering right near all time highs again. It's rallied right back up. It's had a fairly one sided move starting from the ninth. We can see tech is still rallying. It's lagging behind the SP 500 still. It is still a bit away from all time, well, near term highs. I should say here as compared to spy. And then the Russell caught a really big bid today except it still is not even getting near its near term lower highs, let alone near term highs. So the Russell is also lagging quite a bit. Vix is down 16 and a half bonds are up. So what's going on here? Well, in my opinion, it looks like the market is starting to price in",

Well, in my opinion, it looks like the market is starting to price in a little bit more. This whole probability of a cut and we're trying to see how things are going to settle. You can see for the New York Stock Exchange net highs lows, the net lows essentially evaporated. There's on a gross low basis. There's 10. So the New York Stock Exchange is really starting to take off pretty meaningfully here. If we take a look at the NASDAQ, it's still gaining momentum but nothing near like what you're seeing in the New York Stock Exchange. So from a broader perspective here, the market I find to be at still a very interesting point, I don't read into this move too much. I'm playing it. I'm both long right now, futures and options in all of the indices. I have positions in E minis, cues and Russell. And that's mostly just following the movement at this point. It's not that I'm fully sold and baked in on what this movement looks like because a big thing that's going to start getting factored into pricing soon is what we think about recession. It's a little too early to worry too much about it yet, but that is going to become increasingly",

It's a little too early to worry too much about it yet, but that is going to become increasingly topical. Last I saw from Goldman Sachs. They had an article out that talked about like a 20 chance of recession, which I argue. It seems a little low to me, not that I know better than them. I just can't help it think that after everything that's gone on to think that it would be that low just seems not highly probable. But again, that's just based on essentially intuition. So I wouldn't wait my opinion there too heavily. So that's that. Now as I already mentioned, we do have a big rate cut coming soon. And when I say rate cut, it's been priced in for some time now. We've been looking at essentially a hundred percent probability of a cut since this new expiration became the front expiration. So on 18 sap is what we're looking at now, you can see what bonds were pricing off of. And here's the interesting point. It used to be really high probability of 25 basis points. Now it's like 50 50 between 25 and 50 basis points. It's turned a relatively not exciting event in my opinion, and you quite in exciting event. The reason is because I felt the",

It's turned a relatively not exciting event in my opinion, and you quite in exciting event. The reason is because I felt the probability of a 25 basis point had been priced in for some time. And we can see that because across the futures, if we look at the bond futures, you can see that they've rallied, but their volume is already started dying down. It's not like the volume is pouring into bonds at this point. It's really not. There's this really interesting phenomenon that we're seeing because I think most of this probability of a 25 basis point cut probably started getting priced in pretty heavily back here. And we've been, you know, me entering sideways here, but the revival of a 50 basis point cut, I actually think starts to make this look a little more interesting. And the ability for that to have a little bit more of a market effect, I think is pronounced. But if we look across again 30 year bonds here for the last week, essentially, it's been running below both five day and 20 day average volume. If we take a look at something a little near term, and we use 10 years, you'll see the same exact thing. It's been below volume most of the week. And then if we go even",

And then if we go even closer still, look at the two year, it's about the same still. So bonds are being bought no doubt. And I think most people have already captured most of this move. This is again, of reflection of the market as a discounting mechanism for those that are thinking like, oh, I want to get in a bonds today because I think the Fed rate cuts going to move prices literally like not even days late over a month or two late. That already has happened. Again, you can see that back here, clear as day. That's exactly what this is. Now it continues to drift up. I'm not saying that this is the maximum of the move or at all that it can't continue at sure can. But what I'm saying is that if you're arriving to that conclusion now, you are late to the party. So that doesn't mean you can't play it. But it just means you now have a higher risk trade because if for whatever reason, the economy starts faltering, it starts looking a little bit ugly to the downside, then we don't really know exactly how bonds are going to behave there because the bond",

It's just now just starting to normalize. So I don't even think it's fair to say like, oh, yeah, if you know, it starts looking like recession, bonds are going to look really good. Maybe. I mean, we might think that, but we also have to understand the rest of the conditions that are around us because again, correlations change over time and they did pretty massively. So for people that used to run risk on risk off portfolios using equities bonds, they were getting massacred over the last few years because the relationship broke. So yeah, that's kind of what I see going on with the bond market. Now the other thing I want to take a look at is the movement of capital between the sectors. I find interesting.

There's a few things that jump out at me when I'm looking at this down here is when we look at where most of the exposure is, again, we can see technology is contracting. It continues to contract quarter over quarter. So it hits peak concentration like back in here, which is around Q3 of 21, Q2, 22 somewhere in that range and it's been contracting ever since. That's a lie. Did tick up here, my bad. I lied to you. Where is this? This is like, yeah, 23, Q2, ish. But then it's been contracting from there for real this time. So this idea that like we're heavy tech concentration, I actually think is a little misguided at this point. Now it's important to also understand this is looking at when we're looking at sector exposure and people, if we look at individual products, we can absolutely see that we're still very, very heavy into tech. And so if we sort this by ads, you can see Burke Shires coming up really big Google, AMSCI, ACN, Boba. So it's like a healthy mix of things.

And if we take a look at offloads or kind of the smallest ads, it's been an energy, which, again, that's no big surprise because if you take a look at energy's composition in these portfolios, it's been super, super low for some time. So what I'm noticing from an expanding standpoint is if you look at industrials, they're starting to open up a little bit. You're seeing consumer defensive. It opened up, kind of started closing back down. I don't think there's a lot there that interests me at the moment, just from a flow perspective. And then we absolutely see financial services opening up. So when I say opening up, I mean, consuming more of transactions and the percentages of portfolios. So to recap all of that from what I see now, I think the market has already largely priced into 25 basis point cut. If not a 50 basis point cut probability at this point, I think if it is a 50 basis point cut, the market will probably move pretty heavy off of that because it will still be relatively new news. That's not fully priced in the exit. It's even still less than a 50 probability. But if it keeps trending that way, I think it becomes more probable. So interesting market behavior this week. And this is where, again, until the market decides if it's going to go left or go right, this is exactly where I",

And this is where, again, until the market decides if it's going to go left or go right, this is exactly where I like to trade these markets, but you got to be really careful. And I use really tight stops, even the stuff that I'm running in the NASDAQ. I just follow it all the way up. And for things that I typically would handle a previous retracement without batting an eyelash, I would rather just get out, watch, and then go back in. I haven't been knocked out yet, but I have literally orders resting right now to start dropping me out if need be. All right. So let's switch over to GameStop quick. And then for those that don't know, later today at 5 pm Pacific Time, we have the outlier options trading for beginners series. That's at 5 pm Pacific Time. And we dive into the world of options for beginners. So it's a chance to get your feet wet. We've been doing, I think this is going to be our 14th episode. So we're going to have a quiz.

It's really just designed to help people sharpen the sword, get more familiar with options more comfortable with how they fit in the portfolio, understand the difference between things like profit mechanisms and how to capitalize on them with options. Because options get a bad rap, but it's because people jump into them too fast is what it boils down to. So going over to GameStop, a little bit of an update today. That was absolutely awesome to see inside day 1.23 up, but it's still hovering right above 20. So the fact that it's continuing to hold this is good to see. And if we take a look at volume, we can see that there was a spike of volume leading into earnings, post earnings, another spike of volume. And then if we take a look, even at these last two days, although these last two days seem insignificant compared to the prior four, these last two days are still much larger than a lot of what you saw in here. Right? So today we had 8 million volume 9.5 million volume yesterday. If we go back to a random sample during this period, it's 4.5, 3.5, so much, much, much less volume in here. So there's still elevated volume. And I think that that's an important note because it tells me that we're still supported here. Now whether it breaks down below this, TBD, don't know yet.",

And I'm keeping a pretty close eye on that. Now let's jump over to the options chain. And we have a few things to go over in here. So today, we had 172,000 calls against 49,000 puts, so way more calls traded. And again, this looks like mostly moving out into the next expiration. Right? So we can see a bunch of these 13 September. These are almost assuredly trades that are coming down. And these 20 steps are going to almost all be opening trades for people moving out into the next primary expiration. Open interest, still hovering right around 730,000 calls against 361 on the put side. And it's still a healthy mix of call, open interest across different explorations. I'm not seeing any sort of massive concentration here that leads me to believe that, you know, the market is pricing something in or the market thinks something in particular is going on. I just don't get that sense at least as of right now. So let's take a quick look now at any interesting trade volume that we've had come through. I'm going to get rid of the",

And I'm going to limit it to just today to kind of clear out some of that noise. We had a couple trades that looked interesting to me. But so we have the 18th of next month, the 15 calls. I thought those looked a little off place, but not much. It is a bigger trade 200 and 87,000. Again, it's not big by typical game stop standards when things are really busy. But it's something I'm just looking at. And then we have another 174,000 dollar trade, but this is an out until 2025. So yeah, you know, future dated positioning totally fine, but beyond that, just pretty quiet in here. Not much to highlight that looks really interesting to me or anything like that. Now, I do want to take a look at the dark pool really fast and see what kind of transactions we had today. And if we take a look, there's a bunch of those 5,000s again. So I'm going to do a sort of spicy, see if the 5,000s are in here, typically they're not. Because there's a bunch of much",

Well, for I'm going to look at just today though. And let's see. Yep, look at all these 5s again. This is like, this has been nonstop the last few days. So let's count. So and there's a couple over here that are like different sizes right, 5500, but these, what is this? It's like over 30, maybe like 35 or so. And then I see a couple of high force. So interesting. Really interesting. I don't know what to make of the 5s. Their activity has been ebbling and flowing. So if we look at this over the last week, for example, I'm going to filter by just those 5,000.

That's what I'm looking at right now. Obviously, that's what I see over the 12th to today. And that's what I'm keeping an eye by all on. Because the option of change right now is quiet. It is what it is. Is exciting as I would prefer it to be. Right now it's quiet. The stock price itself is quiet, which, again, is we know with game stop, it's quiet until it's not.
