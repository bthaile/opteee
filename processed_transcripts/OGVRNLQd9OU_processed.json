I am in the process of reconfiguring the live streams yet again you know it goes kind of just move stuff around tinker with different ideas and the game plan for the Wednesday stream is to revert back to something that we were slightly doing earlier but kind of ran out of time in the prior stream cadence where what I want to do is use the Wednesday stream as an opportunity to recap the markets super fast instead of spending a lot of time deeping digging into just analyzing markets we do enough of that in the other streams that I don't think it's huge value add in this context and what I would like to do is get back to the prior structure I had developed that that keeps the ball rolling with respect to building skills so if you will recall some time ago hot minute ago at this point I used to do on Wednesday like a skilled development and then on Thursday for the pro members is when we would kind of double click into that skill development stream and I want to get back to that and the main reason is because there is an opportunity there for us to work on practical skills during the live streams together which I always imagine is valuable the way that I",
