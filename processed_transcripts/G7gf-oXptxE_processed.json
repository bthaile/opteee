    "text": "so we use the black shoals martin model when we're pricing options you've heard that before all good now once we understand options a little bit more we come to find out that all of the assumptions in the bsm are not exactly correct one of which is how it integrates implied volatility into the pricing of options primarily how it assumes implied volatility so this video is going to talk about the implied volatility surface and the implied volatility smile so that anybody that trades options that's interested in the inner workings can have a better understanding on how premiums are actually calculated because they are not calculated in a textbook fashion as the black shoals model would assume so what's up everybody eric here welcome back to all the outliers and again we have a little more of a technical session here but i aim to make this video consumable we're going to keep it to less than 10 minutes but i'm hoping to share some useful information so that you can understand the underside of options a little more holistically so let's jump over and get to it so as i already mentioned the black shoals martin model it comes with a whole list of assumptions and not all of them are accurate one of which is the pricing of an underlying security and the reason why that matters is because it impacts how implied volatility is assumed to be so when we're talking about the bsm",
