    "text": "So we use the Black Sholes Merton model when we're pricing options. You've heard that before, all good. Now once we understand options a little bit more, we come to find out that all of the assumptions in the BSM are not exactly correct. One of which is how it integrates implied volatility into the pricing of options, primarily how it assumes implied volatility. So this video is going to talk about the implied volatility surface and the implied volatility smile so that anybody that trades options that's interested in the inner working can have a better understanding on how premiums are actually calculated because they're not calculated in a textbook fashion as the Black Sholes model would assume. So what's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers. And again, we have a little more of a technical session here, but I aim to make this video consumable. We're going to keep it to less than 10 minutes, but I'm hoping to share some useful information so that you can understand the under side of options a little more holistically. So let's jump over and get to it. So as I already mentioned, the Black Sholes Merton model, it comes with a whole list of assumptions and not all of them are accurate. One of which is the pricing of an underlying security and the reason why that matters is because it impacts how implied volatility is assumed to be. So when we're talking about the BSM,",

One of which is the pricing of an underlying security and the reason why that matters is because it impacts how implied volatility is assumed to be. So when we're talking about the BSM, it normally assumes a log normal distribution, which in this scenario, I'm specifically referring to the cumulative distribution of a log normal distribution. I mentioned that because a log normal distribution can look very different depending on what level of statistics you've taken and how often you use this stuff. So really when I'm saying log normal or normal distribution in this context, I'm referring to the cumulative distribution of a log normal distribution. Okay, so got it. I just said the same couple of words a few times. What the hell does it mean? Let's talk about it. So down below, right below those words, I have what a cumulative distribution of a log normal distribution can look like. And what you're seeing here is also what is commonly referred to as a normal distribution, where we have the mean in the middle and then we have symmetrical tails to both positive and negative sides of the mean. However, this is not how price is actually observed in the marketplace. And because that is not how price is actually observed in the marketplace, that is also not how implied volatility is calculated. Because again, implied volatility is essentially just",

And because that is not how price is actually observed in the marketplace, that is also not how implied volatility is calculated. Because again, implied volatility is essentially just our assessment of future price movement and deviation off of a mean. So when we talk about options, implied volatility and price, they both do not exhibit a normal distribution. They have both either or or both kurtosis and skew. So what is kurtosis and what is skew? Essentially both kurtosis and skew lead to fat tails in our data. And I don't know about you, but nothing gets me going like a good ol fat tail in statistics. But on the left hand side here, I'm showing you two things. I'm showing you what kurtosis looks like and then I'm showing you what skew looks like. So kurtosis, which is this bit up here, we have three different kinds. This is in the statistics course. I'm not going to go into all of them. The punchline here is as we see different styles of kurtosis, an important function is occurring. The tails represent the far ends of the data set. And typically speaking, as you can see over here, when we're looking at a normal distribution, it assumes that there is a very, very small amount, small number of occurrences that take place as we get to the extremes",

And typically speaking, as you can see over here, when we're looking at a normal distribution, it assumes that there is a very, very small amount, small number of occurrences that take place as we get to the extremes of the data set or the tails. However, when we have kurtosis, we increase likelihood of occurrence in a tail. So for example, if you look at just regular stock market prices and you plot them out, it is not a normal distribution. We exhibit and experience moves that statistically would be unsound in a normal distribution more frequently than we should. So part of that is due to kurtosis. And that's just a function of the pricing of the markets and the way things that move. The other function that we see sometimes is skew, where normally if we have a symmetrical distribution, again, both sides of the distribution would have the similar shape, just like you see here. Although this looks like it has cancer and a lot of growths because I can't draw straight with the mouse, but you get the idea. And then on the positive skew, negative skew, essentially again, what you're seeing is an increase or decrease likelihood of occurrences within a tail. So if we look at this example of a negative skew, we see that the tail actually raises up on this side compared to this side, which means that we experience",

So why did I just go into an impromptu session on basic statistics? Well, it's because all of this leads to what I'm about to talk about, which is the vaultally surface. So this in and of itself is not the funnest stuff to go through. So if you made it, be sure to like the video, let us know that you got through at least the first half. Now let's transition over to the output. So we now understand what the blacksholes model assumes. Now we also understand that that's not actually what the market exhibits. So let's talk about how we compensate and what we use is the vaultally surface and vaultally smiles. So on the center of the screen there, this is a chart I pulled from Investopedia, which pulled from Wikipedia, which I have no idea who the original author is, but it's a very reasonable chart. So I didn't bother making one. And it shows you the implied vaults, letty surface. So what I want to highlight is there are a couple different aspects to it. We have time to maturity over here",

How far something is in or out of the money on this axis? And then we have the implied volatility on this axis. The blacksholes model would essentially assume that the implied volatility surface would be flat. So that means we use the same implied volatility for the same series time expiration of options across the different series. But that's not what we do. What happens is if we open up the trading platform and we take a look at let's pick this options change. So this is in the spy and I'm looking at the 19 August 31 options change. I want you to notice something. If I take a look at this column right here on the put side, this is implied volatility. The furthest one I have listed here as of right now is a 12 delta and it's a 29.23 implied volatility. Then if I go to the at the money option, I see 22.9 22.8. And then if I go further in the money, I see 22.7. And then I see a period a little further in that's 20.31. All of that is just on the put side.",

If we look at the implied volatility for this options chain, which means this specific expiration, it's 24.78. If I look at the implied volatility for spy in general, it's 24.69. If we go back into the 19 August and we look at the call side and let's find a 12 delta call. So that would put us out here. The 12 delta call implied volatility is 18.51. So what you're seeing is the same delta out of the money option for calls and puts is different. But there's a couple important trends that you should have noticed as I ran through that, which is the smile, which we'll get into in just a second. But essentially by looking at the moneyness for different options, the different times to expiration, time to maturity, DTE, we're seeing that there are different implied volatility, which is why it's called a volatility surface because it's taking in multiple inputs and it's giving you exactly this. It's a surface profile where we can experience different implied vultilities for different series of options in the same expiration or different expirations. The main punchline is it's not the same as the blacksholes model would assume. So",

The main punchline is it's not the same as the blacksholes model would assume. So I showed you that the call implied volatility was different than the put implied volatility for the same out of the money delta. Why? That's because of the volatility smile. So essentially on a vertical axis here, we have implied volatility. And then on the horizontal axis here, we have the strike price. So whether it's in the money or out of the money, and we're looking at puts here, but essentially we see a little bit of a smile unless there's a skew in the smile or kurtosis, which can occur. But essentially what it means is that again, the implied volatility for different series, different strikes is not flat. It's not equal. We have at the money typically be seems to be lower implied volatility, whereas deep out of the money or deep in the money tends to have increased implied volatility. As you saw in that example, I just showed you it's not always the case, but very frequently is the case. It is product specific. So to recap, because I got 10 minutes and 40 seconds, I want to keep my promise. After all, the blacksholes model in a vacuum assumes a log normal distribution, which",

After all, the blacksholes model in a vacuum assumes a log normal distribution, which is the cumulative distribution of a log normal distribution. That has certain series of assumptions that I showed to you are not the case. So what that leaves us with is people that interact with the markets create implied volatility services for the individual securities that they're trading based on their series of assumptions to arrive at what they perceive to be the correct implied volatility for that product. And that leads to different implied volatilities for various strikes within the same expiration and within different explorations. So all of this is to say that the market, at least at this point, is pricing in different volatility than the blacksholes model would assume. And it is because the market does not move the way that the blacksholes model assumes that it does. We have fat tails. We have more outlier cases than we would expect to see. And that is exactly why the volatility surface is not flat in why we have a volatility smile.
