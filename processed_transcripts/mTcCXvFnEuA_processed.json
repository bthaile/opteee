And I'm going to walk you through an example at the very end. So with that, let's get right to it. For those that don't know, this is essentially a part of my covered strangle strategy. We're just breaking out a specific segment and applying it to the people that like to trade covered calls because a lot of folks like to do that. And that's totally cool. We're going to start with looking at a covered call for context. The assumption here is that you already generally know what this is. But if you don't, I'll give you a quick recap. A covered call typically means we're going to have the same overall delta potential for long and short delta's. So in this case, we have a one to one or a two to two reduced down one to one. So this is long 200 shares of Tesla and short two calls. So what this means is we have a maximum of long 200 delta's from our shares and then a maximum of negative 200 delta's from the short calls. And that leads to this right here. You'll notice once we get to the max profit potential for the trade, which is going to be our short call strike, plus whatever premium we receive from the trade and any incremental change over that",

As in if the underlying continues to rally, it doesn't matter. Our profit potential is capped at that maximum profit zone. Let's compare that to the ratio covered call. And as you'll notice right out of the gate, we have a slightly different risk profile where that same scenario that I was just showing you doesn't exist. We have unlimited upside potential. How does this happen? Well, it means that we're going to have more long deltas than short deltas. So in this same exact scenario, I am long 200 shares of Tesla. So that's our stock position down here. But I'm only short one covered call or one call against those 200 shares. So I have 200 maximum long deltas and negative 100 maximum short deltas.

Those short calls can be out of the money in which case we just go back and start over again. Or those short calls can be in the money. Then we have two choices. We can either roll that position if we want to try and defend the in the money short calls. That kind of brings us back up to this scenario. Or we can allow assignment where our long shares are going to be called away. So that is essentially allowing the long shares that are tied up.

Because if we think the underlying is going to go up into perpetuity and we're still really bullish, then I wouldn't flatten.

So I'm going to zoom us out to 10 February quick so you can kind of see the flow of the trade.

So I'm going to take this back out and we're going to go to 6 Jan and then we're going to essentially establish a ratio covered call. So to do that, I'm going to buy instead of sell.

So I'm going to do 500 shares, send those out the door and most people when they're selling a covered call, they'll kind of offer all of their options at once. So let's say we go out to like a 34 delta something like that and let's say that we're going to sell five here. So now what you'll notice and I'm getting instant fills because it's all fake. This is paper. If you'll notice we have 500 long delta and we have negative 500 short delta. So this is a covered call in our maximum profit potential is going to be realized at 130 plus the premium received, which is 540. So 135 40 and let's now fast forward and see what the result of this is. I'm just going to take us right up to expiration to save us some time here. And in this case, you can see that we had obviously an insane rally during the life cycle of this trade. So with that big ol' rally, this trade would be walking out at a overall PNL of 10,950 give or take. So this is showing us what this one instance would look like if we sold all five short calls at once. Now a quick admin note, if you are trading the covered strangle, or I'm sorry, I used that",

Now a quick admin note, if you are trading the covered strangle, or I'm sorry, I used that strategy so much, I literally just say it. But if you are trading the covered call, one of the simplest ways you can optimize your performance is instead of offering all five short calls at once in this scenario would be to sell one each week. And it avoids this exact scenario where all of your short calls are out there and the underlying made this big move. Sometimes we can do that, sometimes we can't. If you still prefer the covered call, that's what I would do to modify this. Now that part aside, let's talk about the PNL of the trade. So as we can see, we made 41, 825 on the underlying and we lost 3875 on the shorts. Obviously, we'll keep the premium we collected. And that premium we collected is an important note because that's going to be one of the big differences between this and the other version of this. So in total, we collected 2,700 in premium upfront. Okay, cool. So let's go ahead and reset this whole shebang.

We're going to go back in time to the same exact starting point, six Jan and instead of the previous example where we had a covered call, we're going to do an uncovered call. Now my typical preference for the uncovered call as I was just highlighting would be instead of just selling all of my short calls in this expiration, it would be to ladder them out week over week. So something I might do to that example would be sell to in the 13 Jan, two in the 20 Jan, two in the 27 Jan or one in the 27 Jan or zero in the 27 Jan. It depends on how you want to spread them out. But essentially, I would want to make sure I have at least 100 shares uncovered. So, but to keep it closer to an apples to apples comparison, I'm not going to say, I'm not going to do any of that. I'm going to pick our very same short call here and instead of selling five, we're literally just going to sell four, maybe three, if you're super bullish in this case, I was, but again, to keep it to a closer non preferential look back, I'm going to say that we sold four.

If I'm thinking about whether it's a covered call or a ratio covered call, the closer I can trade, typically the happy I am, and it's because it allows me to get more cycles in, you're going to make aggregate more money that way than going further out in time. The other thing I'm going to try to do is find a balance. So let's say that I want to do this 35 days expiration. I want it to be above my cost basis. That's for sure.

And if so, you might go further out of the money so that you are not getting stuck on cat upside potential prematurely. If you want to unwind the position, you've had it for a long time. It's already made the move you thought it should make. It's time to rebalance the portfolio risk, things like that. Maybe you sell closer at the money and accept that trade off. I'm going to make more money up front, but if I do get a big run, I'm going to miss out on it totally up to you. You got to figure out what's right.

    "text": "of five and I'm going to do the same exact things. Last time we're going to fast forward right to expiration. Last time we made about 10 grand, something like that. And in this case, we're at 17, 1, 2, 5. So you can see it's a much greater return potential. This is an extreme example to be abundantly clear because this is a huge move to have in a short period of time. But if I'm trading something like a covered call or a ratio covered call, this is what I want to see. This is the scenario I'm attempting to expose myself to. So that's why I selected this one. The main trade off here is if the opposite happened and we moved down, I just would have collected less money up front. So that's the trade off here. You can either have much greater profit potential if you use uncovered or I don't use uncovered because that's kind of synonymous with naked short calls. But in this case, they're covered because you have the underlying, but you're selling them out of ratio. You're just uncovering your upside potential. So the ratio covered call favors giving us upside potential, but it finds a balance between upside potential, but still collecting enough money up front. Because in this scenario, you essentially just collected 500 less because it's one lot less, but you unlocked significantly more profit potential if you get the big move that you think might happen. So",
