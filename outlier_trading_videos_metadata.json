He offers up his expertise in the options markets as co-host of tastylive LIVE!, airing daily on the tastylive network.\n\nA former floor trader, Tom became one of Chicago's most well-known serial entrepreneurs in fintech when he built a breakthrough options-trading platform, thinkorswim, later sold to TD-Ameritrade for $750 million.\n\nLeveraging over 20 years of experience as a Market Maker for the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and one of the original OEX traders in the S&P 100 Index pit, Tom pursued his vision to educate retail investors in options trading and build a superior trading platform and a brokerage firm that specialized in options. With that vision in mind, tastylive was founded in 2011.
